Pip's Soul Calibur 3 Notes:

5B5EdYP Gold Duplication Cheat:
 0) 'Main Menu' -> 'Single Player Modes' -> 'Chronicles of the Sword' -> 'New Game'
 1) Make plain Barbarians with all the slots you have to create characters.
 2) Sortie your Barbarians before any supplied characters and rely heavily on their 44B move from far during every battle.
 3) Play CotS seriously up until the first Chronicle where your main character's death is a loss condition and don't spend any gold.
 4) Fail that Chronicle by letting your main character die and choose 'Return to Title' and then 'Yes' to "Save current game play?".
 5) 'Main Menu' -> 'Shop' and spend all your gold then press Select+Start to hot-reset the game (Do NOT save before the hot-reset).
 6) 'Main Menu' -> 'Single Player Modes' -> 'Chronicles of the Sword' -> 'Load' and choose your Barbarian CotS save game.
 7) Return to step 4) until you have purchased everything in the 'Shop'.
