Voting Libertarian as well as I am able... I want smaller government first!
Then we can worry about worthwhile government-funded programs.

51J1HsR - heh... looks like I want smaller government last as well now that
I've learned a bit more about Libertarianism.  There are no worthwhile
government-funded programs in the long-term.  Let them compete on equal
footing in the marketplace, be profitable on their own && not require
involuntary tax-derived subsidies in order to operate inefficiently.  The
government should be tiny && limited to foreign diplomacy (no espionage).
