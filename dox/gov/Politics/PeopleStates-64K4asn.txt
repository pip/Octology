64K4asn - PeopleStates.txt created to describe my idea that each individual has their own boundaries (i.e., borders) and diplomacy... as they should.
Challenge people to remember individual freedom and responsibility and decision-making capacity.

Kevin also brought up the increasingly reasonable-sounding topic of California's new nation-hood (i.e., cessation from the United States).  He could possibly
be my running mate.  If this were to happen, and as much as I hate to care about first impressions, we might need to ask people to look beyond our white
maleness.  I wish I didn't have to be concerned with that at all.  As much as I want it to be a non-issue, maybe it must be discussed early and often.

The larger concern of potential civil war (or even just peaceful establishment of a new Californian country) is similarly profound in its impact.  I have
qualms about the idea because I want to use the United States to improve the world.  Starting relatively smaller (with just California) should be actually more
attainable but is it proportionally less worthwhile.  Maybe the United States should remain together.  I don't, at first blush, like the idea of leaving all
the other states out in the cold.  The problem is that maybe that is the right thing to do.

California may single-handedly have enough population and economy to stake a valid claim on autonomy.  California may embody more diversity, tolerance,
technology, culture, entertainment, art, etc. than any comparable competitor.  These issues recommend California for separation of church (the other 49 states)
and state (the Californian state of enlightenment).  The new single law of California will be: "Treat others as you wish to be treated."

Maybe it is better to found a new nation (Californication?) than to attempt to conquer the religious right?
