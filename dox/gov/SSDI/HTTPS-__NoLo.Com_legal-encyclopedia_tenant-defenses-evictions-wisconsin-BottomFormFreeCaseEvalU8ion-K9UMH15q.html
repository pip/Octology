To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Pip Stuart. I have suffered from BiPolar Type I (Hyper-Mania) episodes several times within the past 12 years. In Spring of 2010, my mom (Dottie Mathews) brought me to Appleton, Wisconsin to see if she could help me achieve some mental stability. Shortly after arriving, I was approved to receive SSDI (which I have remained on for over the past decade).

After 5 years of relative stability there (in Appleton from Spring 2010 - Summer 2015), both my lesbian moms (Dot Mathews and Rosie Geiser) with my landlord (Dan Mokrzycki) at that time, joined a 3-party commitment of me to Theda Clark Mental Hospital in Neenah, just prior to my moms and sister (Angie Stuart) moving South to Columbia, Missouri. Since that time, I have had no family and only very few friends, anywhere within the entire State of Wisconsin.

Back in 2015, I was placed on a commitment order through Winnebago County, so I moved down to Oshkosh to comply. I have lived in Captain's Cove at 812 Mallard Ave. Apt. #6, Oshkosh, Wi 54901 since then. In 2017, I was let off the commitment that had begun in 2015.

Then during Spring of 2019 (towards the beginning of last year), I experienced my second bout with Hyper-Mania over the prior 9 years. My downstairs neighbor, Mike Casperson in #2, had recently had his brother and his cat die, and he had indicated to me that both of those were due to his abuse. Then he told me that he would kill me and my cat. This worried me, and I didn't know where to turn, so I wrote (primarily in felt-marker) a description of the situation on the outer side of my door (#6) and his door (#2, directly downstairs).

At that time (Spring 2019), I was also told about the man who had been staying down in Unit #1 (below Larry Genz in Unit #5, who has been straight across from me). This man in #1 had repeatedly left his natural gas running out into the apartment (with no pilot-light lit, risking to blow-up the building) so many times (according to Mike C.) that supposedly the USPS mail-man was refusing to deliver directly to our building (for fear of explosion).

This is why I broke the glass protecting the upstairs fire-extinguisher at that time. The 3rd thing I had supposedly damaged at that time (besides black Sharpie marker on the doors and the fire-extinguisher glass) was the locked door to my mail-box. I had lost my only key, and the landlord (Doug Carder or C. something?) had insisted that I pay an expense which I was unable to afford, just to have my mail-key replaced. This unfair requirement was enforced despite acknowledging that all my rent payments (in almost the entire 4 prior years) had come on-time directly from my SSDI payee (Payment Partner) and my clear explanation that I would need to get into my mail-box in order to be able to retrieve the check from my payee, so that I could personally afford the mail-key replacement fee (which Doug was unwilling to charge properly to Payment Partner). So I used a hammer to pry open my mail-box door back then, so I could retrieve the money needed to feed myself and my cat, and to pay for the mail-key replacement (since I remained unable to otherwise).

Back during Spring of 2019, while I spent a week in jail before transferring to Winnebago Mental Health facility, Doug C. took out a restraining-order on me. He restricted me from returning to my apartment, my cat, and all my belongings. One of the websites I've looked up (which I can't find right now to cite a proper reference for, but will look around to find it again, when I can) has indicated that placing a restraining-order barring a tenant from accessing their home and belongings is against the law. Hopefully I can re-discover where this is specified.

As of today (Wed. Sep. 30th, 2020), both doors remain simply spray-painted over, the fire-extinguisher glass remains un-replaced, and my mail-box remains locked open and I have not yet received any replacement key. All 3 of these purported "damages" have remained this way throughout the entire past year and a half, demonstrating that none of them were significant or severe, back then or at any time since.

Now this year, on Sun. Sep. 13th of 2020, I had turned my stereo on after 9AM to play my music loud while working on my computers. The following day (Mon. Sep. 14th, 2020), Mike Casperson came to my door and threatened to kill me with a gun if I woke him up again around 9AM on a Sunday. This was the 3rd time Mike C. had directly threatened to kill me over (what should have been) minor offenses.

I left my landlord (Doug C.) a voicemail explaining that I needed my locks changed for my door, my mail-box, and my non-functional Carbon-Monoxide detector replaced. I also related that Mike C. had threatened to kill me over music disturbing him after 9AM, and that I thought he (Doug) should be aware of the growing strife between Mike and I.

Due to the stress and pressure that was escalating between Mike and I, I found myself unable to sleep that entire night due to the threat Mike posed to me and my cat. I know he (and his close friends, Larry #5 and Kim #3, together abbreviated M.L.K. with Jr. deceased from #4, or the young J., who was down in #1) collects deadly weapons. Mike and Larry have brandished and personally shown me displays of many knives and guns as proud decorations (with violent purposes) throughout their apartments.

To Whom It May Concern,

I have been Disabled (on SSDI) for over the past decade, suffering from BiPolar Type I Disorder. My downstairs neighbor, Mike Casperson, has threatened to kill me and my cat at least 3 times during the past 5 years that I've lived in Captain's Cove Apt. #6. The most recent of these events occurred on Mon. Sep. 14th of 2020. I left our landlord [ Doug C.: (920)233-0011 ] a voicemail describing that Mike had again threatened to kill me and my cat with an AR-15 or some-such gun, because my loud music being played after 9AM (during late morning daylight hours) had infuriated him to the point of declaring that he would commit homicide on me again. I know Mike (#2), Larry (#5), and Kim (#3)... collectively "M.L.K." with Jr. recently deceased from #4 or young J. from #1, these men proudly collect deadly weapons. Mike and Larry have shown me some of their weapon / arsenal collections in the past (back when all 3 of us used to get along better).

On Tue. Sep. 15th of 2020, I had been unable to sleep overnight due to Mike Casperson's threats to murder me and my cat, so I soothed myself by turning my music on somewhat loud around 6:30AM (when our day-time Sun-light had probably already begun rising). A bit later, while sitting and smoking tobacco in the stair-well of my apartment building, Mike emerged from his door below and started marching up the stairs at me offensively, aggressively, and menacingly. He proceeded to get right up in my face and personal-space, so I gave him a small shove back down the stairs. I am still unsure as to whether he had one or more of his knives or guns prepared to visit violence upon me at that time. That sure seemed to be his intention, as he ascended each step, approaching me with outwardly growing anger.

Someone called the police about the loud music that morning (although I do not yet know who it was), and when 2 officers had arrived, a young woman and young man (whose names I did not catch) approached me in the stairs and merely warned me, insisting that I please turn down my music volume (at least until 9AM, which I did), or else they would have to return to issue me a noise-complaint citation (which they didn't).

That afternoon, Officer Duane Ott arrived to interrogate me regarding the tension of the situation. Regardless of the more than half-dozen times I attempted to explain to him that Mike C. had threatened to kill me at least 3 times, before I told his friend Kim to tell him that if Mike insists on repeatedly threatening and initiating violence against me, I would eventually retaliate in self-defense. Officer Ott ignored every one of the many times I explained this, deliberately attempting to change the topic each time (to re-frame me as the initial aggressor, with him not accepting any possibility that I could be the victim). Later that evening (around 6 or 7PM), Officer Ott showed up again, along with a couple other masked middle-aged male officers. They said they were arresting me, but were unclear as to precisely why yet. Officer Ott said that they would figure out later why they were taking me to Mercy Medical Center.

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Pip Stuart. I have suffered from BiPolar Type I (Hyper-Mania) episodes several times within the past 12 years. In Spring of 2010, my mom brought me to Appleton, Wisconsin to try to help me achieve some mental stability. Shortly after arriving, I was approved to receive SSDI (which I have remained on for over the past decade).

After 5 years of relative stability there (in Appleton from Spring 2010 - Summer 2015), both of my lesbian moms with my then landlord (Dan Mokrzycki), joined a 3-party mental-health commitment of me to Theda Clark Mental Hospital in Neenah, just prior to my moms and sister moving South to Columbia, Missouri. Since that time (the past 5 years), I have had no family and only very few friends, anywhere within the entire State of Wisconsin.

Back in 2015, I was placed on a mental-health commitment order to remain in Winnebago County, so I moved down to Oshkosh (into Captain's Cove, 812 Mallard Ave. Apt. #6), where I and my cat have lived for over 5 years now.

Last year, during Spring of 2019, I had my second major Manic episode since relocating to Wisconsin, and I was forced into Winnebago Mental Health Institution. At that time, my downstairs neighbor, Mike Casperson (among others), threatened that he would kill me and my cat (like he had already done to his own brother and cat). I didn't know where to turn, so I wrote some of these details on the outer hallway sides of my door (#6) and Mike's below (#2). I also broke the glass to get at the nearby fire-extinguisher because I was worried for several reasons that fire or explosions might burst forth from below. The third thing I "damaged" was my own mail-box door and lock. I had lost my mail-key and when I went to the landlord (Doug C.) about it, he insisted that I needed to pay a replacement fee before he would allow me to obtain a new copy. I explained that for almost 4 entire years (back by that time), my payee (Payment Partner) had paid all of my rent on-time, and so he should simply obtain the mail-box key replacement cost from P.P. as well, or let me into my mail-box so that I could retrieve the check
from P.P. to me that was in there, and that I needed to afford food for myself and my cat and it would also enable me to pay for the lost-key fee. Landlord, Doug C., was unreasonable and I needed access to my mail to try to survive, so I pried the door and lock open when I could wait no longer to get my money.

Now on Sun. Sep. 13th of this 2020, I turned my music on after 9AM. The following day (Mon. Sep. 14th, 2020), my downstairs neighbor (Mike) came and banged loudly on my door. When I answered it, he shouted at me that he would kill me and my cat with what sounded like an AR-15 military-grade rifle. I know Mike has quite a collection of low to medium-grade knives on display in his living room, and his close friend Larry (who lives up in #5, straight across from me) owns many powerfully deadly weapons (including bayonet blades, brass-knuckle claw blades, pistols, and at least one rifle as well as the major pieces to a shotgun). I realized that Mike might either already have formidable weapons of his own that I haven't learned about him having yet, or he might gain access to Larry's advanced weapons (since he is a proud, retired Marine veteran, who stays well-armed).

I left my landlord (Doug C.) a voicemail message letting him know that Mike had threatened (for at least the 3rd time then) that he would literally kill me if my music woke him up around 9AM again.

To Whom It May Concern,

Hello. My name is Pip Stuart. I have been Disabled with BiPolar Type I Disorder and receiving SSDI benefits for over a decade. I have endured 3 forced hospitalizations since moving to Wisconsin in 2010. The first was in Summer of 2015 (after-which I moved from Appleton down to Oshkosh, due to my new mental-health commitment being bound to Winnebago County, since my Honey Lou Ct. apartment was just South of the Outagamie County border line). The second was during Spring of 2019 (last year). The third (and most recent) was early Fall of 2020 (starting just over 2 weeks ago).

This 3rd forced hospital stay began on Tue. Sep. 15th and ended Mon. Sep. 21st. The following day, on Tue. Sep. 22nd, my landlord (Doug C. -- (920)233-0011) served me a 28-Day Notice that he intends to terminate my tenancy, requiring me to move out on or before Oct. 19th, 2020. My payee (Payment Partner) has paid all of my rent on-time throughout the past 5 years. I recently (on July 24th, 2020) just signed a renewed year-long lease, which was supposed to span from Sep. 1st of this 2020 through Aug. 31st of 2021. The 28-Day Notice Terminating Tenancy refers to Wisconsin Statutes 704.19 which indicates in section (2)(b)(1) that the end of my rental period should be the end of the rental year.

Doug verbally called this an "Eviction Notice" but I observe that it doesn't mention eviction anywhere on the form here. Within the "Description of premises:" section, Doug has written: "2 bdrm apt -- drugs, damage to property, harassing tenant's, loud music all ours of day's" as 4 reasons he's intending to use to usher me out from my apartment prematurely. None of these reasons are valid.

No drugs have ever been found on me or in my apartment. I have not damaged any property (at least during Sep. 2020, and probably not during Spring of 2019 either, if that's what he's trying to refer to now). I have not harassed other tenants. I have kept my music quiet almost all times after 10PM and before 9AM (which is when the local Police Officers had indicated was acceptable, when warning me about an anonymous noise-complaint, but they did not issue me any formal citation, at that time or at any other time since then).

Please help me fight this termination notice and help me and my cat to stay in our apartment (at least until Sep. 2021). My e-mail address is: PipStuart@GMail.Com where I should be able to be reached regarding this and any other pertinent matter. Maybe Doug C. is discriminating against me because I am Disabled. Maybe he and the Police are believing lies about me, being told by other tenants, without any of them having concrete proof. I presently do not have a working car, nor do I have the money which would be needed to find a new place to live before Oct. 19th, so please help me promptly, if you can.

Thank you very much! Sincerely,  -Pip  P.S. You could also try texting me at (920)636-6271 to arrange a time to call, if that would be preferable to e-mail.
