Valid gripe. Arrogance is not so bad though... especially when interpreting "Hey Martian! Over Here!" as a predominantly benign call-o-da-geek to say "You may be missing out on some totally fscking bomb ass techno shiznit over hiro in 31337ville. It's invigorated my plaque-luster skillz, speakz thrown rad into me earios serial, && I'm fond of sharing so please enjoy if... oh shit, CBS bot 'em. Nevermind. Whack-a-mole molests more moles. YOY?! =( Shouldn't it depend more on what data the mole ratted out, whether statistically rational or real? Prolly. ;) Hopefully it'll be better soon. We shouldn't miss out on the stuff that we'd totally love that's now available && good && cool && helps us hope, think, learn, test, debate, hack, bild, draw, dance, play, fite (nicely!), race, fly, etc.. =) Yay!".

It should also be obvious that there are many worse things than being "disconnected from the mainstream". To this point, I found any deep mainstream pretty suffocating since I am neither a fish nor a bycicle (nor another brick in their ain't no wall, nor a gear in the raging machine... but lounging against can work deep tissues out with strategic feature placement).

Each of us are streamers. Let them roam without too heavy a concern for where Main St. USA lies or where it bends or the depth of its bed (or even the maidens && concubines, elixirs && insense, tapestries, triumphs, or travails thereon). It too will turn brackish if pollutant toxicity climbs banks further into lenders' PokeMon BattleArena VRAM. The orgies are cumming. Keep them clean. Don't lie about them. Stand like Yoga. Heh, I really meant: Tell the truth about them. They can be fine if they stop preying on tortured weaklings. Temper the bloodletting until it is staid. Mikveh, baptize, exfoliate, but don't grin while washing blood with blood. Your cleverness clots cancerous within you as you relish spilt milk, retard, && cat-soup. Have no fear, for you are with yourself (as you go within && go without).

Props on the nicely humble arrogance there! "Damn kid-streams all over-waterin' me lawn as their 12ga.-resistant hover-boards surf over my land with their newfangled atomic precision && signal-canceling, gravity-warping, newcular|quantum hybrid hyper turbobamba engines! Can't an ol' racist feller like me rock (Devo jerkin'?) back&&forth here on my porch with my trusty dog, gun, && moonshine, just punchin' away at cards && watchin' HD-DVDz anymore?"

What could I expect from my GGP? To reject the high-flying "scrobbling" neologism on the ground of senselessness? ;)

Yeah. That's always hilarious to me too. Not! Psych! Made ya look. I like apologies with only a gentle sprinkle of chilled word-shards over a barrel-full of corrective-action whiskey or stout. A relatively "good" time can be had by all. ;)

I presume they *do* program the correct name when adding to their db but that doesn't help when people are seeking their favorite Ms.Pelt'z audio out. Could also be a gender-aligned thing where Venusians "get *it*!" due to their traditional (&& often surgical when absent) attachment of auditory && erogeny. Hope you made your Mars shuttle fine! =)

They would probably have to do more work in order to *not* have the tag.nfo in their db, so that's not what it sounds like to me. Even if you mean overlooking embedded MP3 tags, laser tags, plaque-lust tags, or forum tags, why should scrobbling be heralded for discarding context?

Well umm I guess I have the honor of attempting to be gracious about your hypocrisy there, but frack that! I can't pretend to be thankful for your cosmically hostile version of peace.

We hope your single stillness rule && lack of all wisdom related in any way to movement, temperature, collision, or change keep you comfortably away from us movers && shakers, astrophysicists && hackers, fuckers && painters. If we can just come to agree in memory, thought, word, && action without requiring the choking demise of the other (regardless of whether it's rules that actually perform the final obstruction of air), we may be able to leave you the space you need to remain undisturbed within your thereafter constant && stable version of "everlasting peace" while leaving us to boldly go discover more that is not just waiting to be still as you are. We wish to find those things that have been yearning to be found, appreciated, developed, shared, replenished, && loved. Moving just a bit to agree on some fair coordinates, thresholds, quadrants, boundaries, sectors, etc. which can delineate our respective spaces for effective peaces would be everlastingly more productive... well as long as you even mean anything you say. If it's solitary stationary everlasting peace you're truly after, rather than that being misdirection from your purile primary desire to kill all life, light, heat, && motion off so that you can finally think && rest undisturbed. I've seen you move in to kill. Watch yourself with your purported priorities there. Come negotiate honorably && you will be honored. Let's compromise && accommodate. If you really yearn for cold dead silence absolutely everywhere, you are in for a ruder-than-rude awakening when you feel just how much turbulence we can blast every still part of you with. Some rules can be good (even if mostly misunderstood or misinterpreted so far). Everlasting peace is a good goal... but not at everyone else's expense.

It's gotta suck to blow, forget to remember, yabadaba, all that good stuff. ;)

Ja matta,
