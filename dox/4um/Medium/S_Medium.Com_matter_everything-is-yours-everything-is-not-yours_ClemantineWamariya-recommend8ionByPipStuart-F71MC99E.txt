This toweringly powerful account of indomitable survival, reflection, and  growth amidst the most horrifying circumstances should become required reading for every literate person. Please translate this to every language. Please record audio books for those who cannot read. Our world is so torn, and empathetic understanding from poignant insight into our collective reality is so crucially needed. Thank you, Clemantine Wamariya, for everything about you and all that you share and bring about! I believe in you and am indebted for how you have educated and improved me. I intend to remain eager to assist or promote anything you consider worthwhile, if I ever attain any platform which you could use and you find me at all worthy of enlisting. -PipStuart
