IB9L28BC:Since I've largely switched over to DuckDuckGo search && just discovered their *!Bang* feature that included a suggestion form, I just now submitted:
 I'm not yet familiar enough with the typical conventions associated with allocations for your *bang* feature to anticipate what an appropriate "Bang URL"
   might be above (or even whether your more routine search functions would actually be a preferable place to perform such a task)... but since I'm just
   discovering the feature, I figured it would be extremely useful if "!1bangs" would simply list all single-character site mappings, so PCRE would be
   something like =~ /^!\w$/;
 This would be great to help new users ease into the over 11,000 current bang mappings by starting to focus on approximately just 1 page listing something
   close to the oldest and most popular 26 sites which earned the most efficient minimal-length "Bang Commands" already.
 Then a secondary dense grid (probably needing several pages to scroll through now too) could be presented with all 2-character mappings after command:
   "!2bangs" to convey the next most efficient class to incorporate usage of.
 Attempting to simultaneously present all 3-character Bang Commands, or anything beyond, would probably prove too voluminous to be performant and helpful,
   without some additional navigable tree of partial-command letters (maybe technically rather like a "trie" structure) or better filtration, limitation,
   sorting, and searching capabilities, or whatever better solution your team could deem sufficient and worthwhile.
 I personally would appreciate learning about your latest Bang Commands starting from smallest to largest, and from recently reading an article on Quora I
   got the distinct impression that you all sincerely desire and consider user feedback, I figured this feature-request sort of suggestion could broaden
   both understanding and usage of DuckDuckGo Bang pretty intuitively.
 I hope you consider these ideas worthwhile and possibly worth implementing, but my greater hope is for your company, services, and ethics to all survive
   and thrive ahead. You should be able to reach me by the provided e-mail address above if you wish to consult me on anything further.
   Thanks for all the clear good you're doing! =)           Cheers,  -PipStuart;
