Umm, I think Robert Hacker (my AEPi ZT little-bro, "Spicoli") rode around UCI on his decked-out bumble-striped beach-cruiser... && Sasha Strauss (my big-BRO, "SandraD") romped his black && goldenrod new Xterra for Anteater Cheers! ... so what can a middle "Pip" like me do but be borne beautifully between honey-sweet new GUI Gugl Buzz-iness to2toodlu? I can't imagine becoming less than perma-proud to be a Pi!

=<)3  <-- Behold, my new hybrid "Pir8-loving-countenance" emoticon with my typical =) smiley && <3 heart of true love synch0p8d or c0l8d to form a bit of mustachio (handle-barz || Black FrancisManChu Pixie) && curly fuzzy beard trailin' below me joyful grin... arrr maybe cleft shaven booty-chin if y'aint savvy wit' noodly-appendages a'protrudin' ahead ov'ya? I guess me interpret8n is more of a guideline. ;p

May Everyone's Sabbath Be Their Best Yet!

Love,
