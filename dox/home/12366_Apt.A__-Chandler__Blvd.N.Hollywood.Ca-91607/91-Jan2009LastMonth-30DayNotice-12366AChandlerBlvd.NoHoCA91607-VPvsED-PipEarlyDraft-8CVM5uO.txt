Su:Re: air conditioning and heating service

Hi Edi && David,

Please consider New Year's our 30-day notice that Vee && I intend to vacate. We've tried to defend against too many threats from too many directions while living here. Now that we've cleaned out most of the riff-raff, we're still unable to live comfortably on your property... && we're rather tragically also debating whether we can even continue on living or being together after stresses here has dealt such intolerable damage to each of us. That last part is probably of no consequence to you; I mention it merely to make the point that you (Edi) have definitely hurt us more than you've helped. You've been unreliable, especially when we've needed working plumbing, reliable scheduling, prompt information, even remembering the exchange && resolution of our most recent dialog.

*notz* mayb mention no invoice for Dutton costs if done by George the "plumb" who arrives in a sedan, leaves before even Edi thought he would, has no tools, asks for a hanger (which he breaks), can't be reached to agree on scheduled appointment date or time that ever corresponds to his availability (in addition to berating me as a child because I was unwilling to have him "fix" our non-critical problems when he showed up unexpectedly after remaining unwilling to schedule any appointment... even refusing to schedule *another* time then && there while we stood). Crazy rude && loud. Incredible! This is a non-plumber. He never fixed a single issue && Vee saw
