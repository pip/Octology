Su:Re: air conditioning and heating service

Hello Edi && David (... && Goodbye too ;) ),

We intend to conclude our tenancy with you by the end of January. This is our 30-day notice. We want an invoice for what plumbing would have cost you in addition our deposit refunded properly (according to California tenant laws). You saw through minimal repairs (if any) to everything that broke, have deceived, denied, && dawdled many times more than us. This is untenable. We must leave.

Salutations,
-Pip && Vee (&& kitties)

P.S. Maybe it'd be better for the next tenants (if you find some) for you to have a "plumber" who has a *truck* && *tools* who can *agree* to schedule a *time* to show up && ever *fix* anything at all. Follow that lead for the "electrician" (i.e., shouldn't deny disturbing electrocution events causing a tenant, after being asked to demonstrate the cause for concern, to lose finger-sensation *in his presence*!), a "dishwasher repair person" who stays long enough to report successful repair, an "air-filter cleaner" who knows our phone numbers, e-mail address, unit number, or *names*, etc.. Your unresponsiveness regarding our plea for assistance in changing locks through the housing authority has led to further property theft && damage. You claim we failed but you've failed much worse under scrutiny. Please improve for both your next tenants' sake && your own! Shalom.
