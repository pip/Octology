# K1EL6Noi:Oni-MediaPlyrz-ai.apt crE8d by PipStuart <Pip@CPAN.Org> to log the apt installed long list of audio && video players I've installed to try out;
# many of below are probably pretty polished && excellent to add to my setup in addition to MPlayer, gst123, xine, qmmp, && xmms2 I've already been using;
# also there's SMPlayer, VLC, MPV, APlay, ALSAPlayer, MikMod, && maybe a couple others I'm forgetting now which I have also used already && am good using;
# 2du:maybe run `acs media|gi player` to find any others that don't have audio or video in their descriptions, then just go through the list && rank them;
# P.S. the 3 passwords I needed to setup for Icecast2 were all Icy2Cast for now, but maybe should be made much stronger l8r,if I start using it to stream;
