------------------------------------------------------------------------
36GB  WSCSI  IBM      DDYS-T36950N          S1   /dev/sda   Gen:/c/
  Had boot sector (MBR) lilo choosing to boot Gen GNU/Linux off Quantum
    or Win95 from self.  Probably only one partition, all vfat.
18GB  WSCSI  Quantum  QM318000TD-SW         S3   /dev/sdb1  Gen:/boot
  Wouldn't boot alone. =(  Maybe need more       /dev/sdb2  Gen:/
    lilo attention to load MBR with good         /dev/sdb3  Gen:/home
    boot files.  Don't forget SCSI termination!  /dev/sdb4  Gen:sw
 4GB  WSCSI  Seagate  ST34573W              S5   /dev/sdc
  Bootable fresh Win2k partition.  Maybe secondary 1GB partition for
    making cd backups... which is useless now that DVD's are burnable.
    May use this drive with my Adaptec 29160 controller to mk Mike's
    broken Dell bootable again so that we can at least recover his music.
