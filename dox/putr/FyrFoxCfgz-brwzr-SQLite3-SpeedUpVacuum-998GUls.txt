on Unix, anyway. Exit Firefox, then do: for i in ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/*.sqlite; do sqlite3 $i "vacuum;" ; done
FF3.x does everything in sqlite. Some of the tables fill with crap 'cos deleted rows are marked "deleted" rather than actually being deleted and compacted.
I hope future versions will run a vacuum automatically every now and then. On this Ubuntu 9.04 box I had to apt-get install sqlite3.
