# FCELBJ42: Earlier this year, I installed a fresh i386 Ubuntu 15.04 to Taki (my Sony Vaio VGN-SZ240P) in preparation to gift her to Angie. I basically just
#   created user accounts for immediate family and made minimal changes to my own account. The changes I can discern are:
#     0. changed desktop background to solid blue
#     1. removed OpenOffice icons from left bar
#     2. added GnomeTerminal and arranged other left bar icons similar to Chun (my Fujitsu LifeBook T1010)
# Today (Mon Dec 14 2015) I began the dist-upgrade to 15.10 Wily Werewolf. I don't think I installed any additional packages before, so everything should still
#   remain pretty standard defaults. This document should be used to log all significant changes I make to customize the system to resemble Chun thoroughly.
# Basically any `agi`,`pmei`,vim (/etc|~)/*,rsync,etc. should append with a d8 stamp here to enable me to exhaust everything needed for a complete rebuild.
#plan:0. make TstTester user to reconstruct exact changes I already made before (&& reset Angie's first login help dialog)
#     1. reformat top bar clock
#     2. apt-get install indicator-multiload (&& config palette for preferred colors)
#     3. mv $HOME directories && vi ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs
#     4. apt-get install ccsm zsh vim w3m most less                ... (core environment)
#     5. setup Compiz && workspaces 4x2
#     6. RsynCore
#     7. agi gnome-tweak-tool or whatever to make CapsLock altern8 Control key like Chun (&& Ken?)
#     8. agi scrot xclip gpm                                       ... (main interaction utils)
#     9. agi aumix gst123 mpg123 mpg321 flac vorbis cdparanoia vlc ... (audio|video stuff)
#     A. agi dict* p47 rrootage                                    ... (reference && games)
# FCELIKE8:What I'm actually doing: (`sudo bash` is assumed before almost any of this)
      0. deluser (ang|ann|dot|ros|tim) since they aren't computing like I do anytime soon
      1. login to ang on Chun to compare && see what exactly I changed already, so I right-clicked to choose "Unlock from Launcher" on LibreOffice
         (Writer|Calc|Impress) && Amazon, moved Files from top below Search to bottom below "System Settings", added Terminal at top where Files was, && added
         "Software Updater" just beneath FireFox && above "Ubuntu Software Center". In Appearance click upper-right drop-down from Wallpapers down to third
         option "Colors & Gradients", then first left-most icon is Solid. For some reason, I can't query what Aku's actual RGB hex color is but dark blue.
         For Aku "Launcher icon size" slider over to 64. Hopefully that is all I changed from the default 15.04 install8ion for Taki.
# Note:Some stuff won't be applicable2both Chun&&Taki like only Chun has tablet functionality so also has Onboard && "Calibrate Touchscreen" in Launcher.
      2. Now back to just basic Taki reconfigur8ion, in Appearance > Behavior checking "Enable workspaces" like Chun has. This brought up new
         "Workspace Switcher" Launcher icon below Files but I'm swapping those to put it just above && below "System Settings". Chun is different in that her
         tablet needz the switcher more so it's beneath Onboard && above "Software Updater" to stay more prominent.
      3. "Text Entry" unchecking bottom-left "Show current input source in the menu bar"
      4. "Time & Date" > Clock checking to show Weekday, "Date and month", Year, "24-hour time", Seconds, && "Time in auto-detected location" && in
         "Universal Access" > Seeing > "Large Text" switched to On for Aku.
      5. Then add Terminal at top of Launcher just below Search
# Note:I might also need to configure Search to not include online results normally since I don't want the ads.
      6. `apt-get update`, `apt-get install indicator-multiload` then Search for "System Load Indicator" to start it up in the menu bar. Then right-click it
         && Preferences to check all on except "Swap Space" with "System monitor width" changed from 40 to 65 && "Built-in schemes" drop-down to Traditional.
         For Aku width 127 pixelz && upd8 interval 255ms.
      7. `apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool` then Search 'Tweak Tool', pick Typing > "Caps Lock key behavior" from top-most drop-down option of Disabled down 3
         to "Make Caps Lock an additional Ctrl". Aku doesn't need this 4 HHKB, but Ken does. Try to front-load all graphical configur8ion && lern2autom8 l8r.
      8. `apt-get install compiz-plugins
                        # compiz-plugins-default # this one was already current
                          compiz-plugins-main
                          compiz-plugins-main-default
                          compiz-plugins-extra`
         `apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager` thN `ccsm` then General > "General Options" > "Desktop Size" > 4x2 to setup workspacez graphically.
           Also Search   "CompizConfig Settings Manager" to drag icon just beneath "System Settings".
         This change didn't work on Taki right away. Maybe she has such poor acceler8ion that Compiz is hardly in control versus 2D Unity?
           Taki might also need to toggle her hardware Stamina versus Speed switch before boot to change between Intel && nVidia graphicz for driver support?
           It did not work right away on Ryu setting up Aku's new drive either.
         There might be other good Compiz stuff to adjust for Aku to have better rendering than Taki, so include notez here to keep up with modific8ionz.
      9. `apt-get install openssh-server` then rsync /etc/hosts && `vi /etc/hosts`4local so further configur8ion can be done remotely (&& autom8d better?)
# Note: Aku's new drive is being setup in Ryu so use Ryu's 8.7 IP for now, then remember to upd8 to .15 before enclosure (since it can collide with either).
#   This is tedious because I want to temporarily supplant ~/.ssh/known_hosts:6 for ryu with new fingerprint && restore original after drive is no longer
#     docked, but this issue will arise ongoingly with Aku while sometimez booting off this Xternal drive too unless I can set their keyz to the originalz.
#     Taki's is actually changing permanently for her with the new install so `ssh-keygen -f "/home/pip/.ssh/known_hosts" -R takiw` is good to remove old.
#   Maybe just syncing Aku's original ~/.ssh/id_rsa(.pub)? over new drive's versionz will let them stay matched up with MAC IP alloc8ion && hosts?
#     Or syncing some combin8ion of /etc/ssh/ sshd entries (as a final step before installing in enclosure?) will make the new drive ready to be a new Aku?
#   Just remembered I might have changed PermitRootLogin to yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config also. Not sure how that differs from without-password on new drive.
#   Probably best to just keep using keygen to delete after every switch. Conceptually weird to think of new Aku drive needing to refer to original with
#     common hostname so rsync just via IP (or hosts entry "AkuOrig" then polluting known after revert) but then to take over that IP with its MAC bound to
#     earlier remote IP && known entries then identifying self. Be really careful if U `ssRyu` while his host is new Aku (as it will resemble local shellz);
      A. `echo "net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf` && `sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=0` to enable pingb right away
      B. `mv Desktop .dsktp`,`rmdir Templates`,`mv Public .pub`,`mv Downloads .dl`,`mv Documents dox`,`mv Pictures gfx`,`mv Music muz`,`mv Videos mvz`,
         `rm examples.desktop`,`vi .config/user-dirs.dirs` && edit to reflect changez (with Templates just in ~ as "$HOME/") or just rsync the dirs file over
# maybe go thru .bashrc && .zshrc && /(usr/(local/)?)?bin/ for Aku's core && peripheral exeQtablez to agi on new installz B4 RsynCore or chsh are ready2run
# core: vim zsh w3m gpm git most xclip scrot wmctrl screen tmux Eterm aterm rxvt-unicode-256color xvt evilvte lxterminal sakura pterm source-highlight
#   RsynCore.ls then `chsh /bin/zsh`? Above should also try `agi rxvt terminology terminology-data` for more terminal altern8ives.
# inSNTal: dictd dict-foldoc dict-gcide dict-jargon dict-moby-thesaurus dict-vera dict-bouvier dict-devil dict-elements dict-wn dictfmt dict
#   gst123 mpg123 mpg321 mikmod mplayer youtube-dl ctorrent irssi joy2key parsec47 rrootage fbset dclock mysql-server mysql-client mesa-utils (4 glxgears)
#   cdparanoia lame ImageMagick (4 `identify` && `convert` Utilz)
#     then a lot of `pmei` will probably be needed to bring PerlModulez up to be able to run g3 or just d8 (which should maybe happen before RsynCore)
      C. `apt-get install vim zsh w3m gpm git most xclip scrot screen tmux Eterm aterm rxvt-unicode-256color xvt evilvte lxterminal sakura pterm source-hi...`
#        also Taki had mutt but that had dialogz about e-mail transport && host domain I'd rather avoid until genuinely needed, so I've removed it
# maybe better to just include lib/Time in Rsyn(Core|Full).ls so stepz D, E, && F can be skipped below so I've added that to those ~/dox/putr/ filez
      D. `perl -MCPAN -e "install Time::DayOfWeek"` then accepting auto-configur8ion to handle setting up ~/.cpan/ && installing correctly
      E. `perl -MCPAN -e "install Time::DaysInMonth"` which should be enough to allow `d8` in the .bashrc PS1 prompt to execute
      F. `perl -MCPAN -e "install Time::PT"` so `lsd8` && `l` alias can wrap ls beautifully  # rsync BlO took afew hourz so mAB rm mvz && some dox from Core.ls
      G. rsyncd RsynCore.ls (orig new terminal with bash login after complained of lacking Time/Day(OfWeek|sInMonth).pm so hopefully full pMei those first)
      H. `zsh` seemz to start without errorz so try `chs -s /bin/zsh` to upd8 login shell but still probably need to change in GnomTerm config also to work?
# might need or want to `cho pip:pip ~/.(bash_history|viminfo|dbus|cpan)` then presumably rsync ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal can setup GT similarly... but it
#   doesn't work && new term windowz still are starting with bash instead of zsh && checking menu Edit > Preferences > Profiles doesn't show them so...
#   try to change /etc/ssh/sshd_config to PermitRootLogin yes then `passwd root` for recovery option into .bashrc resembling /etc/skel hopefully.
      I. `v /etc/ssh/sshd_config` then setting passwd root to same as pip. Then testing ssh in to pip@Taki from Aku started fine with zsh but root@ was denied.
# Now might be a slightly safe time to try a reboot && see if GT profilez or local zsh default login have upd8d.
      J. reboot && both sshd && presumably GConf have restarted so now Aku can `ssh root@TakiW` && new local GT stRtz zsh but the only Profile is still Unnamed
# I don't know where else all the GT config d8a could be stored if not ~/.gconf/apps/ && I've looked thru ~/.* so it might be /etc or /var or something?
      K. `rm ~/.profile` just to tidy up since bash should have taken a backseat to zsh then `agi gconf-editor` to see if that enablez copied profilez
# gconf-editor can now see the Profiles but GT can't so I'm going to try to rm Unnamed && crE8 Default d8ok && the othr namz I use then try rsync over again.
#   It must be getting stored elsewhere because now there's the directories && editor seeing unused d8a while GT has its own same named versionz.
# gconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles... --type=float 0.50 can be used to upd8 from CLI. Ok, another reboot restored GT's hollow copied profilez
#   which still have the same names but none of the remaining file contentz. Duplic8z are being stored somewhere I can't find yet! Probably found it...
#   with OMG `gsettings get org.gnome.Terminal.ProfilesList list` && s/list$/default/ &&
#   gsettings set org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profile:/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:UUID/ KEY VALUE  # s/set/list-keys/ or s/-keys/-recursively/

# It seemz dconf mainly uses '-' dash in keys instead of gconf '_' underscores && doesn't have XML bloat with nested misalignment. How to stop using legacy?
# Maybe I could make my own compact .gtrc which can gener8 set commandz for [dg](conf|settings) but I'd rather just switch to using gconf && cp existing.
# gconftool-2 -a "/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/(Default|Profile[1-4])" dumpz similar to list-recursively after above UUID/ so just sort, match, regex keyz
#   && call commandz with appropriate quoting for valuez. Apparently gconf support has been phasing out since last year or before, even if dconf is "legacy".
# Forget autom8ing all that right now.
      L. Manually configure GnomTerm profilez to resemble either Akuma or Taki as approprE8 && just expect future config with gsettings instead of gconf.
# agi dictz && muz stuff,pmei Curses(::Simp)? for d8ok,catch new Aku up with Taki(wi him stuck on step 9 above w8ing 4 /etc/hosts Bcuz I'm wary of keygen).

#   relearn how to scale up all font sizes AgN. `lsd8` needz Time::PT which needz `pmei Math::BaseCnv`.
      N. `agi libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev` && `pmei Curses` && `pmei Curses::Simp`
      O. `agi dict dict-bouvier dict-devil dict-elements dict-foldoc dict-gcide dict-jargon dict-moby-thesaurus dict-vera dict-wn dictd dictfmt dictzip`
      P. `agi gst123 mpg123 mpg321 mikmod irssi mplayer youtube-dl ctorrent joy2key parsec47 rrootage fbset dclock mysql-server mysql-client mesa-utils`
      Q. `agi cdparanoia lame imagemagick irssi-scripts imagemagick-doc` # should figure out all additional useful packages I should get here with these
# mk sure IO::Tty (&& Expect) enable g3, setup ccsm zoom hotkeyz, do all SDL stuff for 8trm then Tk for diag
      R. G19LEuxS redid Taki's ccsm General Desktop size to 4x2 after hardware switched to speed and enabled Accessibility Negative plugin. Added to
         "Enhanced Zoom Desktop" "Zoom In/Out" mappings ZIButn <Super>Button5, ZIKeey <Super>Up, ZOButn <Super>Button4, ZOKeey <Super>Down. Tried to
         enable "Desktop Cube" && disable "Desktop Wall" but it errored out && removed ccsm from Launcher && sent Canonical bug report. Re-enabling Wall
         removed most Launcher icons so I'm going to try to reboot && reconstruct them. Actually rebooting after just enabling Cube, reconstructing icons,
         then enabling "Rotate Cube" while disabling "Rotate to Face 1 with Window" binding of <Shift><Super>Home which maybe somehow collided with
         "Viewport Switcher" (even though I don't see a matching binding there) seems to have enabled Cube for Taki now too. # need2redo Zoom?
      S. `v /etc/default/grub` to comment out HIDDEN_TIMEOUT lines, change normal TIMEOUT from 10 to 8, && change CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="" no "quiet splash"
          && ran `update-grub` && rebooted;
# want to agi chromium-browser to have altern8 browser like Chun but wants to install libsdl-image1.2 along with so I'd rather just get all SDL first 2gether;
      T. `pmei IO::Tty` said needs YAML for persistent st8 && could get CPAN 2.10 also so I'm going to pmei those too before Expect. CPAN likes to use
         Expect itself for its own shell tests so better to do Expect first next time. Those enable g3 to run (if load isn't too high?);
      U. `agi libsdl1.2debian libsdl1.2-dev libsdl1.2-dbg libsdl-console libsdl-console-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-5 libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-doc

         enabled Aku, Ryu, && Ken to have larger text system-wide, but maybe unity-tweak-tool > Appearance > Fonts > "Text scaling factor" is an altern8 way;
# Remember F2 should bring up Taki's BIOS instead of Delete. BIOS seems to randomly just power-down when navig8ing menus. Saving changes to sparse options

#   to be dying with all sorts of dmesg DRDY ERR && device errors. Taki is so old && runs hot with heavy load. She's on her last leg. I want her to live more;
# Ctrl-Alt-Esc at boot picks among bootable devices but selecting 'Internal Optical Drive' still fails to boot 15.04 DVD. Bleh. F8 might go to Advanced Mode;
# Remember that setting up another fresh install similar to above but for one of my 2TB desktop drives should manually setup at least a 1GB sda1 /boot ext2
#   partition before allowing the remainder of the drive to be LVM root && swap (since old default 228MB /boot barely has space for any fallback kernels);
