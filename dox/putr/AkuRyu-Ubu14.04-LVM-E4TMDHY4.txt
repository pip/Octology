E4LMG2P8:Monday
On Aku:
May need software-properties tool or pkg-mngr after dist-upgrade to 14.04LTS to re-enable 3rd-party sources.
Also need to learn how to properly clone and mount drives since plain dd seems not to work.
May also need to agi xfsprogs to be able to read old Gentoo drives since installer auto-removed.
After fresh 14.04 install to Ryu, shutdown hung and needed manual reboot. Then added terminal to sidebar, launched, `sudo bash`, `apt-get update`,
  `apt-get upgrade` (got about a dozen new packages), then main menu shutdown restart succeeded.

E4MMLINK:Tuesday
Ryu new drive: zipped snapshot of ~pip then started as root big `rsync -av root@192.168.8.15:/home/pip/\[b-m\]\* .` to backup main Aku files took a little
  over 4 hours to complete.

E4NMCATS:Wednesday
Since using dd to attempt to duplicate whole original Aku 2TB Samsung sda drive over to new 2TB Seagate sdb seems to have introduced errors when trying to
  boot and has duplicated the LVM PV UUID creating a conflict, I decided to try to start over on a fresh new drive.
After running `sfdisk -d /dev/sda > /home/pip/dox/putr/Aku/Aku_-sda-LVM-pRtitNz-E4MMEtFR.txt` I copied over to sdb E4NMCklZ.txt and edited a to b.
Then reran `sfdisk /dev/sdb < $sdbf` and `fdisk -l` shows partition parity. Now it looks like I can run `lvm pvscan` to see just sda5 PV in my default
  'ubuntu' VG. Then `lvm pvcreate /dev/sdb5` makes the new PV and another pvscan shows both sda5 and sdb5 with only a in the VG. Then `lvm vgextend ubuntu
  /dev/sdb5` adds b to the VG. Another scan confirms. Then I should be able to run `nice -n 16 lvm lvconvert -m1 /dev/ubuntu/root` to start huge sync process.
  Once complete, should be able to `lvm vgreduce ubuntu /dev/sdb5` and scan to confirm, then `lvm pvremove /dev/sdb5` and scan again then just need to figure
  out best way to setup bootable grub on sdb1.

E4NMDROP
Since sda1 and sdb1 are relatively normal partitions, `dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1` completed quickly and should at least sync /boot file data properly, even
  if I'll probably later need to boot from an Ubuntu LiveCD to update-grub from to finally load the disk's boot sector. Should probably research further about
  whether I'll need to somehow reverse the lvconvert mirroring config before safely vgreduce and pvremove. It looks like `lvm lvconvert --splitmirrors ...`
  with some appropriate option is what I'm looking for. Actually, it's looking like splitmirrors needs a name by which to create a new logical volume. Maybe I
  should be using pvmove instead of live RAID1 mirroring? Nevermind that. pvmove actually does move from one disk to another so I do really want mirroring at
  least until drives are synchronized. Still may need some lvconvert to stop mirroring before removal. So maybe I will need to `lvm lvconvert --splitmirrors 1
  -n root-o ubuntu/root /dev/sdb5` then `lvm lvs -a -o+devices` to see 2 separated root volumes then `lvm lvchange -an ubuntu/root-o` to make other volume
  inactive. Then might need `vgsplit ubuntu ubuntu-o /dev/sdb5` then lvs should show 2 VGs with ubuntu just on /dev/sda5 and ubuntu-o just on /dev/sdb5. Maybe
  splitting the separate VG off is not what I want because powering down the drive and rebooting might make Aku upset if he's expecting the VG that is no
  longer there.

E4OM9KUL:Thursday
It looks like my lvconvert -m1 mirror command is super slow, finishing about 1% per hour so it'll probably take over 4 days to complete!
Although Chun was able to `pmei Curses` with new Perl 5.18 (replacing 5.14), `pmei CPAN` fails, as well as Module::Build, Alien::SDL, && SDL. ckm8 is broken &&
  I'm frustrated. `pmei CPAN` from v.2.00 to v.2.05 also failed (similarly to Chun) on Aku. I'm going to try to power down Ryu, swap new Seagate with old
  Samsung drive, blast fans, && swap new Asus sound card with old Creative. I'll try swapping in Aku's VaporX 5770 video card later, after long disk mirroring
  finishes and both disks prove bootable. So swapping disks worked fine but Asus sound produced errors so I put PCI Audigy back in bottom slot and tested it
  working fine there. I also tried moving nVidia card to lower slot but no video came up when booting so I moved it back to the upper PCI-E 16 slot and video
  came back up when booting. On Ryu started `sudo bash` to become root, then `rsync -av root@192.168.8.15:/home/pip/.lsrc .` and same for vimrc && zshrc then
  started ~/.inst/ && .bak. Doing simultaneous rsync slows Aku's lvconvert way down so probably better to just figure out how to mount LVM partitions directly
  from Ryu's eSATA dock for synchronizing ~/.arc/ instead of trying massively slow additional rsync over my LAN.

E4PMCCCC:Friday
Aku's sidebar contains: Terminal, FireFox, Google Chrome, Software Updater, Ubuntu Software Center, System Settings, CCSM, Workspace Switcher, Files, Floppy
  Disk. On Ryu, moved Files icon down above Floppy. Unlocked from Launcher LibreOffice Writer, Calc, && Impress as well as Amazon. Dragged Software Updater
  above Software Center. `apt-get install vim vim-doc zsh zsh-doc w3m most` Made System Settings > Appearance color match Aku with #020F1A and Behavior
  auto-hide Launcher && enable workspaces. In Look, switched wallpapers drop-down to colors & gradients && picked first solid color option. Moved Launcher
  Workspace Switcher icon above Files && below System Settings. Right-clicked En language indicator to pick 'text entry settings' then unchecked 'show current
  input source in the menu bar'. Right-clicked menu bar clock to pick 'time & date settings...' then under 'clock' tab checked to show weekday, date & month,
  year, 24-hour time, && seconds. Added Year to Aku's && Chun's clock displays too. Back on Ryu started new plain bash terminal && ran `zsh`. Ran `vim
  ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs` and changed to .Dsktp, .dl, .Tmpl8z, .pub, dox, muz, gfx, mvz like Aku. Moved Desktop, Downloads, Public, && Templates && removed
  Documents, Music, Pictures, && Videos. Moved examples.desktop to .xmplz.dsktp. Rebooted to see dirs changes take effect. Did `sudo chown pip:pip
  .bash_history` then ran `zsh` then `chsh pip`, entered password then entered '/usr/bin/zsh' then exited to test but term icon still started up plain bash.
  Ran `cd ~/.gconf/apps` then `rsync -av pip@192.168.8.15:.gconf/apps/g\* .` then rebooted to test. Seems good. `sz`, `agi indicator-multiload`. `x` then in
  Launcher apps started 'System Load Indicator'. Then right-clicked to Preferences and enabled mem, net, load, && hard disk. On Ryu, no sshd so I couldn't
  ssh in from Chun so I ran `sz` then `agi openssh-server` which pulled in a bunch of additional apparently needed packages. Hmm. ssh still doesn't work yet
  so I must need to enable it in some additional way. After unplugging new Ryu 14.04 drive && attempting again to boot from new drive that was used on Aku to
  dd copy 13.10 I let the boot process complete attempting to fix errors && then it could boot but the system seemed to reset to defaults && not allow
  configuration changes. I tried to aguu && it seemed to complete but I didn't attempt the dist-upgrade to 14.04. With the LVM partition seemingly fixed &&
  accessible again, I turned off the drive dock && rebooted Ryu off his new internal 14.04 drive then once up turned on the dock again && was able to mount
  /dev/ubuntu/root to /mnt/sdb5 && began the massive rsync -av into /home/pip/.arc so that I hopefully won't have to do it slower over my LAN. Note that my
  sda PV is in a separate VG titled 'ubuntu-vg'. After this rsync completes, I should probably repartition sdb && start a new mirror for Ryu. The problems are
  that dd made the new drive's PV UUID the same as Aku's original Samsung drive && the repaired errors apparently render it bootable but only in some default
  unchangeable state so better to just start it over with a fresh partition && pvcreate after ~/.arc is sync'd off of it. I'm not sure yet whether it's a
  better idea to restart that drive with a fresh install from the 14.04 LiveCD or to LVM mirror Ryu's sda which might be harder to make it a bootable backup.
  Either way, it's good to have the vast majority of Aku's ~ sync'd to his own mirror && on Chun && new Ryu (with .arc too) all updated to 14.04. I do still
  need to learn more about whether splitmirrors will be necessary for Aku's new Seagate drive && how to update-grub on it to make it a fully bootable backup.
  Eventually running a RAID1 mirror in Aku all the time seems like a good idea. Initiating Aku's mirror was done mainly following
  HTTP://Linux.M2OSW.Com/creating-drive-mirror-lvm-including-exact-partition-cloning which doesn't yet explain splitting the mirror or making the new disk
  bootable. I tseems like it might be a good idea to vgrename each of my disks that won't be dedicated mirrors separately to ease later mounting &&
  synchronization.

E4QMA6wn:Sabbath
On Ryu, had to also run `sudo ufw allow 22` to let me ssh in from Chun but apparently the default still won't allow root login which I use for some
  system-level rsync commands so I still need to figure out how to allow that, even though it may pose a serious security risk. If my partitions weren't
  already using the entire disks, then using LVM to create stable snapshots to backup from would probably be a good idea as an alternative to having LVM
  perform the full LV partition mirroring. I could create a snapshot with 2GB available to grow to hold changes while backup is being copied with:
  `sudo lvcreate -L2G -s -n root-bak /dev/ubuntu-vg/root` then `sudo md /mnt/root-bak` && `sudo mount /dev/ubuntu-vg/root-bak /mnt/root-bak`.
E4QMI321:Sabbath
Ryu's rsync finished so I powered him down && unplugged his good new drive && rebooted off the 14.04 LiveCD && powered on the drive dock just after booting
  from the CD started (which was necessary since the bad dd 13.10 disk was still poorly bootable with earlier SATA detection than my ROM drive). Aku's
  mirroring is past 76% complete so I have just about 24 hours left to learn how to stop mirroring && make his cloned disk bootable before swapping it in with
  his new video card. Ryu's new fresh 14.04 install took less than half an hour. First boot brought up Software Updater so I got it up-to-date then changed
  the menubar clock && hid the language text entry indicator. Then moved Launcher Files icon down && unlocked 3 LibreOffice && Amazon icons. Then changed
  Settings > Appearance to #020F1A with right-click customize && wallpapers drop-down to Colors&Gradients then picking the first solid option. Then Launcher
  "soft" && dragging Software Updater icon above Software Center then "term" && putting Terminal above FireFox just below Launcher button. Then launched
  terminal to `sudo bash` then `apt-get update` then `apt-get upgrade` just got newer bash then `apt-get install vim vim-doc zsh zsh-doc w3m most
  indicator-multiload`. I should learn what's in vim-scripts later. Then `rsync -av pip@192.168.8.32:.config/user-dirs.dirs .config`, `exit`, `mv Desktop
  .Dsktp`, `mv Documents dox`, `mv Downloads .dl`, `mv examples.desktop .xmplz.dsktp`, `mv Music muz`, `mv Pictures gfx`, `mv Public .pub`, `mv Templates
  .Tmpl8z`, `mv Videos mvz`. `rsync -av 192.168.8.32:.lsrc .` && for .vimrc && .zshrc then bin then `sudo rsync -av root@192.168.8.32:/home/pip/lib .` since
  I think some files in there are owned by root. Getting lib perls took a minute so I reopened Appearance > Behavior to Auto-Hide Launcher && enable
  workspaces. Then moved Files icon below Workspace Switcher. Then `rsync -av 192.168.8.32:.gconf/apps/g\* .gconf/apps` then `exit` && reboot to test. Then
  term still brought up bare-bones bash but `zsh` looked good so `x`, `chsh pip`, enter password, enter /usr/bin/zsh, then opening PipsCkm8GnomTerm came up
  with zsh normally. Now this new Ryu setup is looking pretty comfortable && is just awaiting my larger ~ sync of .bak, dox, dvl, gfx, gmz, muz, mvz, .arc.
  `sudo du -sb /home/pip` returns 263,664,210 which isn't too huge && would probably shrink a lot if I'd just clean my old perls out of lib. I also launched
  System Load Indicator && set my preferences. All told took about an hour && a half to setup this fresh install. Nice! Maybe later I should
  `sudo vgrename ...` from default "ubuntu-vg" to "vg-Ryu1" or something similarly descriptive. I'm not sure why it's constantly hitting the disk like the
  installer did. I shut Ryu down for now but next time I boot him off that docked drive, I should probably `agi openssh-server` && `ufw allow 22`.

E4SMELLY:Monday
After following basic LVM mirroring directions on Aku by doing:
  `sfdisk /dev/sdb < pRtitNz.txt`
  `pvcreate /dev/sdb5`
  `vgextend ubuntu /dev/sdb5`
  `lvconvert -m1 /dev/ubuntu/root` taking 4+ days I'm now attempting to split the mirrors as both bootable.
  `lvconvert --splitmirrors 1 -n root-o ubuntu/root /dev/sdb5`
  `lvchange -an ubuntu/root-o` to make other root inactive
  `vgsplit ubuntu vgaku0 /dev/sdb5` then try
  `lvrename vgaku0/root-o vgaku0/root` then maybe
  `grub-install /dev/sdb` or `grub`, `root (hd1,0)`, `setup (hd1)`, `quit`
Tried just g-i first then powered down dock && `lvs -a -o+devices` shows many I/O errors. Before I try to reboot off just Samsung again, I think I should try
  to `vgreduce vgaku0 /dev/sdb5` but it failed with Volume group "vgaku0" not found so just trying reboot. Booting showed crazy video tearing on left display
  but then seemed to start off Samsung otherwise fine. Then powering down, unplugging Samsung && attempting just booting off docked Seagate failed with no
  dev mapper root error message so trying to repair off LiveCD now. Didn't know what to do yet. Need more research so rebooted off Samsung sda && with Seagate
  sdb back on in dock in inactive vgaku0 VG. Alternative to splitmirrors might be `lvconvert -m0 /dev/ubuntu/root /dev/sdb5`. I'm not yet sure even how to
  merge VG's && reactivate mirroring. At least I can reactivate the LV then mount sdb5 to rsync.
E4SMFsBq:Monday
I expect I could
  `lvremove vgaku0/root`
  `vgremove vgaku0`
  `vgextend ubuntu /dev/sdb5`
  `lvconvert -m1 /dev/ubuntu/root` to reestablish mirror but it'd probably take a long time even though sda5 && sdb5 are still almost entirely in sync. I just
  want to learn how to make the mirror so thorough that Aku can properly boot up off either disk. Remember that the PV disk in the command: `lvconvert -m0
  /dev/ubuntu/root /dev/sdb5` is the disk you want to remove when unmirroring. If crashing && uncontrolled rebooting becomes common, it might be better to
  create the mirror with `lvconvert -m1 --mirrorlog mirrored --alloc anywhere /dev/ubuntu/root` so that rebuilding the mirror won't require hours to complete.
  Note that if I want to partition a same sized drive, I can run: `sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sfdisk /dev/sdb`. I might also later want to mirror swap too with a
  command like: `lvconvert -m1 --mirrorlog mirrored --alloc anywhere ubuntu/swap_1 /dev/sdb5` after already setting up root similarly. For GRUB, I might need
  to `rm /boot/grub/device.map`, `grub-install --recheck /dev/sdb`, `update-grub2`. Trying Seagate again prints:
  Gave up waiting for root device.  Common problems:
   - Boot args (cat /proc/cmdline)
     - Check rootdelay= (did sys wait long enough?)
     - Check root= (did sys wait for right device?)
   - Missing modules (cat /proc/modules; ls /dev)
  ALERT!  /dev/mapper/ubuntu-root does not exist. Dropping to a shell!
E4SMHOPE:Monday
It might be feasible to run the 20 hour dd copy then boot off CD && run `pvchange --uuid /dev/sda5` with only the new drive powered on. I can't `vgreduce
  vgaku0 /dev/sdb5` because the PV is still in use as the only PV in the VG. I could `vgremove vgaku0` if I was sure I could get it back. I am able to
  `lvrename vgaku0/root vgaku0/root-o`, `vgmerge ubuntu vgaku0` to get sdb5 back in my ubuntu VG but still unsure how to reestablish the mirror from there.
  I created a new mirror of ubuntu/swap_1 then split as swap_1-o so that sda5 && sdb5 would be closer to identical.
Yay! It looks like I finally got it to work. I had just my ubuntu VG containing sda5 root && swap_1 LV's && also my split mirrors on sdb5 named root-o &&
  swap_1-o then I booted off my LiveCD && only powered on the Seagate in my drive dock (which then became sda). I picked Try Ubuntu && opened a terminal then
  did `sudo bash`, `lvremove ubuntu/root` && confirm then `lvremove ubuntu/swap_1` && confirm. Both of those were from the missing PV. Then `vgreduce
  --removemissing ubuntu`, `lvrename ubuntu/root-o ubuntu/root`, `lvrename ubuntu/swap_1-o ubuntu/swap_1` then rebooting just off the Seagate finally worked.
  I've tested successful boots off either disk now. Time to test upgrading video && sound cards. Yay! Samsung now external backup. R9 VaporX && Xonar installed
  && working. Ryu with old VaporX works too.
