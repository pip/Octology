F9CMAKDV:Sh: GalX-Samsung_Galaxy_S4-_SCH-I545_-F9CMAKDV.txt crE8d by Pip@CPAN.Org after attempting to run a GooglePlayStore system upd8 with almost no battery
life left && about 8 appz wanting to upd8. I had to tap the 'Stop' button but then entered OshKosh Public Library to get phone && Chun laptop online through
their open WiFi here && to start charging GalX (which I should rename after some fighting game character eventually). When the upd8 dialog was dismissed after
stopping progress, the top-menu option disappeared && I haven't yet been able to figure out how to get the upd8 option back up, so I might just have to wait
until more applic8ionz request upd8ing so that I can do the older onez that should still be available too?
