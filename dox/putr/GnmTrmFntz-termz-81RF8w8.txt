7489Ym5 - In searching for fast XOrg terminals that looked good, I messed with [axE]term and each are fast but look poopy so I tried to balance gnome-terminal
  to have good looking fonts that were fast enough not to annoy.  Maybe optimized nvidia drivers or a faster font server would help expand this list but
  stars are beside my favorites and plusses indicate ones that at least have one or two levels of resizeability:

            Artist
           *Artist Serif
            Artsie
            Asimov
            Bloks
            Bright
           *Cantor
            Cntdown
            Computer Alt
          +*Courier
            Escher
           *Eurotype
            Feynman
          + Fixed
            Gagarin

            Smooth
            Terminal
          +*Terminus
            Test
            Test Alt
            Thin

  I'd like to automate the generation of more good fonts from console utilities (`fpal` && FontForge?) when I find time.
81RF29q - I've installed a bunch of new fonts which hosed a lot of my previous `gnome-terminal` font settings in ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/
  so I poked around looking for good fonts for my 160x64 && 80x?? terms && discovered that almost all fonts render fast now.
