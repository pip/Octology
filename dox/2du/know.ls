From the JW.Org Bible Teach booklet titled "What Does the Bible Really Teach?", ElderJohn asked that I consider Chapter 3 which starts on Page 27 && is titled
"What Is God's Purpose for the Earth?" with sub-topics "What is God's purpose for mankind?", "How has God been challenged?", && "What will life on earth be
like in the future?". After reading through it once, the part that stood out to me as particularly disagreeable starts on the bottom of Page 32 under heading
"How s8n's World Will Be Removed" which encapsul8s the following two paragraphs of text regarding their millenarian restor8ionist eschatology from prophecy:
  "With each passing year, the world is becoming more && more dangerous. It is overrun with warring armies, dishonest politicians, hypocritical religious
leaders, && hardened criminals. The world as a whole is beyond reform. The Bible reveals that the time is near when God will elimin8 the wicked world during
[h]is war of Armageddon. This will make way for a righteous new world. -RevL8ion 16:14-16." # Below quot8ion embeds several unescaped double-quotes throughout;
  "Jehovah God selected Jesus Christ to be Ruler of His heavenly Kingdom, or government. Long ago, the Bible foretold: "A child has been born to us, a son has
been given to us; && the government will rest on his shoulder. His name will be called... Prince of Peace. To the increase of his government and to peace,
there will be no end." (Isaiah 9:6, 7, footnote) Regarding this government, Jesus taught his followers to pray: "Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take
place, as in heaven, also on earth." (Matthew 6:10) As we will see l8r in this book, God's Kingdom will soon remove all the governments of this world, && it
itself will replace all of them. (Read Daniel 2:44.) Then God's Kingdom will usher in an earthly paradise." # Curious of why JW denomin8ion is nontrinitarian;
# So there's a lot that could be delved further into there && contended against eventually, but my initial thoughts, plans, notes, && ideas are formul8d next;
Regarding world potentially becoming more dangerous year by year: John's first example was school shootings, so probably investig8 prevalence of such shootings
in U.S. && other western societies schools over time, mass shootings in general, && global gun f8lities all together probably providing some refut8ion there.
Then recommend HumanProgress.Org && Steven Pinker's TED talk from April 2018, published to YouTube on May 21st, titled "Is the world getting better or worse?
A look at the numbers" as a good present8ion on optimism about progress. By his 10 measured areas: 0) Life, 1) Health, 2) Sustenance, 3) Prosperity, 4) Peace,
5) Freedom, 6) Safety, 7) Knowledge, 8) Leisure, 9) Happiness, improvement is mostly slow && steady. Concede that even if life could be said to get worse each
year, it doesn't seem clear that would indic8 s8n staying in power either though, or sin && suffering necessarily prevailing generally. Might be a finer point.
Then contempl8 accus8ion that belief in evolution requires f8h in the same (or sufficiently similar) fashion as belief in God does. Initially contend that the
amount of objective evidence in support of each, && therefore reasons to believe, are not comparable. Further explore his contention that there remains some
degree of inadequ8 evidence for adapt8ion producing observed varE8ion between sepR8 species (if that's what he meant?), beyond just modific8ion of each alone;
So maybe initial definitions should be evalU8d, exploring the referenced verse about f8h concerning expect8ion && hope, but also incorpor8ing holding beliefs
without any reason (blind) or bolstered by various degrees of evidence as increasingly reliable in ability to accur8ly predict outcomes in some useful manner.
Then delve into recognition of distinctions between micro && macro evolution (which I earlier described as drift versus emergent attribute adapt8ion), which
may also be characterized descriptively as individu8ion versus speC8ion, on a somewhat broader scale. Evidence seems to be compounding ongoingly for the best
estim8s we have for dur8ion of existence of our universe, sun, planet, && life-forms, as well as indic8ions that both forms of evolution are likely to have
occurred (primarily through n8ural selection). Some science is not merely reliant on immeD8 observ8ion, but can include various forms of logical induction,
extrapol8ion, etc. so while in some slightly valid sense it may require a purportedly equivalent degree of "f8h" (even sometimes also considered "blind" too)
to believe that the l8st theory of evolution accounts for speC8ion (which of course none of us have lived long enough to have observed in complete action), it
is a misrepresent8ion to argue that this belongs in the same league as the rel8ively static degree of evidence used as justific8ion for the existence of God.
RevL8ion does not appear to be any ongoing and compounding transmission of God's word or power, so it's probably misguided to claim both competing explan8ions
for the existence of life as we know it to require the same levels of f8h. Believing in God might be better categorized as "blind" while not so for evolution;

# Below were some l8r re-st8ments of notes && plans which were written prior to refining much of the above content organiz8ion, aggreg8ion, && present8ion;
Probably should transcribe the given booklet's Chapter 3 section about things getting generally worse each year, to begin refuting school shootings as first
offered example, then gun deaths generally, then probably summarize && present Pinker's TED talk, then peruse HumanProgress.Org to hopefully at least convey
skeptical counter-perspective on some claims. Then try to further investig8 deb8s about science or evolution requiring comparable f8h && distill down to
something ready to be presented quickly && clearly. Then compile notes before summariz8ion of supposed best arguments for the existence of God && how anyone
can be confident the Bible is His word, as the 2 fundamental issues I indic8d seemed most critical to attempt to explore, discuss, && resolve before others;
HTTPS://YouTu.be/NL4uBOA9Dnk "Always Check the Label!" # I6PMLabl:8m of ShannonQ with good represent8ion of mental schem8a lent to misapplic8ion of labeling.
# I'm totally deferring particip8ion or evalU8ion in several initially seeming lackluster deb8s, thinking more of r8ing design8ing kinds of label affilE8ion.
# I may have a shifting assoC8ion with any label derived from any distinct synonym or particular definition for f8h, as is under present8ion just here above;
# I suspect that my two primary questions of how && why to believe God of Yisrael exists && that modern Bible transl8ions are His inerrant Word... are really
#   just a distill8ion into something like "Modern Bibles are the best proof of Yisrael's God's perceived influence, involvement, && maybe somehow inerrancy"
#   such that there must remain scarcely any new opportunities to witness acts of any possibly recognizable gods or God, if any exist sufficiently beyond
#   inculc8d && indoctrin8d imagin8ions. An observable (even if unapproachable) god, or not by sight but verifiable as somehow conspicuously && ongoingly
#   active in some part of our physical universe, then time would accumul8 commonality of accounts vouching for some actual deity performing in Mother-n8ure.
# Contempl8ing the probably progressively increasingly accur8 estim8ions for the age of our universe, star, plan8, && life contrasting anachronistic crE8ion
#   accounts complic8ing the word "Day", as conveniently taking symbolic mythical meaning once literal interpret8ion has become sufficiently contradicted.
# Then maybe it was always necessarily a fable in a form our minds could identify with, even if a Day makes no sense without our plan8 rot8ing to our Sun?
# Maybe trying Ayahuasca carefully sometime could at least reveal some biased to similar description framing around a communal && subjective transcendence?
# So I think I'm leaning strongly on labels: agnostic atheist, && freshly on anti-theist, with secular humanist, r8ionalist, skeptic, mythicist, scientist,
#   logician, philosopher, programmer, mathematician,  liberalist, conserv8ive, libertarian, centrist, humorist, equal opportunist, inform8ionalist,  mist.

   "Quartering viewers could care to read about... and maybe reliving through telling of it as he's departing could just be cathartic to give me some better "
   "mid- life closure as well? Please be prepared that this will inevitably turn out to be a pretty long-winded comment, so I guess TL;DR is something like: "
   "\"During college, I was poised to rise as a talented game programmer for Blizzard, but a silly oversight while demonstr8ing my abilities to Morhaime "
     "caused me to have to look elsewhere for the remainder of my game-development career. Oh well!" # TL;DR <--^^-- Vision: Darj,Momo,Jer'sc@,Chen'sJas b@lz;
 "Back when I attended University of California at Irvine in the late 90's, I had the fortune to take the first course that combined 1/3rd my major "
   "(Inform8ion and Computer Science) with 2/3rds students majoring in various Art departments. We were split into something like 10 different teams of "
   "around 6 students each, and were encouraged to collabor8ively design and develop the best simple C++ OpenGL videogame that we could muster within a "
   "single academic quarter. For one of our instructional lectures, Mike Morhaime was invited in as a guest- speaker to teach us all about actual "
   "professional game-development and it was extremely inform8ive, entertaining, and inspiring for our entire class. He also explained that BlizHQ was "
   "only blocks away from our campus and would be glad to recruit us if we ever rose to become the best and brightest. Afterward, he stuck around for "
   "questions and almost all the CS dudes and many of the hardcore War2 and Diablo fans among the artists crowded him for quite a while. Everyone totally "
   "took turns heaping as much praise and admir8ion on him and Blizzard as they could possibly muster, while receiving his attention as though they were "
   "being knighted or something... but I stood back observing the spectacle in disdain. After dozens of seemingly cookie-cutter interactions where nobody "
   "could say or do anything other than fawn or beg, things quieted down for a few seconds and I blurted out \"Diablo is complete shit! I h8 that horrible "
   "game.\" Everyone but him was aghast. They were stupefied. None of my classm8s could imagine anyone in this circumstance saying any such thing and it "
   "seemed I insulted all of their honor or something, like I threw a grenade into their circle-jerk. He immeD8ly ignored everyone else scoffing, "
   "protesting, or vying for his time and asked skeptically why I thought so. My frank critical answers to his engaging questions made the whole crowd "
   "even more astonished. Then they became not only pissed that I had offended their lord, but that now I was monopolizing his attention. We conversed at "
   "length about game design and development and it became clear to everyone that I was cut from a different cloth than my presumed peers. He gave me his "
   "card and said I should contact him to setup an interview... while even more disbelief, shame, and jealousy rippled through the couple dozen onlookers. "
 "I was hired into QA shortly afterward and busted my ass to both manually and programmatically stress or break every build of War2 foreign-languages, Mac "
   "Diablo (in spite of my multiplying h8red for it), and then StarCraft. I totally neglected school, failing most of my other courses, working way more "
   "than the part-time schedule that was initially expected (especially during StarCraft b8a, where I had months str8 of over 80-hour work-weeks and a few "
   "even over 100 when we moved QA and TechSupport to better buildings). I mainly only enrolled in college to become a professional game-developer anyway, "
   "so of course Bliz gained my focus... and OMG the overtime paychecks I got were ridiculous! I maintained number 2 on Battle.Net through SC b8a (just "
   "below \"Enoyls\", A.K.A. lead-designer Rob Pardo), kicking everyone else's ass who challenged me. I also soundly bested them all at TeamFortress and "
   "SoulBlade, which almost everyone in QA (if not the entire company) played competitively every day or two as well. I found and duplic8d so many bugs "
   "that nobody else was able to and was proud to dedic8 myself to any and all work there. Then I'm pretty sure it was some few weeks after StarCraft "
   "released and the intense deadline pressures had dramatically cooled down that Morhaime invited me over to the HQ building to demonstr8 all my best code "
   "to see if I could be a good fit to move over from just \"Quality Assurance Programmer\" to actually working on the code-bases for their future games. "
   "I had strong interviews with him, a lead programmer, and a top technical artist first. I was so excited and nervous that when I sat down at one of his "
   "artist's workst8ions to start showing off my demos, I realized that it was running NT instead of 98 (with both installed but the necessary OpenGL DLL "
   "files only setup for the latter). I hastily copied *32.dll between system directories when I needed to be explicit to cherry-pick just the few GL ones. "
   "Maybe I thought I could still use my familiar 4Dos.com shortcuts or tab-completions or something else I forgot wasn't there. Maybe I just was too eager "
   "and forgot how much else a simple glob command would grab. I panicked and Ctrl-C breaked out as soon as I could but it was way too l8. The few of us "
   "there were all a bit shocked since way too many crucially wrong system libraries had clobbered parts of the very expensive running system. I cowered "
   "back and apologized profusely and tried to explain or justify why I made such a catastrophic mistake, but Morhaime and the artist basically ignored me "
   "and swooped in to restore the system as well as possible from other machines on their network. I blew my shot. They restored the machine. I reiter8d "
   "how sorry I was. I was not hired up or ever seriously considered again, but they let me stay in QA until I decided to go elsewhere a few weeks l8r. "
 "Such a blunder! Oops! I guess that's how it goes sometimes. After about 8 months of working extremely hard for Blizzard in QA, I was able to go on and "
   "work on many other interesting games throughout the decade of my career that followed. In 2008, I burned out and broke down and basically retired to "
   "Wisconsin, where I've been now for another much slower-paced decade. Since then, I've mainly just worked on my GitHub Octology project and kept to "
   "myself... but I'll never forget how disappointed I was after my demonstr8ion failure for Morhaime that day. Sorry if my story here was too dull and "
   "irrelevant and un- funny, but hopefully someone can find it at least a little rel8able. I still wish Morhaime and all skilled developers a good future, "
   "even if Blizzard must become only a shadow of its former glory. Good Game! ;) Peace, -Pip" # Very nice tight <160 by x <50 almost solid page fitting! =) ;

    other influential games BattleZone, Defender also appear. Atari's BattleZone is the first arcade game to fE8ure a true 3-D environment. Ultima becomes
    the first home computer game with 4-directional scrolling. StarFire is the 1st cockpit game, && the 1st arcade game to fE8ure a high-score table using
    players' initials (PAS).  1981: Nintendo's DonkeyKong && Atari's Tempest are released. The UnitedSt8s arcade game industry reaches $5 billion.   1982:
    Gottlieb's Q*bert is released. Sega's arcade game Zaxxon becomes the 1st arcade game 2 be advertised on television. L8 in the year, arcade game income
    drops, && it appears that another video-game industry crash is coming, one that is larger than the 1977 crash.     1983: The video-game industry crash
    affects the home video-game industry. Nintendo's FamiCom system released in Nippon. Atari's I,Robot is the first raster video-game with filled-polygon
    3-D graphics.  Atari's vector game StarWars is released.   1984: The video-game industry crash continues.  RDI releases the Halcyon, a laserdisc-based
    home video-game system.  1985: Nintendo releases a new version of its FamiCom, renamed the Nintendo-Entertainment-System (NES), in the UnitedSt8s. Its

  my own tweet which says something to the effect of: "To be beneficially self-conscious, strive to be predominantly aware of your own limit8ions and how..."
  "... you might be hurt. Then attempt to proceed and move forward into the uncertainty that potential futures represent, in spite of the risks assoC8d!" -PS;

{000} Hi. I'd like to announce my new book:          # Hello. I am PedantPip && I would like to preface this video with a disclaimer: Of course I have not
{040} Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life,          #   had any opportunity to read Dr. Peterson's new book yet. Also, he should not have been expected to
{080} which I've been working on diligently          #   address every possible criticism when he is merely introducing the material through obvious
{090} for the past three years.                      #   summariz8ion of the topics that l8r chapters surely delve into much gr8r detail on. Please take my
{0D0} As of today, the book is available for         #   commentary && critiques with a "grain-of-salt". I would prefer that I, && others, be fair with him.

{0Pi} below. I've also included a link to the
{0Rf} Beyond Order page on my website:
{0UU} JordanBPeterson.Com, where links to book
{0Xc} retailers in different countries
{0Ya} will be posted, as they become available.
{0cn} Beyond Order will also be published as
{0er} an e-book, and as an audio book, which I
{0gE} have nearly finished recording.
{0ja} All formats will be released on Tuesday,
{0ld} March 2nd, 2021.
{0qm} I want to provide you with a sense of
{0sE} the book, in addition to announcing its
{0uU} existence. So I thought I would read you
{0xR} a section from the Overture,
{10g} the introduction, which describes the
{12r} book's contents in some detail.
{168} Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life.
{1B0} Why Beyond Order? It is simple in some         # Does "Beyond Order" just indic8 "Chaos" that is past the periphery of any established and known order?
{1F0} regard.                                        # While I can agree, at least, that it *is* simple, in some regard, I think you're oversimplifying here.
{1G0} Order is explored territory. We are in         # Order is also, technically, sequences of traversal thru unexplored territory, or not territory at all.
{1J0} order when the actions we deem                 # Aren't we "in-order" when just any actions produce orderly results somehow, regardless of deem or aim?
{1K0} approprE8 produce the results we aim           # Are you also counting inaction as a thing that is sometimes deemed an approprE8 "action"? Just curious.
{1N0} at. We regard such outcomes positively,        # When "in-order", do actions always require that an eventual outcome aim accompany them ahead-of-time?
{1Q0} indic8ing as they do,                          # Are you sure that produced results are fully equivalent to outcomes? Are aims also always desires?
{1R0} first, that we have moved closer to what       # I'd also contend that production of aimed-at results is different than merely moving somewhat closer
{1T0} we desire, and second,                         #   to whatever it might be that "we" desire. Our aims, desires, actions, results, etc. are not the same!
{1U0} that our theory about how the world            # I also don't think every orderly action needs to depend on a coherent theory of how the world works.
{1W0} works remains acceptably accur8.               # How could anyone be determining meaningfully whether our collective theory remains "acceptably accur8"?
{1Z0} Nonetheless, all st8s of order, no             # I disagree with "all" here. Probably some st8s of order are properly understood as flawless, at least
{1b0} matter how secure and comfortable,             #   for some purposes, && under known constraints. I think it *does* matter gr8ly just how secure st8s
{1e0} have their flaws. Our knowledge of how to      #   of order are. Comfort shouldn't factor in much. Maybe you mean something unobvious with st8 "flaws"?
{1h0} act in the world remains eternally             # Speak for yourself! You don't know what I know. Knowledge of many sorts may remain somewhat incomplete
{1j0} incomplete,                                    #   but even just the "world" is probably not "eternal". Maybe you just mean like "almost constantly"?
{1k0} partly because of our profound ignorance       # How to act perfectly in the world may prove impossible due to sufficiently, essentially, or effectively
{1m0} of the vast unknown,                           #   boundless "unknowns", but knowledge generally grows at the expense of any ignorance. Profound how?
{1n0} partly because of our willful blindness,       # Please speak for yourself again! I am not willfully blind in any way that I know of, so I probably do
{1q0} and partly because the world continues,        #   not belong in your use of "our". I'd suggest that the "entropic manner" of the world causes most
{1s0} in its entropic manner, to transform           #   transform8ions we care about to be predictable && expectable. You sure the world transforms itself?
{1v0} itself unexpectedly.                           # Just because *you* don't expect transform8ions that occur doesn't mean that nobody did, or could have.
{200} Furthermore, the order we strive to            # Personally, I don't strive to impose hardly any order on the world. In what ways do you? Yes, imposed
{220} impose on the world can rigidify as a          #   "order" can be too rigid, especially when intending to elimin8 all unknowns foolishly, but exactly
{240} consequence of ill-advised attempts            #   who are you talking about that advises others to try to do so? Upon reflection, it seems you don't
{260} to eradic8 from consider8ion all that          #   mean "advise" literally, but are just trying to convey that such attempts are bad ideas. Is imposed
{290} is unknown.                                    #   order ever *not* rigid though? I guess there can be "too flimsy" or "too inflexible" for some cases.
{2A0} When such attempts go too far,                 # So then, by "impose on the world" are you meaning just on other people, but not the actual planet? ...
{2C0} totalitarianism threatens,                     #   or are you using "totalitarianism" in a broader sense as being applicable to our whole environment?
{2E0} driven by the desire to exercise full          # Are you even sure anyone actually desires "full" control, of the entire world (&& maybe universe too)?
{2G0} control,                                       # Who even thinks "full" control *is* possible? Eradic8ing most from consider8ion is closed-mindedness.
{2H0} where such control is not possible, even       # For some reasonable definitions of "full", I would argue that it *is* possible to control the world.
{2K0} in principle.                                  #   Such cases are probably especially possible when someone is just exerting control "in principle".
{2M0} This means risking a dangerous                 # What do you mean by "this" here? Desire for full control? Again, do you mean "world-control" as only
{2N0} restriction of all the psychological and       #   applicable to humans? Why say the "world" when you mean something more like "civiliz8ion" instead?
{2P0} social changes                                 # I highly doubt whatever "this" was truly risks restriction of "all" changes that are necessary. Many?
{2Q0} necessary to maintain adapt8ion to the         # Are you even sure psychological && social changes are absolutely "necessary" for adapt8ion either?
{2T0} ever-changing world,                           # Honestly, in most of the ways we're primarily concerned with, our "world" is *not* "ever-changing".
{2V0} and so we find ourselves inescapably           # There might be some "escapes", though we're probably faced with many more than just *one* single need.
{2Y0} faced with a need to move beyond order,        # Sometimes we may need to move from some particular order to different ones, not just into pure chaos.
{2a0} into its opposite, chaos.                      # I think order versus chaos is often a false-dichotomy, but even ignoring that, it seems that they're
                                                     #   not always best understood as technically opposites either. To be a thorough opposite of something,
                                                     #   an entity probably needs some threshold degree of order to prove sufficiently capable of opposing.
                                                     # Is there some ambiguous "middle-ground" laying between order && chaos that can be discerned as neither?
                                                     # Can there be a third category that's not just a combin8ion of those, but rather fundamentally distinct?
                                                     # What I am trying to get at here is the likelihood that a proper opposite of an "order" is something
                                                     #   like the reverse-order, not the more degener8 case of apparent dis-order. Other inverses are useful.
{2d0} If order is where what we want makes           # Speak for yourself again, please! I doubt that order *is* the only place where what *you* want occurs.
{2f0} itself known when we act in accordance         # You probably don't really mean "makes itself known" there, right? Like things wanted are usually not
{2h0} with our hard-won wisdom,                      #   conscious themselves or capable of making anything known, revealing themselves, or self-manifesting.
                                                     # Plenty of wants are achieved without any wise actions. Do you mean all humanity wisely wants the same?
                                                     # I take issue with your insistence that both order && chaos are separable places "where" some particular
                                                     #   thing or another occurs. Are you certain that each are localizable && properly understood regionally?
{2j0} chaos is where what we do not expect, or       # Just because "we" did not expect something, I don't think this sufficiently indic8s being inside chaos.
{2l0} ever remain blind to,                          # Probably no human-being can live forever, therefore we cannot "ever" remain blind (or anything else).
{2m0} leaps forward from the potential that          # So you're saying chaos has directionality && an ability to abruptly lurch? Just from potential around?
{2o0} surrounds us.                                  # If there's any way I discover to avoid remaining "blind" to something "visible", I intend to employ it.
{2q0} The fact that something has occurred           # It probably depends on what that "something" is though. The fact that star-matter moved around many
{2r0} many times in the past, is no guarantee        #   times in the past, is probably as good as a guarantee that it will continue to, in a similar manner.
{2u0} that it will continue to occur in the          # I guess it also hinges on what you're assuming or implying qualifies as "guarantee" or adequ8ly "same".
{2v0} same manner.                                   #   The paradox: "The only constant is change!" springs to mind, after listening to your phrasing there.
{2x0} There exists, eternally, a domain beyond       # I am skeptical that any overwhelmingly finite being (such as man) can feasibly identify any "eternity".
{320} what we know and can predict.                  # According to you, is the domain that lays within what we know && can predict also existing eternally?
                                                     # Can there only be something like a "zero-sum-game" oper8ing between these unlimited competing domains?
{340} Chaos is anomaly, novelty,                     # If you're overwhelmingly engulfed in chaos for long enough, then it's order that becomes anomalous,
{360} unpredictability,                              #   novel, unexpected, transform8ive, && disturbing... at least as I seem to recall encountering each.
{380} transform8ion, disruption, and all too often   # Speak for yourself. Just because *you* take the reliability of things for granted doesn't mean "we" do.
{3B0} dissent, as what we have come to take for      # Assuming that unreliable things are comprehensible as merely static && trustworthy *is* a big problem!
{3D0} granted reveals itself as unreliable.          # Similarly, assumptions && presumptions that reliable things will behave in uncertain ways is also dumb.
{3H0} Sometimes it manifests itself gently,          # I must be quite the agent of chaos then, since I sometimes manifest myself gently, but not usually! ;}
{3K0} revealing its mysteries and experiences
{3L0} that makes us curious,                         # I have to wrap this up. Haven't you had enough of my contentiousness yet, Dr. Peterson? Never quit? =}
{3N0} compelled, and interested. This is
{3Q0} particularly likely, although not
{3R0} inevitable,
{3S0} when we approach what we do not
{3U0} understand voluntarily, with careful
{3W0} prepar8ion
{3X0} and discipline. Other times, the
{3Z0} unexpected makes itself known terribly
{3c0} suddenly, accidentally. So we are undone
{3f0} and fall apart,
{3g0} and can only put ourselves back together
{3i0} with great difficulty,
{3k0} if at all. Neither the st8 of order nor
{3o0} the st8 of chaos is preferable,
{3p0} intrinsically,
{3q0} to the other. That is the wrong way to
{3t0} look at it.
{3u0} Nonetheless, in my previous book: 12 Rules
{3x0} for Life:
{400} An Antidote to Chaos, I focus more on how
{430} the consequences of too much chaos might
{450} be remeD8d.
{460} We respond to sudden and unpredictable
{490} change by preparing,
{4A0} physiologically and psychologically, for
{4C0} the worst,
{4E0} and because only God Himself knows what
{4G0} this worst might be,
{4H0} we must, in our ignorance, prepare for all
{4K0} eventualities,
{4M0} and the problem with that continual
{4N0} prepR8ion is that,
{4P0} in excess, it exhausts us,
{4S0} but that does not imply in any manner
{4U0} that chaos should be elimin8d.
{4W0} An impossibility in any case. Although
{4Y0} what is unknown needs to be managed
{4a0} carefully,
{4b0} as my previous book repeatedly stressed.
{4e0} Whatever is not touched by the new
{4g0} stagn8s and it is certainly the case
{4i0} that a life without curiosity,
{4l0} that instinct pushing us out into the
{4n0} unknown, would be a much
{4o0} diminished form of existence.
{4r0} What is new is also what is exciting,
{4t0} compelling, and provoc8ive,
{4v0} assuming that the r8 at which it is
{4x0} introduced does not intolerably
{500} undermine and destabilize our st8 of
{550} being. Like 12 Rules for Life, the current
{570} volume provides an explic8ion of rules
{5A0} drawn from a longer list of 42, originally
{5C0} published and popularized on the Q-&&-A
{5E0} website: Quora. Unlike my previous book,
{5I0} Beyond Order explores, as its overarching theme,
{5L0} how the dangers of too much security and
{5N0} control might be profitably avoided.
{5R0} Because what we understand is
{5T0} insufficient, as we discover when things
{5V0} we are striving to control
{5W0} nonetheless go wrong around us, we need
{5Z0} to keep one foot within
{5a0} order, while stretching the other
{5c0} tent8ively into the beyond,
{5f0} and so we are driven to explore and find
{5i0} the deepest of meanings in standing on
{5k0} the frontier,
{5l0} secure enough to keep our fear under
{5n0} control, but learning,
{5o0} constantly learning, as we face what we
{5r0} have not yet made peace with or adapted to.
{5v0} It is this instinctive meaning, something
{5x0} far deeper than mere thought,
{610} that orients us properly in life, so that
{630} we do not become overwhelmed by what is
{650} beyond us
{660} or, equally dangerously, stultified and
{690} stunted by d8d,
{6B0} too narrow, or too pridefully paraded
{6D0} systems of value and belief.
{6H0} What have I written about, more
{6J0} specifically?
{6L0} Rule 1 describes the rel8ionship
{6N0} between stable
{6O0} predictable social structures and
{6Q0} individual psychological health,
{6S0} and makes the case that such structures
{6U0} need to be upd8d by crE8ive people, if
{6X0} they are to retain
{6Y0} their vitality. Rule 2
{6b0} analyzes a centuries-old alchemical
{6d0} image, relying on several stories,
{6f0} ancient and modern, to illumin8 the
{6i0} n8ure and development of the integr8d
{6k0} human personality.
{6m0} Rule 3 warns of the dangers of avoiding
{6p0} the inform8ion,
{6q0} vital to the continued rejuven8ion of
{6s0} the psyche,
{6t0} signaled by the emergence of neg8ive
{6v0} emotions such as pain,
{6x0} anxiety, and fear.
{720} Rule 4 argues that the meaning that
{740} sustains people through difficult times,
{760} is to be found not so much in happiness,
{790} which is fleeting,
{7A0} but in the voluntary adoption of m8ure
{7C0} responsibility for the self and others.
{7G0} Rule 5 uses a single example, drawn from
{7J0} my experience as a clinical psychologist,
{7M0} to illustr8 the personal and social
{7O0} necessity of attending to the dict8s
{7Q0} of conscience.
{7S0} Rule 6 describes the danger of
{7U0} attributing the cause of complex
{7W0} individual and social problems
{7Y0} to single variables, such as sex, class,
{7b0} or power. Rule 7
{7f0} outlines the crucial rel8ionship
{7h0} between discipline striving in a single
{7j0} direction,
{7k0} and forging of the individual character
{7m0} capable of resilience in the face of
{7o0} adversity.
{7q0} Rule 8 focuses on the vital importance
{7t0} of aesthetic experience
{7u0} as a guide to what is true, good, and
{7x0} sustaining,
{800} in the human world of experience.
{830} Rule 9 makes the case that past
{860} experiences,
{870} whose current recall remains laden with
{890} pain and fear,
{8A0} can be stripped of their horror by
{8C0} voluntary verbal explor8ion
{8E0} and reconsider8ion.
{8I0} Rule 10 notes the importance of explicit
{8L0} negotE8ion,
{8M0} to maintenance of the good-will, mutual
{8P0} regard, and
{8Q0} heartfelt cooper8ion, without which no
{8S0} true romance can be sustained.
{8W0} Rule 11 opens by describing the world of
{8Y0} human experience
{8Z0} in a manner that explains what motiv8s
{8b0} three common, but
{8d0} direly dangerous, patterns of
{8e0} psychological response,
{8g0} delinE8s the catastrophic consequences
{8j0} of falling prey to any, or all, of them,
{8l0} and lays out an altern8ive route.
{8o0} Rule 12, finally, makes the case that
{8s0} thankfulness, in the face of the
{8t0} inevitable tragedies of life,
{8w0} should be regarded as a primary
{8x0} manifest8ion of the admirable moral courage
{920} required to continue our difficult march
{980} uphill. I hope that I am somewhat wiser in my
{9A0} explic8ion of this second set of 12
{9C0} rules than I was four years ago,
{9E0} when I wrote about the first dozen, not
{9G0} least because of the inform8ive
{9I0} feedback I received in the course of my
{9K0} efforts to formul8 my ideas for
{9M0} audiences around the world,
{9O0} in-person, on YouTube, and through my
{9Q0} podcast and blog.
{9T0} I hope, in consequence, that I have
{9V0} managed to clarify some of the issues
{9W0} that were perhaps
{9X0} left less than optimally developed in my
{9Z0} previous work,
{9a0} as well as presenting much that is
{9c0} original.
{9e0} Finally, I hope that people find this
{9h0} book as helpful personally,
{9j0} as they seem to have found the first set
{9k0} of twelve rules.
{9m0} It has been a source of immense
{9o0} gratific8ion, that so many people have
{9q0} reported drawing strength from the
{9s0} thoughts and the stories
{9t0} I have had the privilege of bringing
{9v0} forth, and sharing.

{000} You're an admirer of Erich Neumann {020} and of Carl Jung. (Yes.) Yeah and that's... the Neumann {040} connection is really interesting 'cause I
{050} think he's a bloody genius. (Yes.) I really like {080} The Great Mother. [It] is a great book and {090} really a gr8 warning that book... and
{0B0} also The Origins and History of {0D0} Consciousness. (Yeah, one of the most influential books, yep.) That's so interesting. {0H0} I read an essay that
  you wrote. (Yes.) I don't remember what it was. (A lecture I gave on Neumann at N.Y.U..) Yes, it's {0N0} always been staggering to me that that
{0P0} book hasn't had the impact that it {0R0} should have had, I mean Jung himself in the {0S0} preface to that book wrote that that was {0V0} the book that
  he wished that he would {0W0} have written. It's very much assoC8d {0X0} with Jung's Symbols of Transform8ion and {0a0} it was a major influence on my book:
  Maps {0c0} of Meaning, which was an attempt to {0e0} outline the universal archetypes {0g0} that are portrayed in the kind of {0i0} religious structures
  that you {0k0} put forward, but the thing that I really {0m0} see happening, and you can tell me what {0n0} you think about this, in Neumann's book
{0q0} consciousness, which is masculine, {0s0} symbolically masculine for a variety of {0u0} reasons, is viewed as rising up {0x0} against the counter-vailing
  force of {120} tragedy from an underlying feminine, {140} symbolically feminine, unconsciousness, {160} right, and it's something that can always
{180} be pulled back into that unconsciousness. {1A0} That would be... the microcosm of that {1C0} would be the Freudian Oedipal Mother {1E0} familial dynamic
  where the mother {1G0} was so over-protective and {1J0} all-encompassing that she interferes {1K0} with the development of the competence {1M0} not only of
  her sons, but also of her {1O0} daughters, of her children in general and {1P0} it seems to me that that's the dynamic {1S0} that's being played out in our
  society {1U0} right now is that there's this... and it's {1W0} rel8d in some way that I don't {1X0} understand, to this insistence {1Z0} that all forms of
  masculine authority {1c0} are nothing but tyrannical power. So the {1e0} symbolic represent8ion is tyrannical {1h0} father with no appreC8ion for the
{1k0} benevolent father, and benevolent mother {1m0} with no appreC8ion whatsoever for the {1p0} tyrannical mother, right? ... and that's that...
{1q0} 'cause I thought of ideologies as {1t0} fragmentary mythologies. That's where {1v0} they get their archetypal and {1w0} psychological power, right? ...
  and so in a {200} balanced represent8ion, you have the {220} terrible mother and the gr8 mother, as {240} Neumann laid out so nicely, and you have
{270} the terrible father and the gr8 father, {290} so that's the fact that culture mangles {2B0} you half-to-death, while it's also promoting you and
{2D0} developing you. You have to see that as {2F0} balanced, and then you have the heroic {2H0} and adversarial individual, but in the {2J0} post-modern
  world, and this seems to be {2L0} something that's increasingly seeping {2N0} out into the culture at large, you have {2P0} nothing but the tyrannical
  father, {2R0} nothing but the destructive force of {2U0} masculine consciousness, and nothing but {2W0} the benevolent gr8 mother, {2Z0} and it's an
  appalling ideology {2b0} and it seems to me that it's sucking the {2d0} vitality, which is exactly what you would {2f0} expect symbolically, it's sucking
  the {2h0} vitality of our culture. You see that {2j0} with the increasing demolition of {2m0} young men, and not only young men, in {2p0} terms of their
  academic performance, {2r0} which they're falling way behind in {2t0} elementary school, way behind in junior {2u0} high, and bailing out of the
  universities {2w0} like mad.    HTTPS://YouTu.be/-jM2fpm6fnA "JP-TF&&DM" HAA:2x0 && HTTPS://YouTu.be/XD6qeWSA6rA "JP:TheDevouringMotherArchetype" # I4A:1WZ0;
