00:00 because you said that he gives religion or even evolution is religion and that upset a lot of atheist because they figure you know they want nothing to
00:11 do with religion so I thought we'd talk about that for a little bit so I know you claim you like to throw out there that evolution and oh absolutely
00:23 Everly you have to define two words in that sentence or what do you mean by evolution and what do you mean by religion standard dictionary definition
00:29 of religion is a belief or belief system on how the world got here is kind of how there's many different religions in the world obviously how did we get
00:39 here so it's something you believe as opposed to a science which is testable observable demonstrable in a laboratory for example evolution has six
00:49 different meanings to the word I cover this in my seminar part four you'd have to have cosmic evolution the origin of time space matter you'd have to
00:59 have chemical evolution the origin of all the chemicals then you'd have to have stellar evolution all the stars would have to evolve you'd have to have
01:04 organic evolution life would has to start from nonliving material you'd have to have macro evolution where this life-form changed two different kinds
01:11 of life and then you have Micro evolution which is changes within the kind like dogs and wolves probably have a common ancestor only number six on that
01:23 list micro evolution is actually science all the other five are religious so when I use the word evolution I am not referring to minor variations within
01:34 the same kind Darwin wrote a book called the Origin of Species the argument is really not about speciation it's about kinds where do the kinds come from
01:42 there are 900 species of bats in the world they probably had a common ancestor right I put in six different sections totally unrelated categories all
02:13 five of the top five are purely religious no one has ever seen a dog produce a non dog so that would be a no that way well do you believe dogs came from
02:27 something ultimately that was non dog if you go back long enough far enough ago in time well and that you're welcome to believe that but that's my point
02:38 that's a religious belief that's not scientifically observable we have humans having babies all the time and they're always human dogs have puppies all
02:45 the time and they're always dogs my point is then it's not then it's not typical science look up the definition of science if science from their Latin
03:01 words see or to know things that we know by observation testing experimentation can you do some observation to see an animal produce a different kind why
03:10 would you believe it you believe a dog pointing something watch well you could see them grow you could you could document that that example you cannot
03:31 see or document dogs coming from non dogs or dogs and bananas having a common ancestor that isn't nobody documents it well I could take a picture every
03:44 day of my finger nails and probably I think three months it grows from cuticle to cutting length is typical for your fingernails in about six months for
03:50 the toenails well this is where you have to first define what you mean by science and so I think the standard definition in any dictionary is going to be
04:09 seer to know what do we know by observation experimentation and testing you don't you don't know that dogs came from this a common ancestor with tomatoes
04:21 you can believe that but nobody knows that you can't know such a thing that's purely religious which is my point # It seems to be quite a stretch trying
# to demonstr8 limit8ions on the amount of time scientific observ8ions can be made by using toenail growth as example, but the main point I want to extract out
# of the above message was the supposed list of six different forms of evolution which all would need to have happened to produce life, since it sounds accur8
# but each of the initial stages obviously are not biological or explained by n8ural selection. Once those are noted, I will probably delete lame transcript;
# I6PM6PSI:Of course the shuffling of chronology for the above mostly waste of a text at least has title somewhat addressed by explor8ion of "f8hs" early l8r;

From the JW.Org Bible Teach booklet titled "What Does the Bible Really Teach?", ElderJohn asked that I consider Chapter 3 which starts on Page 27 && is titled
"What Is God's Purpose for the Earth?" with sub-topics "What is God's purpose for mankind?", "How has God been challenged?", && "What will life on earth be
like in the future?". After reading through it once, the part that stood out to me as particularly disagreeable starts on the bottom of Page 32 under heading
"How s8n's World Will Be Removed" which encapsul8s the following two paragraphs of text regarding their millenarian restor8ionist eschatology from prophecy:
  "With each passing year, the world is becoming more && more dangerous. It is overrun with warring armies, dishonest politicians, hypocritical religious
leaders, && hardened criminals. The world as a whole is beyond reform. The Bible reveals that the time is near when God will elimin8 the wicked world during
[h]is war of Armageddon. This will make way for a righteous new world. -RevL8ion 16:14-16." # Below quot8ion embeds several unescaped double-quotes throughout;
  "Jehovah God selected Jesus Christ to be Ruler of His heavenly Kingdom, or government. Long ago, the Bible foretold: "A child has been born to us, a son has
been given to us; && the government will rest on his shoulder. His name will be called... Prince of Peace. To the increase of his government and to peace,
there will be no end." (Isaiah 9:6, 7, footnote) Regarding this government, Jesus taught his followers to pray: "Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take
place, as in heaven, also on earth." (Matthew 6:10) As we will see l8r in this book, God's Kingdom will soon remove all the governments of this world, && it
itself will replace all of them. (Read Daniel 2:44.) Then God's Kingdom will usher in an earthly paradise." # Curious of why JW denomin8ion is nontrinitarian;
# So there's a lot that could be delved further into there && contended against eventually, but my initial thoughts, plans, notes, && ideas are formul8d next;
Regarding world potentially becoming more dangerous year by year: John's first example was school shootings, so probably investig8 prevalence of such shootings
in U.S. && other western societies schools over time, mass shootings in general, && global gun f8lities all together probably providing some refut8ion there.
Then recommend HumanProgress.Org && Steven Pinker's TED talk from April 2018, published to YouTube on May 21st, titled "Is the world getting better or worse?
A look at the numbers" as a good present8ion on optimism about progress. By his 10 measured areas: 0) Life, 1) Health, 2) Sustenance, 3) Prosperity, 4) Peace,
5) Freedom, 6) Safety, 7) Knowledge, 8) Leisure, 9) Happiness, improvement is mostly slow && steady. Concede that even if life could be said to get worse each
year, it doesn't seem clear that would indic8 s8n staying in power either though, or sin && suffering necessarily prevailing generally. Might be a finer point.
Then contempl8 accus8ion that belief in evolution requires f8h in the same (or sufficiently similar) fashion as belief in God does. Initially contend that the
amount of objective evidence in support of each, && therefore reasons to believe, are not comparable. Further explore his contention that there remains some
degree of inadequ8 evidence for adapt8ion producing observed varE8ion between sepR8 species (if that's what he meant?), beyond just modific8ion of each alone;
So maybe initial definitions should be evalU8d, exploring the referenced verse about f8h concerning expect8ion && hope, but also incorpor8ing holding beliefs
without any reason (blind) or bolstered by various degrees of evidence as increasingly reliable in ability to accur8ly predict outcomes in some useful manner.
Then delve into recognition of distinctions between micro && macro evolution (which I earlier described as drift versus emergent attribute adapt8ion), which
may also be characterized descriptively as individu8ion versus speC8ion, on a somewhat broader scale. Evidence seems to be compounding ongoingly for the best
estim8s we have for dur8ion of existence of our universe, sun, planet, && life-forms, as well as indic8ions that both forms of evolution are likely to have
occurred (primarily through n8ural selection). Some science is not merely reliant on immeD8 observ8ion, but can include various forms of logical induction,
extrapol8ion, etc. so while in some slightly valid sense it may require a purportedly equivalent degree of "f8h" (even sometimes also considered "blind" too)
to believe that the l8st theory of evolution accounts for speC8ion (which of course none of us have lived long enough to have observed in complete action), it
is a misrepresent8ion to argue that this belongs in the same league as the rel8ively static degree of evidence used as justific8ion for the existence of God.
RevL8ion does not appear to be any ongoing and compounding transmission of God's word or power, so it's probably misguided to claim both competing explan8ions
for the existence of life as we know it to require the same levels of f8h. Believing in God might be better categorized as "blind" while not so for evolution;

[Music] premiere podcasts a very good afternoon and welcome along to unbelievable I'm Justin Briley and this is the show every Saturday afternoon here on
premiere Christian radio as part of faith explored that brings Christians and non-christians together for conversations that matter and we'll be diving deep
into philosophical arguments for the existence of God today on the show really excited about the guests joining me today I'll be introducing them in a
moment's time straight after unbelievable this afternoon on the profile between 4 and 5 Sam Hale sits down with us Pastor John Mark coma really worth
listening to that if you're into leadership and ER how he's reaching Millennials in one of America's most secular cities also available on its own podcast the
profile look for that on iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts and don't forget that there's special deals available from unbelievable in the run-up to
Christmas as well go to the website of the unbelievable book for the latest Christmas bundle that we're offering of the unbelievable book signed edition plus
two conference DVDs for a really fabulous price that's an unbelievable book co dot uk' well let's get into today's debate or today on the program we're
debating five proofs of the existence of God and joined on the show today by two philosophers ed fazer is a Catholic philosopher who teaches in California his
latest book five proofs of the existence of God takes what he believes are five of the strongest philosophical arguments for God from antiquity and presents
them afresh opposite him today is atheist philosopher Arif Ahmed who teaches at Cambridge University his books include evidence design and causality among
other titles and you can find both of them at their respective web pages edward fazer calm or at the philosophy page at the university of cambridge website
Phil candor a co uk but today on the program Arif will be engaging with IDI on two of the arguments in Ed's books specifically the Aristotelian proof and the
rationalist proof if you can pronounce them you'll find out what they are today why ed believes they lead inexorably to the conclusion that God exists and why
Arif doesn't and this is gonna be one of those shows where we dive fairly deep into philosophy and we're going to try to keep the terminology as accessible as
possible but we will be our you to put your thinking caps on so don't forget you can listen back any time via the podcast of course premier Christian radio
calm / unbelievable well the IDI and Arif is great to have you in studio and and on the line IDI today on the program Barry for come to you in a moment as
someone who's been on the show in the past but newcomer to the show today is Edie fazer Edie welcome along to the program it's great to be here thanks for
having me it's great to have you on because you've been a difficult fish to catch because I've had so many requests for you to be on this program over the
years from especially my North American listeners and finally with the publication of this recent book it provided the perfect opportunity to bring you on the
line tell me how long have you been in philosophy is that something you've kind of had a passion for from your teenage years yes I have since about the time I
was 18 or 19 I took a course in Greek literature and we covered the pre-socratic philosophers and I've been hooked ever since that did it for me so that was
the I guess the late 80s early 90s when I got interested in it and then I got my PhD in 1999 and I've been teaching ever since and you're a Catholic in terms
of your religious commitments and again is that something you've acquired along the way that something you were brought up with it's I guess you could say
it's both I was I was brought up Catholic but I I left the Catholic Church and I became an atheist in my late teenage years around the same time I got
interested in philosophy so as an atheist for about a decade or so roughly the 1990s that period was my atheist period say and then I late in graduate school
working on stuff out you know in an extracurricular way it had nothing to do with what I was writing my dissertation on or any courses I was taking in grad
school but given things I was reading outside of outside of class as it were I gradually worked my way back into theism and then I came back into the Catholic
Church in the early 2000s around 2001 or so so in a sense the philosophy very much part of your faith journey in that sense and that absolutely yeah yeah so
so this new book are these the five ways of IDI phaser is how you're taunting this well that's that's a fair question I when I was working on the book I
initially had as the working title for proofs of the existence of God and I was a little bit wary because the book is not on Aquinas as five proof so there is
some overlap and I've written on Aquinas as arguments before but I was a bit wary of giving the impression that I was somehow trying to top Aquinas or pit my
own five ways against Aquinas is or something that was not my intention but as I was working on the book it dawned on me at you know the more the more I
worked on it that there was a fifth line of argument that I really thought ought to be included so I thought well I'm just going to go ahead and call it five
proofs and then hope people wouldn't get the wrong impression from that I don't know maybe in the future we'll be talking about the PFAs Arian way of thinking
about philosophy but I appreciate you didn't want to totally over blame where you're coming from but obviously people like some Thomas Aquinas Aristotle and
others have been very influential in what you think oh yeah some of the most compelling arguments I mean it's interesting even in the title proof we I've
often heard theologians apologist philosophers distanced themselves from the word proof when it comes to God right because they say you can't prove these
things you can you can have evidence you can have an argument but you can't have a proof that sent when we only get in maths or something like that what why
why do you use the word proof here yeah I use I guess a couple things I could say about that first of all I use the word proof and and this is true of a lot
of the terminology I use and might various writings including this book I use the term in a way that's that might be more common in scholastic writers and
writers like Thomas Aquinas but also in more recent scholastic writers writers in the scholastic tradition Thomas Fathers of Thomas Aquinas other other people
like that who writing in the late 19th century throughout the 20th century into the 21st century and the word proof has has various meanings in the history of
philosophy and I guess I would say that the way I'm using it it's you know more or less synonymous with the word demonstration and it's maybe a usage that's a
bit more common among Thomas and other scholastics and it might be among other contemporary philosophers and certainly for the layman probably has
associations of the word proof that I don't necessarily have in mind but I did use it intentionally and the reason I did is because I'm trying to defend a
pretty traditional conception of natural theology that is to say the project of arguing for God's existence through purely philosophical reasoning purely
philosophical arguments and then the traditional conception of one you see in writers like Aquinas though an Enlightenment were two of the writers that I'm
influenced by but also really goes back to Aristotle and some other ancient Greek thinkers it was a fairly confident approach toward what we could know about
God's existence through reason alone and so I wanted to indicate for one thing that the arguments are not probabilistic arguments they're not arguments to the
best explanation that's not the style of reasoning they employ there's certainly not God of the gaps arguments I'm not a fan at all of God of the gaps
arguments they're not attempts at quasi scientific explanation they're aiming for something a bit more ambitious than that a little more no solid than that
and the idea is that with the arguments start from premises that are either clear from observation we can know they're obvious from observation or we we know
them as metaphysical first principles say and then the conclusion follows from those premises deductively rather than merely probabilistically so that we have
a real demonstration and not just this that's from the interest argument yeah well I'm looking forward to digging into the meat of at least two of the
arguments on the program today and we're doing that in the company of Arif armet who is our atheist philosopher from Cambridge University join us again in
studio I think the last time you were here debating consciousness on with Gazzara Bernstein yeah that's right it's a pleasure to be here Justin well it's
lovely to have you and we heard that story which involved philosophy actually taking him back to theism hmm did philosophy take you away from from belief in
God yourself or was it other circumstances that brought you to to atheism yourself Arif yes I mean that's right I think my director travel is pretty much the
opposite of Ed's that is to say philosophy and science more general scientific education will generally took me away from from believing in those things
probably about my teens and then I've never really changed my mind about since then and as you've got further into philosophy have any arguments ever sort of
made you rethink or wonder if there might be some sort of argumentation for God well I've often wondered about it and I said you wouldn't want to say I have a
closed mind one argument that made me think for a while was the teleological argument so this is the argument an argument that Hume discusses in his dialogues
concerning the design of the universe and the version involving cosmic fine-tuning for a while puzzled me own and I think I've reached a view as to which of
its premises is false now but that was one which for what made me rethink that's interesting I mean do you in principle think that you could prove if you like
in the classical sense of the word proof God and could could you come to a belief in God through a strong enough philosophical argument as far as you're
concerned well I'd like to think so yes that is that I'd like to something I was open to open to argument in my position isn't just based on on some sort of
emotional reaction or rejection of aspects of religion that I find unappealing but are irrelevant to the truth of that statement so I would like to think that
I was open to that I just don't believe there already and I know that your last book edie which was the last superstition is a response to the New Atheism how
are they generally in your view dealt with the kinds of arguments you're dealing with in in this particular book well the New Atheists in my view tend to
direct their fire at straw men and at simplistic versions of the arguments in the case of the arguments that I defended in its new book five proofs I would
say for the most part they're ignored by the New Atheists with the the exception of Richard Dawkins who does unlike some of the other new atheist he does have
something to say about Aquinas and I'll give him credit for that because in Dennett Daniel Dennett in sam harris and some of these other recent new atheist
writers often they just ignore writers like aquinas or writers like live mints or Aristotle or Latinas these these writers that I think are the most
significant ones in the history of natural theology and they tend to pay attention primarily to William Paley and his watchmaker argument as if that were the
main argument for God's existence and that's that's not an argument I'm really a fan of myself mmm when eight when they do pay attention to rise like Aquinas
as I argued in that book that you refer to the last superstition Dawkins really misunderstands the arguments very badly he thinks Aquinas is arguing for a
beginning of the world for example or he thinks that Aquinas is the holding to the premise that everything has a cause or something like that and these are
these are just basic misunderstandings of the argument that I think someone who was familiar with what Aquinas actually said wouldn't make mistakes like that
and just before we get into the arguments Arif what's your view on on the the state of the awareness even of these kinds of classical arguments for the
existence of God among your your atheist peers and so on um I think the position is that it's probably true to say that many of them understand the arguments
in a more or less corrupted form that is unlike the things that Aristotle or the sorry st. Thomas Aquinas or others put forward partly of course that's
because you know they're being translated into a world view which is very distant from that of the Middle Ages you know we have it we have a post Scientific
Revolution way of thinking about the world now and these arguments need to be transplanted into that context in some ways it's not surprising that they would
seem quite bad when you try to do that ok well we're going to begin getting into the whole element of what what why IDI believes that at least five of these
arguments has spelled out in his book still have incredible power today and why Arif believes they don't we're going to be looking at two of the arguments in
Ed's new book five proofs of the existence of God specifically the Aristotelian proof and the rationalist proof and we'll lay them out as we get to them and
if you want to get in touch about anything you hear on today's program I welcome your emails unbelievable at premier dot uk' to send in your thoughts on
today's show at unbelievable JB for the Twitter Facebook calm and believable JB to follow the show on Facebook and leave your comments that way and I look
forward to you talking about it and and discussing it on those various forums and if you want to listen back to today's show and get links to my guests it's
all available from the webpage premier Christian radio.com slash unbelievable unbelievable with Justin dry early so as we debate five proofs of the existence
of God today I'm joined by two philosophers one is Ed fazer Catholic philosopher who teaches in California it's ER his new book 5 proofs of the existence of
God we're looking at today an eruv armed' atheist philosopher from Cambridge University joins me in studio to discuss these with him so I think we're going to
have to start by giving you a little space to lay out the first of these two arguments we're going to look at in the rest of today's show at the Aristotelian
proof so if you'd like to go ahead and do that and then we'll start to discuss it sure yeah the the Aristotelian proof and it's an argument that's the title I
give it in the book and it's inspired by Aristotle though the way I stated is not exactly the way Aristotle states that I try to disentangle the basic thrust
of the reasoning from the archaic physics and archaic cosmology that that Aristotle expressed it in terms of or that later Aristotelian is like the coin it's
expressed it in terms of it's often called traditionally called the argument from motion for an unmoved mover but it's important to understand that for
Aristotle the way Aristotle and other Aristotelian is use the word motion what they have in mind has changed generally not just motion in the modern sense
which is what Aristotelian is traditionally called local motion change with respect to a place or location it's any kind of change like a think of a banana
say sitting on a windowsill and as it gradually ripens it grows it goes from being green to yellow say that would be a kind of motion or change in Aristotle's
sense so the idea is that we know from experience that things are changing and on Aristotle's analysis what change involves is going from potential to actual
it's the actualization of a potential and he developed this idea in reaction to pre Socratic philosophers ancient Greek philosophers like Parmenides and Zeno
who deny that change was possible they thought change would have to involve going from nothingness to something and Aristotle says that's not true change
involves going from potentially being a certain way to being actually a certain way as when the banana goes from being potentially yellow to actually be in
yellow that's the starting point so we know from experience that things are changing it go from potential to actual how does this ever happen though how does
it ever how does anything ever actually undergo change and the answer is that anytime something goes from potential to actual there's something already actual
that's making that happen so take the tea in my cup next to me here in the room here it goes from being hot to being cold from being actually hot and
potentially called to being actually cold and what causes that to happen is the cool air in the in the room surrounding it which is already cool cooler than
the tea anyway and it cools down the the liquid in the cup so we've got things changing and they're being changed by other things they go from potential to
actual and that's made to happen by some other thing that's already actual now what what the aristotelian proof says is that we trace this series of changers
one thing being changed by another being changed by another or to be more precise one thing being actualized by another being actualized by another what we're
doing is we're tracing a series of causes that doesn't just extend backward in time but it extends you might say downward or upward pick your metaphor here
and now and ultimately it depends on the sheer existence of things like the tea or the water that makes up the tea the tea couldn't change at all unless it
existed the water that makes up that he couldn't get cooler unless it existed and its existence in itself depends on the actualization of certain potentials
so the fact that the water that makes up that tea that partly makes up that tea it's hydrogen and oxygen and the molecules that make it up potentially could
form some other substance but instead they form water and so there must be some reasonable here and now why that's the case I mean that actualizes that
potential rather than some other so the idea is that when we trace causes downward here and now or again upward if you want to use that metaphor instead we
trace them downward here and now we get is one thing being actualized by another being actualized by another and the only place the buck can stop the only
place we can read it reach an ultimate explanation is if we get to something that can actualize all these other things without itself being actualized it's
what I call in the book an unnatural eyes dak Shu eliezer or a purely actual actualize err it can actualize everything else with itself being actualized
because it's already always as it were purely actual it's got no potentials that need to be or could be actualized so it's a kind of uncaused cause and a
traditional meaning not one that simply happens to lack a cause but something that could not have had a cause in principle because it's already pure actuality
and in no way potential and then when you unpack that concept you find that we have to attribute the traditional divine attributes being outside time and
space being immaterial being an impotent omission etc to this one actualized actualize err or as Aristotle will call it unmoved mover that's the basic idea
yeah and so God as it were stops this infinite regress because you have to have something which can act should be actualized but is not itself actualized in
in the very first instant if you like in order for anything to to have causes you know the the the stretch back okay well right and and I would add and I
would just emphasize real quickly that again this the series we're talking about here and the causation we're talking about here God's causation is something
going on here and now we're not tracing causes back okay has to a big bang or anything like that but to a sustaining cause here and now okay that's that's a
helpful clarification okay let's say here where you go on this I'm probably just going to leave it to you guys to do this one out for most of this show and
I'll just try and keep us to time gents but where do you go with this one Arif thank you Justin um well I mean one thing I would say the outset is that these
are discussions of very abstract matters than generally very far removed from everyday experience so for that reason I think it's important to have precise
definitions of the terms that are being used because everyday terms like cause and so on you know are used in a variety of ways and can mean different things
and it's important not to slip from one meaning of that term to another in the course of the argument so precise definitions are important now the word course
itself has been defined in different ways but there is philosophers by Hume can't think it's been in a different way and other philosophers think of it in
different way you had said that you understand this kind of causation that's operative in this argument as simultaneous not that causes precede effects but
it's a simultaneous relation can you just tell me in in terms that don't use that word exactly what that relation is well the way I would the way I would
explicate it is in terms of this Aristotelian distinction between actuality and potentiality and this is this is the way causation efficient causation
specifically one thing bringing another into existence bring another into being he is traditionally understood by Aristotelians and by Thomas followers of
Aquinas who build on Aristotle the idea is that you've got something that exists in only a potential way like the yellowness of the banana or the coldness of
the coffee set or the over the tea and the cause of the coldness or the cause of the yellowness of the of the banana actualizes that potentiality or
actualizes that potency to use the more scholastic jargon but I'll stick with the word potentiality so I understand causation efficient causation something
generating another thing as being the actualization of a potential okay thanks so I guess there's a couple of things to say about that I mean the first thing
is is that I'm not sure why I should believe that there are any potentials that are not actual so for instance before the banana is yellow there is no yellow
says the Pinar yellowness of the banana it's not as though I think there's any evidence that there are these potential things hanging around in the wings of
the universe waiting to come on stage there is nothing off stage the second thing is that your explanation I think that's still used used more dragon than I'm
comfortable with so you use the verb to actualize which doesn't seem to me to explain more than the verb to cause could you just say in plain English what it
is very to actualize B well let me answer these in order because I think the questions are related as I sort of just briefly alluded to the origins of
Aristotle's analysis here and what he's doing is replying to these pre-socratic philosophers Parmenides and Zeno and you know so so Parmenides for example
says change is not possible because if you think of say that the yellowness of the banana or the the coldness of the tea he says before before the the Ticos
gets cold the coldness doesn't exist right and so it must be something that's non-existent it must be an instance of nothingness or non-being and we have to
go therefore for the change to occur we have to go from nothingness or non-being to something but nothing can something can't come from nothing so changes in
illusion that's that's in a nutshell Parmenides idea so Aristotle's responses that well form is if you were correct that that's what change involves going
from nothing to something he says then I would agree that change is impossible but there's a there's there's a middle ground here between fully actual being
or full reality you might say and nothingness and that's where potentiality comes in its introduced by Aristotelian as a way to make sense of the possibility
of change that's one of the jobs it does it does some other jobs as well so a potentiality it's it's a reality so if you take if you take another example I
use in the book right you take a rubber ball that a kid melts in a microwave the reason the ball can melt in the microwave is because it's got the
potentiality for the squishiness or gooeyness it exhibits after it's melted and it has that potentiality even before it actually happens for Aristotelian
potentialities are something real they have to do their inherent in the very nature of the thing itself it's because there is a real potentiality there in the
rubber ball that it's able to be melted and even if the that never actually happens right suppose the ball sits in a drawer and it dissolves you know just
crumbles to dust over the course of the century and it's never actually melted it's that we it's still true counterfactually that had you stuck the ball in
the microwave it would have melted so there must be something real in the ball that accounts for that counterfactual truth and what the aristotelian calls
that is a potentiality that's the meaning of the word potentiality and so we need to posit such things as real features of the world in order to account for
the possibility of a change that's I guess you know one reason why we we have to affirm potentiality as well as actuality something in between actuality on
the one hand and nothingness on the other now that was attempt to answer your first point I came to what the second point was but I was trying to build on
that so yes it was to do is whether you've effectively answered what actualization is as opposed to causation yeah I was before vocalization is you use the
word actualization which I understand even less than causation do you want to tackle a second one as well well what causation as I say then is essentially a
matter of of actual actual izing what's initially merely potential and then you can think of the way for example that the heat of the microwave the heat in
the chamber of the microwave which is already actual say makes actual something which is otherwise merely potential namely the squishiness or the gooeyness of
the ball saying so caught what causation just is for the aristotelian is the actualization of a potential so you say the actualization yeah go ahead yeah I
was gonna say so our if your problem is both with this idea of potentialities that exists which are waiting to be actualized as it were and whether the
actualization does any other work than what we typically call a cause yeah so it's not so much whether it does any other work it's whether it's any clearer
than the world cause that it was supposed to be used to explain all right I mean we before we've got a couple of minutes before our first break so is this
your main problem with this argument or are there other things you want to know there's quite a few other things well I'm just wondering whether we should try
and tie this one up and then move on to some of the other issues on the other side of a quick break but just explain for us what what the main issue is then
in a bit more length with this very beginning point yes yeah so just to set in the context of the argument as a whole the argument was supposed to be there
there is this this you know the things don't things don't change or things don't get sustained in existence and those things actualize them from being
potentials being being actual and there can't be an infinite chain of these things so there's something must be something at the bottom of that sequence and
that's a thing which is supposed to be purely actual that's that's God and so my imagine was with the first step of the argument concerning why we should
believe in these own actualized potentials and what what even the word actualize is supposed to mean here so just returning to the things that Ed said about
that and the first thing is that you might think there are very many other things wrong with Parmenides is an argument they don't have anything to do with
having too too late I'll actualized potentials or any search so I can explain why you know a rubber ball melts or wire bounces by appealing purely to two
actual features of the rubber ball for instance to do with its coefficient to be elasticity to do with the hardest at the floor and to do with various other
laws of size that's a perfectly good explanation that as far as I can tell isn't isn't missing anything the second point is just to do with again the notion
of cause if cause means something like transfer of energy or if it means something like counterfactual dependence or something like that which is you know
then I can understand what's meant but if you explain the word caused by another causal verb like make actual then my concern is the same as Humes when he
says that people try to you explain the world cause using terms like force and making and power and other things but that's simply explaining unlike the you
know obscure things in terms of equally obscure things now the order English word cause as used in terms of temporal you know sequences in time is perhaps one
that you can assume familiarity with but of course the whole point is here we're using cause in this specific technical sense that's very distant from
ordinary use and that's why I think it's fair it's fair to insist upon some explanation in turn let's allow ed to respond to that in a moment time after a
quick break and we'll get into what else we can in terms of this first argument that we're debating on the show today the Aristotelian proof and we're going
to make time as well in the rest of the show for the rationalist proof as well debating five proofs of the existence of God that's the name of Idi fazes new
book and if you want to find out more about it too make sure to go to today's web page to find out so he's in conversation with atheist philosopher Arif our
met here on unbelievable you can read more and get in touch with me there at the web page premier Christian radio comm slash unbelievable and we'll be back in
just a moment time for over ten years as host of unbelievable I've listened to objections to faith from the world's leading skeptics and the most common
question I get is how come you still believe unbelievable the book is my answer telling the story of the show and drawing on hundreds of conversations with
atheists and Christians I explained why I still believe Jesus is the answer to life's deepest questions get your copy of unbelievable why after ten years of
talking with atheists I'm still a Christian an unbelievable book co uk you're listening to unbelievable on premiere Christian radio welcome back to the second
part of today's show we're dealing with some deep philosophical issues here and today on the show we're certainly asking you to put your thinking caps on you
may want to listen back to today's show if you're not following everything you can easily do that from our webpage but the reason we're getting deep into
philosophy today is that we're debating five proofs of the existence of God that's the new book by Ed feza he's a phaser I should say he's a Catholic
philosopher who teaches at in California and his latest book deals with what he believes are five of the strongest philosophical arguments classical arguments
if you like presenting them afresh in this new book and very much should presented in a way that is accessible for laypeople as well and Arif our medic joins
me in studio he's an atheist philosopher from Cambridge University been on the show a few times before and Di's them it's get having a you know a really
substantive discussion now on whether these arguments do stand up and and we're trying to cover the era stir to t the Aristotelian proof I'm really having
trouble with that one today and the rationalist proof today so just two of the arguments outlined in Ed's new book and so if you want to get in touch yet
again you can email in unbelievable at premier dot org dot uk' listen back to today's show get more info on the guests as usual from the webpage premier
Christian radio comm slash unbelievable where you can find lots of other resources connected with today's show so I want to give us as much time as we can to
continue this conversation so let's continue on the aristotelian proof this is the argument from the distinction between actuality and potentiality to the
existence of a pure actual actual Iser of the existence of things now that's a bit of a mouthful but we heard we heard that explaining in the first part of
the program and and then re few responding that you've got a problem with some of these terms firstly whether you can even speak of causes apart from a
temporal sense of a cause that wants to define causes as a sort of happening all in one moment and also this question of whether you can have potentialities
in the way that Ed describes in this so there's a couple of couple of things and we'll we'll just do another 10 minutes or so debating this one ahead and and
see if we can come to some of the other of the objections that Arif has to this one go ahead though ed yes I wanted to say a little bit in response to the
points that Arif made before the break and first of all he made a comment to the effect that the account of causation aristotelian account of causation that I
was describing involves technical terminology which it does it does involve some technical terminology but he also indicated that it was if I want to put
words in his mouth but I think the way he put it was that the Aristotelian account that I was giving is a somewhat of a departure from common sense whereas
the human account of causation it was closer to common sense and I would take issue with that I think it's actually the reverse so I think it's part of the
common sense notion of causation for example that when one thing in the world of our experience causes another when say the the cool air in the room causes
the tea to cool down or when the heat of the microwave causes the rubber ball to melt say that it's something in the cause itself that generates the effect
that there's a kind of built-in connection between these physical entities themselves and that's something of course that Hume denies Hume thinks that course
Hume thinks that causation is really not out there in the world or at least that we don't have any reason to believe that it is but it's something that the
mind imposes or projects onto the world and modern humans modern followers of Hume are in one way or other influenced by this picture of him and so they try
to define causation or I would say redefine causation away from the common sense idea that there's something in the causes themselves in terms of
counterfactual conditions or something like that but the Aristotelian analysis of causation tries precisely to stick to this common-sense idea that cause-and-
effect is a real feature of the world it's not something imposed by the mind that's something that Hume is forced into because of his distinctive epistemology
is distinctive theory of knowledge and his account of how we come to know things like causation or the existence of an object outside or minor what-have-you
and Humes starting points is his presuppositions about how knowledge works are contingent and challengeable and the Aristotelian would say that they're that
they're incorrect so that we're not forced to by the analysis of causation and human builds on those things and it's actually the more common-sense notion of
causation that's correct and then when the Aristotelian introduces this technical terminology is just meant as a way to kind of tighten up or give a general
characterization of what common sense means by cause so that's one point as I would I would challenge this idea that Humes approach to causation is the more
common sensical one I think it's there's the Keeling account it's actually closer to common sense and the other point I would make is that Arif made a point
to the effect that we could give an alternative account of what happens when say the tea cools down or or the rubber ball melts in terms of a scientific
explanation rather than an Aristotelian metaphysical explanation and that I would deny as well I think that the entities that and processes that a scientific
explanation makes reference to they really just relocate at most at best they relocate the context in which the actualization of potential is occurring there
don't really provide an alternative they simply provide scientific explanations I mean simply provide concrete details about how specifically the
actualization of potential goes in the case of tea cooling down or a rubber ball melting or what-have-you but what they don't give us as an alternative to an
account which involves the actualization of potential anything that the scientist makes reference to the Aristotelian philosophers going to say is going to
involve at some level of analysis the concept of the actualization of a potential so it's not really an alternative woman allow iris to come back but if you
would like to introduce another objection you'll be welcome to with what little time we have left on the Aristotelian argument Harry thank you Justin um yeah
so maybe I'll just very briefly say something about that and then mention another objection first of all in response to the first point that it makes I'd like
to distinguish between common sense language and common sense beliefs so what I was objecting to was the use of language that departed from common sense from
everyday language rather than an account that was at variance with everyday beliefs about causality I agree with Ed that Humes account is in some ways a
departure from common sense but the same thing isn't needn't be true of the modern philosophers that he describes as descendants of Hume so that for instance
a philosopher like David Louis gave of causation which makes it entirely objective and not at all mine mine dependence so it's not as though you know you can
be a human in one respect and yet not think that causation isn't an objective and real feature of the world on the second point concerning scientific
explanation I suppose here yeah I'm in some sense you know protesting the co-opting of a use of word explanation in this in this rather specific way it seems
to be a perfectly good explanation of phenomena in terms of either they're on to see their physical antecedents in using using laws of nature or perhaps some
kind of constitutive analysis of them using chemistry or other such things that seem to be what we know ordinarily regard as explanations if the Aristotelian
wants to use the word explanation in some other special way and say oh this isn't really an explanation this is something else he's welcome to do that but
here's an account of why we should care I understand that I'm sure ed would like to respond to some of those points but it would be good to maybe at least
draw out one more objection to this particular argument Arif so I'm gonna allow you the time to do that just for a minute or so and see what EDD has to say
and then we'll move on to the next argument yeah thank you so much again to put this into the context of the argument as a whole if you recall the argument
involved there being a sort of chain of things depending into some sense on other things for their existence and this chain can't have an end and sorry can't
conquer more forever and so we have to end it ultimately in God yeah so we have to upend it ultimately in God so another objection that I have is again
roughly human I suppose you might say which was that is EDNOS I'm sure Hume says it's perfectly possible for there to be something that just comes into
existence without any cause without any perhaps without any explanation in some more specific sense and it certainly seems to be something that we can imagine
and moreover it seems to be something in which no contradiction is involved but it is a premise and I think a crucial premise of the Aristotelian argument
that that can't happen so I wonder what he'd say in defense of that go ahead right so um I say a fair bit about human the book and as far as you know human as
Earth says has this idea that in principle something might come into being without a cause and he seems to rely there on a kind what contemporary philosophers
might call it conceivability argument so an example that I often use in the classroom is Hume seems to argue something like the following way that we can
imagine we can conceive with no evident contradiction of something like a bowling ball say suddenly appearing on an empty surface where nothing had been
before and of course we don't expect that ever to happen Hume Hume himself will be the last person who expected that whatever actually happened in real life
but he does think that it's possible to least in principle because we can conceive of it whereby conceive of that he means give a kind of description of it
that involves no evident self contradiction okay so it's possible in principle for this sort of thing to happen now I I think there are a number of problems
with this argument one of them is that Hume and this reflects his empiricist theory of knowledge humans thinking of concept conceiving is essentially a matter
of forming a mental image we form a mental picture as it were of a blank surface and then followed by a mental picture of a bowling ball suddenly being there
where it hadn't been before but whether conceiving something understanding what your intellect is really something the same thing as forming a mental picture
that's a contentious and I think false assumption that's doing some work here but more problematic is that the scenario that the human is describing I think
is is radically under described simply imagining a case where a bowling ball say hadn't been and then suddenly it appears is not by itself sufficient to to
imagine something coming into being without with without a cause we need to add more to this story for one thing simply imagining something without its cause
is not the same thing as imagining at having a note imagine it having no cause right so I can conceive of say Abraham Lincoln without conceiving of how tall
he was but it doesn't follow that Abraham Lincoln could actually have existed without any height whatsoever the existing realities got to have some height
even though I can entertain the idea of the internal of Abraham Lincoln without entertaining how the idea of how tall he might have been in the same way as I
can imagine a bowling ball coming into being without imagining a cause it doesn't follow that it could exist in reality without a cause that's one problem and
then a related problem is one that the 20th century philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe famous student of Icahn Stein pointed out which is that we need to
distinguish in a thought experiment like Humes the idea of something coming into being without a cause from its being transported from somewhere else via an
unusual cause like teleportation say so human asked us to imagine something coming you know the bowling ball suddenly appearing where there hadn't been one
before we need to ask well why is that a case of the bowling ball coming into being without a cause as opposed to simply being transported invisibly from
somewhere else via some exotic process and in order to answer that question answer on points out that our ordinary way of distinguishing something coming into
being versus being transported is in terms of its cause did it have a transporting cause order to have a creating cause but then we have to bring the idea of
cause back in in order to make that distinction so the whole where the whole point of human example is to try to get rid of the idea of cause so I would say
the human argument rests on thought experiment that are under described and when you add more detail to the story then you find that you have to bring the
idea of cause back in rather than just rid of it before we have a response from you or if just and I have read these respond to the point though being that
the if Hume had adequately described the idea of something coming to existence without a cause that would undercut the argument itself because you don't
therefore need an uncaused cause in the form of God if we could in in principle have some way in which causes could emerge without without having antecedents
and so on so that's so ok so where do you go with this because obviously it does rather depend on you know if you could have a an uncaused cause then we don't
need God yeah thanks I mean first of all I should say that this isn't something we observe in everyday life at all but in a sense that doesn't matter because
we're talking about very abstract things that we're talking about the foundation of the universe if you did observe it you would probably assume there is a
cause if a bowling ball appeared on the desk in front of me I wouldn't think that just popped into existence out of nothing I think where's Darren brown he's
if there's an illusion going on here typically in everyday life that's what we would assume we can't make these assumptions in fundamental physics and for
instance or and of course I agree with that that there is a distinction I'm forming an image of something and conceiving it you know it's worth drawing a
distinction between those things so I think the substantive issue is really whether the description something came into existence without a cause contains a
covert contradiction that is to say whether you can deduce a contradiction from it that would be what would settle that it was impossible and this in a way
goes back to my earlier comment because the way you can deduce contradiction that claim itself is logically consistent the only way you could show that it was
contradicted would be by analyzing the word cause in such a way that if formal contradiction became apparent so let me give you an example if I say mr. X is
married and a bachelor we all know that's impossible why do we know that because the word bachelor can be analyzed into a man who isn't married and perhaps
some other things and the claim that he's married and unmarried is it is a direct formal contradiction so we need some similar sort of argument to show that
the claim that an object came into existence without a cause u entails a contradiction without such an argument there's every reason to think that it
describes a possibility so what is that argument I'm gonna allow you to respond and then we'll leave it because I do want to move on to the the the second
argument before time runs out so at how would you respond and then we'll move on well I guess I would say I would make two points and the first is that the
first has to do with the question of the burden of proof so the human asks us whether we should believe that everything really does have a cause and actually
putting it that way everything has a cause is not quite the right way but that every everything that comes into being say has a cause and then raises
skeptical scenarios that are supposed to cast doubt on this but with with the what the human is doing there is asking us to doubt something in the context of
an argument for God's existence that neither he nor anyone else tends to doubt in other contexts in context of scientific explanation or ordinary everyday
common sense explanation so it seems like we've got special pleading unless the human gives us some reason to doubt it in the one case we don't don't doubt it
in other cases and if the if the reason for doubting it is supposed to be thought experiments like the bowling ball type of scenario then it's sufficient
until the human gives us some reason why we should doubt at one context rather than others it's sufficient to respond to the human eye say simply to point out
that arguments that depend on flawed experiments like that that one involved in the bowling ball fail for the kind of reasons that I mentioned earlier when I
appealed for example to Elizabeth Anscombe point so that's one point is I don't think the burden of proof is actually on the defender of the claim that what
comes into being requires a cause but rather on someone who's skeptical about that claim to human so that's kind of a negative point about who has the burden
of proof if we're asking for a positive argument for the claim that what comes into being requires a cause here I would appeal to something I guess we're
going to get into in the in the other argument were going to talk about there the rationalist proof i would appeal to a version of the principle of sufficient
reason if we suppose that things could come into being without a cause that we'd be violating this principle that everything is intelligible that there is a
reason for anything that exists in any event that occurs there is some reason that makes it intelligible why it happened that way rather than some other way
or rather than not at all rather not existing or happening at all so that the the principle of causality as it's called this is a good way of maybe getting
into the second argument and I appreciate the week we do have to do waste or stop at some point to the to the rebuttals in each direction but I really
appreciate the the tone and the substantive nosov of the discussion that we've had there on the aristotelian proof anyone just joining us by the way we're
debating five proofs of the existence of God on unbelievable this afternoon with Edie phasor who's the author of that new book and we're just taking two of
those arguments and trying to squeeze in a bit of a debate here on the show between him and Eris are met who's an atheist philosopher at Cambridge University
we are asking you to put your thinking caps on today though because this stuff involves diving deep and if you do want to listen back again you can do that
from the website at the podcast and so on but yeah we've got about another 10 minutes or so on this side of another break to to get into the second of the two
arguments we're looking at today on the show Edie the rationalist proof do you want to give us a a brief summary of that particular argument and we'll see
what Arif has to say in this in this one sure so the rationalist proof is it has that name because it's famously associated with rationalist philosophers like
live it's German early modern German philosopher Leibniz also with the English early monitor philosopher Samuel Clark so I defend this proof though the way I
would defend the argument against certain objections would would differ in some ways with the way a bit aliveness or a Clark would defend it because I'm a I'm
an Aristotelian in a tome as the follower of Aquinas rather than a rationalist in the strict sense so but putting that putting that sort of qualification or
complication aside the basic idea of the rationalist proof is that it starts with what I referred to earlier as the principle of sufficient reason which tells
us that for any thing that exists for any event that occurs there must be some reason or explanation why it's the way it is rather than some some other way
there's some way to make it intelligible there's some explanation now we may not always know what the explanation is but there is objectively as a matter of
fact later we can discover it or not some explanation or way of making intelligible the things that exist in the world around us and the idea is that this is
a principle that we apply in science in everyday common-sense reasoning and explanations and in philosophy what the rationalist proof suggests is that if we
push through consistently however what's entailed by the principle of explanation we're going to be led unavoidably to the existence of a divine cause of the
world and the basic idea and you see this famously expressed in live notes is that the the things.when of all of our experience our contingent they exist but
they did not have to exist they could have been otherwise the desk in front of me exists but it could have been otherwise have the desk manufacturer never
come into being it wouldn't be here and contingent things therefore because they could have been otherwise we need some explanation of why they're not
otherwise why they exist when they could easily have not existed and even if we appeal to some other contingent thing like the existence of a desk maker that
just kicks the problem back a stage and indeed even if as Lightman says we we take this series of contingent things one contingent thing being caused by
another which is caused by another all the way back into the past and and without any sort of beginning if we suppose that the world of contingent things has
always been here we still have the question of why there's any world of contingent things all rather than nothing or why it's this world of contingent things
even if it's instantly old that exists rather than some alternative world of contingent things and if we have if we appeal to some higher-order contingent
reality or to explain that then we're just kicking the problem up to you to get a higher level the only place the buck and stop as it were then is with
something that's not contingent but exists in an absolutely necessary way something that not only exists but could not possibly not have existed and then when
you unpack the idea what it is to be a necessary being in this way the argument is that you can pull out of this concept all of the traditional divine
attributes something that's outside of time and space is in material is am nipa ttan a mission and the whole ball of wax but the idea is that nothing less
than this will fulfill the requirements of the principle of sufficient reason that things are ultimately intelligible or there's a way to make sense of them
or explain them so it's it's another argument which draws on the idea of having to stop an infinite regress in a sense but in a different way this time that
it's about this idea of the contingency of everything else that appears to exist requiring an explanation for its existence whereas the only way you can stop
that that infinite regress is with something that requires no expiration resistant cities has necessary existence in that sense so yeah where do you want to
begin with this one very well in one thing that I had said in his very clear summary of the argument was this science presupposes this principle that
everything has an explanation now I think it's true that scientists look for explanations of things and we too in ordering life look for explanations of
things if that means for instance a statement of its efficient cause or a statement of some reason that somehow could bring it about right it needs other such
thing that we would normally call an explanation but the mayor practice of looking for explanations doesn't entail that one is always there to be found indeed
it seems to me the most plausible thing in the world that there are some things we'll never understand nor can I see that any scientific theory that I know of
entails that everything has an explanation unless it has a particular one in mind so I'm wondering what exactly the evidence is that science doesn't just
proceed by looking for explanations but actually entails that the PSR is true the PSI the principle of sufficient reason and everything must have written
certain acts an explanation yes go ahead right so what I would say is that yes I did say that science presupposes it and philosophy and and common sense do as
well and so far as they're all in the business of explanations and that and if you're looking for an explanation that presupposes there's one there to be
found the question though as well does this entail that we have to believe that strictly everything has an explanation and what I would say is it's it's not
any particular finding of science not any particular theory in physics or chemistry or psychology or or any other of the special sciences that that show us
that the principle of sufficient reason is true what I would argue instead is that the very practice of looking for explanations in general really makes no
sense unless we supposed that things in debt that that everything does have an explanation let's we commit ourselves to the the PSR the principle of
sufficient reason and one reason for saying this is that if we deny the principle of sufficient reason if we deny that that everything has an explanation then
we're going to be led into a kind of incoherence we're going to be led to at least an implicit conflict with our practice of looking for explanations so for
example we normally take to be the case that the reason why we arrive at certain theories in philosophy or in science the reason why we accept certain ideas
and claims is because we have good reasons for them that there that's where the evidence leads us that's where the best arguments lead us so we believe that
the reason we accept certain ideas has to do with the proper functioning of our rational faculties and the proper functioning of our our sense organs and so
on and so forth if the principle of sufficient reason is false though if as a matter of objective fact things need not have an explanation there may be no
rhyme or reason for why things happen the way they do but that might be true of our rational faculties themselves and our perceptual apparatus itself it may
be that the reasons we believe things have nothing to do with the fact that they are rational or that they are supported by the evidence of our sin it might
be that we believe them for reasons that that for which there's no rhyme or reason whatsoever and it only seems to us as if they're well supported by
arguments or well supported by the evidence of the senses so if we if we're consistent in denying the principle of sufficient reason they're going to be
forced into a position we'll have no reason to trust our own rational faculties or perceptual apparatus and so so I rewrite by casting doubt on it effectively
undermines the whole process of rationalism and and that that's going to be a problem a quick response Arif and then we'll go to a break and we'll have
another ten or fifteen minutes to to continue the conversation thanks yeah no I think that that claim is just just plain false I think that one can perfectly
well trust one's senses and Trust scientific inquiry is long one things for instance that almost everything has an explanation that can make more justified of
being highly confident in one senses and of course science itself never deals in certainties or gives us 100% knowledge it only gives us this or that
probability so there's no reason why one shouldn't believe something significantly weaker than the principle of sufficient reason or at least weaker enough as
to undercut the argument for the existence of God that we're looking at while still thinking that science almost certainly in almost always gets us to the
truth as to our sense of sense organs we'll go to that break now and let you respond to that ed in just a moment's time we do a tackling here an unbelievable
two philosophical arguments for the existence of God as outlined in ED phases new book five proofs of the existence of God this second one the rationalist
proof looking at the idea of whether we have to have a necessary being like God in order to guarantee the existence of all other contingent things that exist

digest and also to listen to conversations like today on with our if a mate who is an atheist philosopher at Cambridge University and responding to some of
the arguments in Ed's book so when we we got to the point both gentlemen where we're talking about whether the this principle of sufficient reason that Ed has
talked about necessitates a necessary being and so that we have we don't have an endless chain of causes or indeed the the contingent existence of things has
to have something that stops that infinite regress so in that last section edie Arif was as offensively saying I can still assume that the majority of the
time there are reasons you know for things happening in science and so on without having to assume that there has to be this necessary existence sort of at
the very kind of bottom of everything in that sense well where did you want to go after that yeah so so our argument was that we needn't be committed to the
full PSR the full principle of sufficient reason in order to make sense of the practice of science that you could you could believe that your senses and
rational faculties are reliable or reliable enough to get scientific inquiry going and to be able to trust the results of at least an attentive way the
results of scientific explanation without believing that absolutely everything has an explanation now the problem I see with that is I think it's ultimately
on analysis going to try to be question begging it's going to beg the question against the sort of argument I was giving earlier because if we're going to say
that our rational faculties and our sensory apparatus our sense organs so forth are reliable and then suppose we say well the reason we think they're reliable
is because we have such and such evidence from common sense we have such and such evidence from neuroscience or cognitive psychology or what-have-you well
once again we're going to be doing the very thing that I described earlier we're going to be supposing that the evidence that the neuro scientific or
cognitive science arguments make reference to is reliable evidence that our sense organs got things right in providing us with the evidential base to to
develop those theories or that the reasoning process we use to get from that evidence to our theory was a reliable bit of reasoning that's going to presuppose
the reliability of our cognitive faculties in the very act of trying to argue for the reliability of our cognitive faculties that's already a kind of
circularity but it also involves exactly the sort of problem I described earlier is that it assumes that the reason why we believe these things about what
cognitive science tells us or neuroscience tells us what have you has to do with the fact that there's good evidence in its favor or that the sensory evidence
and so forth is reliable but it might be if the principle of sufficient reason is false that the reason why we believe these things has nothing to do with
actual evidence or with the operation of our cognitive faculties and it only seems to that there's really no intelligibility at all to the way we arrive at
our beliefs so I think that this attempt a sidestep my earlier argument that you're letting the incoherence if you deny the principle sufficient reason is
ultimately going to be circular or it's going to miss the point of the argument as I as I put it elsewhere that someone who denies the principle sufficient
reason is really committed to the idea that their brute facts in the world there's there are some things that are completely unintelligible but that you can
somehow limit this and I want to say you can't really limit it that being you know it's like being a little pregnant you can't have just a little bit of
Brutus in the world or brute facts in the world it's either all going to be intelligible or all intelligibility goes out the window a quick response and then
perhaps let's move on to another of your objections before time time escapes us yeah thank you I suppose my responses that I just didn't see why why those
claims should disturb someone first of all it's perfectly true that if someone doubted all of my comment even families including my rational faculty I
wouldn't be saying be able to say anything to convince him otherwise that kind of radical skeptic is not someone I think you can defeat but I don't think that
anyone should care about that that matters and certainly doesn't stop us from conducting the activities of everyday life or science so I'm not clear and not
you know clear what what the what the argument is for the incoherency if it's anything other than we couldn't rationally justify from absolutely no principles
at all why we ever trust anything or believe anything scientific enquiry doesn't proceed in that way we always take some things for granted in order to do
other things the second the second point is just that and again says that if we were check the PSR then it might be true that these are Brut fats that were
encountering it might be true that we've got no of course it might be true that all kinds of things are consistent it might be true that trees start talking
tomorrow the question is do we have any reason to think it's remotely likely and if we think for instance that the PSR is true almost always in our experience
but there's no reason to think it's true everywhere and a hundred percent and at all times then that seems to me a perfectly consistent position because it's
not both with with the evidence of the senses with rationality and with the conduct of science and everyday life I will let you put your second objection now
before time thank one's out Harry thank you well if you had a couple of things to say so I have to decide which of the things I want I want to talk about so I
suppose one thing concerns that this really is to put it again in the setting of the armed general structure of the arguments we've been seeing or ones that
involve a kind of regress and the regrets has to stop somewhere and the thing at which the regress stops has a different feature from all the things that took
us down the chain towards it in the first place so one the issues that I have with this argument concerns the impossibility of an infinite series and the idea
was supposed to be we couldn't have an infinite backwards sequence of explanations because then we would never really have explained anything well argument
seems to me to presuppose that in order to explain anything you also have to explain the explainer and that statement I think is false I can explain for
instance the results of the u.s. presidential election last year in terms of facts about the campaign that preceded it but that's a perfectly good explanation
or it might be that doesn't itself stop working simply because I haven't also explained the facts of it explain the difference between the campaign's that
preceded it so if we drop that principle that to explain something you also have to explain the explainer then it seems to me that there's no reason at all
why we shouldn't have an infinite regress okay so what about an infinite regress is arif how do you responded right so where the question of innocent regress
is concerned there are two basic kinds of regress we're talking about here their causal regresses and then their explanatory regresses so let me just say a
little bit about each of those though they are closely related I think so where causation is concerned you have a distinction traditionally drawn in in
Aristotelian philosophy and in writers like Aquinas between what I call in the book a hierarchical causal series versus a linear causal series and and and the
kind of regress that writers like Aquinas and Aristotle are concerned with is the kind that I call a hierarchical kind of causal series which Aquinas
illustrates with the example of a hand which pushes a stick which in turn pushes a stone and the idea is that the stick can push the stone but not under its
own steam it has power to push the stone only insofar as it derives it from the hand and the hand in turn derives it for me but I'm not deriving my power to
move other things in the same way that the stick is nobody has to pick me up in order for me to go ahead and move the stick the way that the stick needs me to
pick it up in order for it to move the stone so the idea is that in that kind of causal series the reason why it has to work back to a first member is that
the later members in the series have no causal power on their own they're on their own they're causally inert and so they causal power only insofar as they
borrowed from something else and so you can't have borrowed causal power without something to borrow it from and this kind of causal series the Aristotelian
argues ultimately has to trace to something which has causal power in an in a built-in or inherent way rather than a derivative way otherwise we wouldn't have
the causal series in existence at all that's why we need to get to something that's unlike the other members of the series when we're talking about causation
so in the Aristotelian proof that I gave earlier at the beginning of our discussion the idea is that here we have a kind of causation the actualization of
potential and the reason why you need to get to something that could actualize without itself being actualized is precisely because we have this kind of
hierarchical causal series with the other members have no causal power unless they derive it from something that has the causal power in a built-in way and
that would have to be in something that can actualize without itself being actualized so that's one point and I maybe I'll pause here in case we want to pick
up that discussion we come up to the other kind of carries it was this the kind of causal sequence that you had in mind in terms of what what you don't feel
it would have to be terminated at some point in the way that obviously it feels it does have to be in order to to be able to speak coherently about mm-hmm
well I took it that the argument we're looking at now involved an explanatory sequence rather than a causal see oh yeah but I will say something about this
which is that again it seems to me to be false to say that you know if a causes B & B causes C then B doesn't have a particle C without a so if we take for
instance if I throw a stone at a window and the window smashes and the Smashing of the window causes somebody inside to jump then the smashing sound of the
window is itself has the power to cause the jumping whatever caused it whether it was a stone or something else so I think the example of the stick is
somewhat misleading in that connection it can certainly be true that a can cause B and B can cause see and that means that B really does call C it's not that
it causes it in some second-rate way or in derivative way it really does cause C all will task and after then is the cause of B so I don't think that argument
works for causation but in any case think this argument is really directed at the explanatory regress rather than the causal regress but maybe similar points
would come up for the right yeah so that's fair enough so real quick what I would say about that about the first point are if made is that the the scenario
he's describing where this stone has thrown at the window then the window shatters and then the noise causes an effect and someone who hears the shattering
and so forth that would be an instance of what I refer to in the book is a linear causal series rather than a hierarchical one and one difference here is that
linear series are typically extended forward and backward in time where as hierarchical series have to do with simultaneous causation here and now and at any
particular moment so while he's right about that example it's not an example of the specific kind of causation I had in mind and what I said that that's one
point but he's also right that we're talking about something a little bit different when we talk about the the rationalist proof so what I would say about
that about the issue of explanatory regress is basically this that one way to approach it is this that when we give a an explanation in terms of a scientific
sort for example we're typically appealing at least in part to laws of nature and then we have to ask well how do the what explains the laws of nature suppose
we're explaining something in terms of Kepler's laws of planetary motion and then the response as well we can explain those as a special case of more general
laws like Newtonian mechanics and then if someone says yeah okay but what about Newtonian mechanics how do we account for that and we the answer would be well
that's a special case of a more general theory I'm steins relativity and we could take it down to some basic set of laws and then we've reached at least for
the sign tip for the philosophical naturalist we've reached the bedrock of explanation but of course the Aristotelian philosopher or the Thomist is going to
say yeah but those fundamental laws themselves could have been different so why aren't they or why do we have a law governed universe at all we need to
explain explain those and then of course that's part of the argument that takes us to see ISM according the rationalist proof so order to get around that the
naturalist is gonna have to say well when we reached the the fundamental laws of physics say we simply have to take those as given we have to take those as a
brute but that that doesn't rob the the higher-level laws of their explanatory force but I would deny that I would say that well look if the higher-level laws
are really just special cases of lower-level laws then if you derive the lowest-level laws of it any intelligibility you say they're just the brute fact the
fundamental laws of physics are just a brute fact and the higher- level laws are just special cases of them well if the bottom level are just a brute fact and
unintelligible then that really means the higher-level laws are unintelligible as well as I put it in the book it's kind of like you know to say that we can
explain things by taking them down to deeper and deeper levels of laws but we get to the deepest level we say that's just a proof fact without any explanation
that's like putting a book on a shelf so that it doesn't fall putting the Shelf on some bracket so that they don't fall but then hanging the bracket midair
where they're just gonna collapse we really robbed the what will originally seem like an explanation of its explanatory force ok so funny enough this whole
talk of brute facts came up in a recent cosmological episode when we were talking about these very ideas about whether you can have a brute fact and that was
Sean Carroll who's a science popularizer in the USA said yes I do have essentially a brute fact but it's just you know you've got your brute fact in God and
so we've both got a brute fact at the end of the day but for you presumably in this case Edie God is not the same kind of a brute fact as the naturalist who
says all the fundamental laws of the universe are a brute fact because what what would you want to tell us quickly before Eris responds yeah god I would say
God is not a brute fact and the reason he's not is that God's God's existence is explained by his own nature he's you could say self-explanatory in that way
he's not self caused causations a different notion here but he is self-explanatory in the sense that it's the very nature of God spelled out by the
Aristotelian in terms of the idea of his being pure actuality with no potentiality or in the case of Thomas Aquinas say he would say God's very essence just
is subsistent existence and so forth of course that requires some unpacking but the idea is that the divine nature itself explains the existence of God so we
don't have a violation of PSR here we just have a different kind of explanation than we having the kit in the world of contingent things okay do you want to
talk about brute facts at this point Arif will work where do you want to take your federal response here and we've just got a few minutes left so we will
start wrapping things up that thank you yeah that's really helpful I mean there's there's a couple of things I guess I want to say about that the first thing
is that if we grant what you I think you're saying which is that any chain if any chain of explanations just bottoms out and brute fact then at no point then
none of the points in the chain where explanations in the first place I mean if that's what we're going to say then the argument looks kind of question
begging for because one of the reasons for believing the principle of sufficient reason in the first place with that we do find that things have explanations
in everyday life and in science but of course if by explanation you mean big explanation that doesn't bottom out in brute facts there's no evidence that is in
question begging that we ever find those things in science for everyday life so then I would start to question the premise that we have prima facie evidence
for the for the PSR and then the other point was that the sort of rejection I was getting out wasn't really an attempt to defend that view though I think it
is perfectly defensible but rather an attempt to ask what the contradiction is in this claim that everything is explained by something else that claim which
is presumably you can allow for an infinite chain of explanations isn't obviously inconsistent unless there's some notion of explanation you have in mind
whether it be causal or deductive nomological or some other kind of statistical or some other sort of explanation from which you can derive a contradiction so
I guess there's the two things I want to bring up at this point well we are more or less out of time I'll give you a cheap quick chance to respond and we'll
we'll have to leave it there and maybe take and well continue it in the pub metaphorically speaking later on but yes how do you want to finish things up here
well I guess it's very briefly then I would I would say that I I'm not sure that I see the ground for the charge of circular reasoning or more question
begging on the part of the defender of PSR here the way I put it a few moments ago was that if we're going to take higher-level laws like Kepler's laws say or
Newtonian mechanics the laws of Newtonian mechanics as special cases or as approximations of deeper level laws that's really what they are then if the deepest
level laws are simply unintelligible and the other law are just special cases or approximations of them that it's hard to see how those higher-level laws can
be failed to be unintelligible as well in which case they're not really what we initially thought they were when we were appealing to them as an explanation
it's a kind of bait and switch I think that's implicitly going on unintentionally of course but that's going on when the naturalist ultimately wants to
introduce Brutus or failure of explanation at the bottom level I'm not sure what's question begging about that whether or not one that wants to reject it for
some other reason we do have to call it a day there I apologize because I'd love to have continued it for longer but time is beating us and all I can say is
you guys just have the most razor-sharp minds and I mean that because you've carried this on for over an hour now and and need both of you have just been
absolutely on top of it and so I take my hat off my thinking cap off to both of you but thank you very much for coming in and spending some time with us Arif
thank you very much and thank you Ed for being on the line more details about both my guests from today's website premiere Christian radio comm slash
