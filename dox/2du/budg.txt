 104.20   82.20 remainder (which she's been adding to my savings)

I still do have the significant $176 storage expense until I can go get my stuff && I've stopped my drum lessons too, so maybe it should now look like:
         new
        1500    total income
        -425    rent
        -258    cash (still $60/week)

           3    remainder
Once utility bills arrive, we can re-calcul8 but for now Maga has:
        -215    cash ($50/week)
        -275    groceries
        -150    utilities
 && the rest the same with basically the same remainder.
