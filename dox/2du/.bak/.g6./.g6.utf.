  There's also strong inclin8ion to continue employing my traditional editing conventions, which might be better to l8r avoid for less bl8ant ID assoC8ions;
I really like RagingGoldenEagle's reversal idea of making some gr8 game && then selling the censorship as extra DownLoadContent, keeping FanService quality;
Tangentially rel8d to MGTOW stuff, I have found some good criticism of attempts to add Pedophilia as part of LGBT intersectionality as just another inherently
  valid form of "love". They use MAP (Minor Attracted Person) && attempt to normalize it sympathetically from the Gay playbook, draw distinctions from actions
  which are criminal Child Sexual Abuse, paint them as marginalized victims, etc. which I cannot get behind, but similar post-puberty Hebephilia is a maybe;
Regarding ACallForAnUprising, TheFuelProject, && maybe TheWhiteRose discussing Pedophilia as emerging from rampant s8nism, && assoC8ing every form of possible
  symbolism from every X or star of body or background, as well as possible hand signs of Peace or Okay, as indic8ive of deliber8 Black Magic occult s8nism,
  I think there may be such rel8ively secret significance in many of these possible cases, but insisting they are all always purposeful seems ridiculous too;
I agree with TurdFlingingMonkey that men must have both responsibility && *authority* over women && children needing protection. Now that women increasingly
  usurp the authority away but still insist on holding men responsible, maybe women will need to give up or have their rights revoked in some adequ8 fashion;
Also discussing credibly superior replacement systems for Democracy and majority-rule voting will need to be considered && maybe UBI (Universal Basic Income)
  is infeasible && unsustainable in ways similar to Communism && Socialism, even if autom8ion increases demand for it, but still should be evalU8d carefully;
Regarding the notion that Holocaust figures likely dramatically infl8d or otherwise fabric8d 6 million as prevailing accur8 approxim8ion of the total number
  of Jews killed in concentr8ion camps, it is curiously coincidental if Poland also claims to have lost 6 million citizens to Nazi && Russian military forces
  && probably increasingly suspicious if the same number of Jews was regurgit8d many other times prior to WW2 for claims of suffering in Russia && elsewhere;
Joe Rogan also has an insightful discussion of Alex Jones just getting deplatformed && how he was right about Bohemian Grove secret elites burning of Molech
  in effigy as well as World Trade Organiz8ion protest infiltr8ion likely by government plants && many other conspiracy theories that he may be right about;
I am also inclined to agree with TFM && DDJ regarding free public college through Financial Aid or paid-for training, it makes sense to tie those to pursuit
  of educ8ion in a field that is sufficiently "in-demand" && likely enough to be worthwhile to yield a hireable candid8 after curriculum has been completed.
  DDJ points out "pay your way" && trade unions funding lucr8ive apprentice training. TFM talks about a new insurance program which is a "sister program" to
  traditional unemployment insurance which can provide for some needs for "continuing educ8ion" or other programs which would equip people to adapt to work;
I8AMM8MT:DDJ on MisandryToday channel talked sternly to TradCons && Anti-Feminists critiquing allowing defeat && demise of MRA's, also entreating them along
  with other RedPillers (beyond MGTOW) to destroy Feminism... && presumably re-align most essential particip8ion systems to recalibr8 against exposed abuses.
He also described LoveDolls as a beneficial altern8ive to real problems with women && the present clim8. I almost imagine learning && coding together enough
  to contribute to && help new AI simul8 LoverBot && many other potential categories, types, && capabilities for diverse prospective companion expressions.
Further totally identifying && rejecting prevalent applic8ion of unjustified Duluth Model as acceptable to make distinctly credible assessments of gendered;
I8BMBGod:While I think Anti-Theism && gradual popul8ion emancip8ion from religion is usually generally a good thing, I can also fathom somewhat peculiar &&
  rather conspir8orial scenarios where a massive number of FreeMasons && EasternStar Wiccans (witches && warlocks, or wizards) start coming forth all around
  the world to deflect, distract, deny, or dismiss credible claims that a majority of these secret orders actually behave in calcul8d ways which broadly seek
  to deceive, desensitize, defend, then normalize worship of s8n, Lucifer, Baphomet, Devil, etc. as "Bringer of Light && Love" clouding over ritual sacrifice
  && blood ceremony, after animals or humans are slain in wicked offering. If they can be revealed && it confirmed significant numbers of them are s8nists,
  Pagans, Wiccans, etc. who conduct any atrocities like cannibalism, abduction, murder, pedophilia, slavery, sexual abuse, torture, involuntary mutil8ion,
  blackmail, clandestine coercion, corruption, conspiracies, cover-ups, && other incivility which threatens peaceful society, then possibly postures favoring
  engagement with such circumstances from more of a Judeo-Christian Pro-Theism perspective might prove more effective than basing response around Anti-Theism
  when the worshippers of evil may have regressed to believe in both the Judeo-Christian God && s8n, concluding, convinced, or controlled to think the wicked
  latter is gr8r than the former. So they might be said to be extra levels deep in the bad-f8h underground pred8ory crypts && tombs from even more primitive,
  sinister, && antiqu8d religious beliefs, but then if such a purportedly awesome s8n figure proved out to be imaginary, impotent, or inept, these over time
  might progressively rattle the secrecy away from the hideous black-f8h of all who have fallen for traps && come to believe in && worship s8n as their Lord;
I8BMCAPF:Old NoelPlum description on CA8 Oct8th2012 of 3 distinct Atheism+ groups, with forums infiltr8d && moder8d in SocialJustice && essentially Feminism;
I8FMI2du:Someday it might be wise to read CompariTech.Com && research altern8 advice on securely setting up the best available FreeSoftware packages providing
  anti-rootkit, tripwire, firewall, && anti-virus services for GNU/Linux. May also be good to research OpenVPN, OpenConnect, AnyConnect, && NetworkManager
  before paying for ExpressVPN or some similarly top-tier subscription service for loc8ion anonymiz8ion (hopefully), && then spin off new sepR8d identities.
  Also an old note regarding what the first G in GGOW could usefully stand for is: GenrGentGuyGamerGalGrrlGuruGeekGreekGoodGodGerardGhostGhoulGanefGyreGr8ful;
I8FMMtip:HTTPS://YouTu.be/xC5xAc42yvc is 11 minutes of Sandman presenting a whole lot of valuable investment advice about companies && industries to consider;
I8GMFAGA:While watching YouTube tonight, I saw a lame-looking thumbnail with a title indic8ing some figure identified FaceBook, Apple, Google, && Amazon as
  the Four Horsemen (of the Apocalypse) && I realized that F.A.G.A. is like Make America Gr8 Again, but instead possibly Foment Absolute Global Armageddon;
I8GMGWAY:It should be good to research l8st of Festival && altern8 TTS mechanisms, revisiting the best techniques to gener8 normalized && humanistic subtle
  varE8ion && inton8ion. Also study vocal obfusc8ion techniques && contempl8 the best approaches to me cultiv8ing simultaneous disguise && worthwhile persona.
  Probably explore just Audacity with old microphones && video cameras to synchronize audio before delving into BlueYeti, even though Dad seeks my true voice.
  Maybe it would be wiser to practice personal A/V work, but experiment priv8ly && w8 until arriving at sepR8 mobile phone && afforded solid VPN to upload;
I8LMBroP:Concentr8ing on KeePass d8abases && encrypted layers of identity isol8ion, protection, security, obscurity, significance, etc. && which may need to
  prolifer8 quite a bit depending on threat models, convenience, loop-hole vulnerabilities, && other factors, but staged old entrenched memorized insecure
  passwords could progressively unlock increasingly complex randomized longer rel8ively secure obscure newer passwords, or just hints or memoriz8ion assisted
  non-sequitur layering (usually actual word-pairs wrapping older better-known familiar reliable onion layers of lower resulting phrase length complexity).
 Another interesting notion is autom8ing the discreet sepR8 gener8ion of some 4096 (2 b64-character indices) padded encrypted d8a with fixed-size .kdb. files
  that can be used to index a large set of tree structures for simple bucket references to be available to reference for accessing more revealing error hints
  to remembering broadly the passes of deeper layers && db host:path loc8ions connected from this one, as well as ideally an independently configured overlay
  of increasingly secure && connected access to stages of interactive memoriz8ion assistance && varied strategic construction, alter8ion, propag8ion, rot8ion,
  etc. techniques for solidly autom8d, partially gener8d, or manual 4 or 5 die6 rolls or around 10 to 13 coin-flips at a time to obtain all PGP-verified d8a.
 Consider calQl8ing memorable methods for meticulously shuffling a standard deck of cards or set of uniform RPG dice probabilities in order to promote how
  many iter8ions each would require to particip8 in cryp random entropy sources to index word d8a lists (each offering shallower ordered varE8ions). It should
  also be good to provide utilities && default new install8ion configur8ions which interject a bijective transl8ion mapping of random new local redirections;
 Maybe also sepR8 utility to distinguish best parameter options to auto-purge certain patterned command history or even v e b u encountered very priv8 files.
 Also consider having some integr8d layering for enabling secretive personaliz8ions based on particular dur8ions, such that say the hour is after Midnight or
 Noon, Day of Month or Week of Year is even or odd, today is WeekEnd or WorkDay, up to Day of Week is Sun0..Sat6, etc. which possibly modulo rot8ingly remap
  most common word junction characters, probably usually assuming '.' best default, '_' underscore, '-' dash, '+', plus, '=' equals, ':' colon, ';' semicolon,
  ',' comma, '/' slash, '\' backslash, '"' double quote, "'" single quote (apostrophe), '`' backtick (left quote, grave accent, or push), '~' tilde, '|' pipe,
  '!' bang, '@' at, '#' pound, '$' dollar, '%' percent, '^' caret, '&' ampersand, '*' astarisk, '(' left paren, ')' right paren, (for block of shifted normal
  U.S. keyboard number row, 1..9 then 0) so that successive layered security stages can provide an orthogonal dimension of sized sets of rot8ion from key2key;

I8RMLGCC:HTTPS://YouTu.be/vs4nh7fPZp8 "Another Woman Trying To Stop MGTOW?" # 11m12s of SandMan breaking down false equivalence arguments of MGTOW are RadFems
 but the amazing part is the sometimes lucid && other times unintelligible results from taking the below supposed auto-transl8ion of transcript into Dutch,
 then auto-transl8d back into English. Some of it could be deliber8 && crE8ive, even if there weren't interpret8ional biasing in gener8ion process. Actually
 much of it is obviously directly authored English that certainly is misrepresented as auto-gener8d (since at least significantly annot8ion upd8d). Altern8:

00:00 a lot of people have a sense that a felt       09:30 individual level a new basis for               20:07 life and a lot of happened right
00:08 sense that things are starting to break        09:34 identity values our own individual sense       20:09 there was a lot of physics and chemistry
00:10 down do you sympathize with that and how       09:37 making choice making as long as I think        20:10 and cosmology happening you could say
00:13 would you sort of sum up what that means       09:38 that I'm an individual that is                 20:13 based on that it's probably that there's
00:15 if we look at the history of the thing         09:40 fundamentally separate from you and the        20:16 never gonna be this thing called life
00:18 we call civilization to date one very          09:42 biosphere and everything else I can            20:17 because forecasting from the current
00:21 obvious thing that we notice is that all       09:43 think about optimizing my own quality of       20:19 curve it would seem like we've run all
00:23 the early civilizations don't still            09:46 life independent of and maybe even at          20:21 the combinatorics right and then life
00:24 exist whether we look at the Mayas the         09:47 the expense of your quality of life for        20:23 emerges and then there's about a billion
00:27 Aztecs the Egyptians the Roman Empire          09:49 the biosphere or anything else as soon         20:25 years where there's just single cells
00:30 the Greek Empire the they all collapsed        09:51 as I get that I start to say okay well         20:26 and it seems like a billion years is a
00:33 and so the precedent is actually that          09:55 I'm not that tree but what would I be          20:28 really long time to figure stuff out
00:36 civilization collapses not that it             09:57 without trees why would not exist right        20:29 they're not gonna be multi cells it's
00:38 maintains the real difference is that          10:00 well there would be no atmosphere if           20:30 actually when the single-cell creatures
00:42 this is the first time we have a               10:02 they weren't plants photosynthesizing so       20:32 are at a phase shift of near
00:43 completely global civilization there           10:04 I fundamentally am not even a meaningful       20:34 self-induced extinction that leads to
00:46 really is no such thing as USA or China        10:06 concept without plants so if I think of        20:36 the environmental pressures that lead to
00:48 separate from each other when you              10:09 myself as me that is not fundamentally         20:37 multi cells and you know one narrative
00:49 understand globalized materials                10:12 interdependent with plants I'm actually        20:39 of how that happened
00:52 economies technology economics where           10:13 just not even thinking clearly right           20:41 so it's kind of the nature of universe
00:54 there's actually no country in the world       10:15 it's just a bad ontology it's a bad            20:43 to do unprecedented stuff right that is
00:56 that can make its own consumer                 10:16 semiotic s-- and then I start to run           20:47 kind of what evolution means is that new
00:57 electronics right without the mining and       10:19 that and say well what about soil              20:48 epochs are unprecedented saying we need
01:00 manufacturing and you know technology          10:22 microbiota and what about and it turns         20:51 a miracle but we have miracles in the
01:02 that happens from around the world so          10:25 out that my life depends on the whole          20:52 post I'm saying we need an epoch shift
01:05 our process of civilization is one that        10:28 thing right so I am really I can be            20:55 it is not the continuation of the
01:08 has inherently self terminating dynamics       10:30 better thought of as an emergent               20:56 current curve that is a discrete
01:12 built into it when that happens at a           10:32 property of this whole thing right not         20:58 nonlinear phase shift and that if we
01:15 fully global scale it is a basically the       10:34 just a biosphere because what would it         21:02 think about it as just continuation of
01:19 catastrophe is just unbounded where it         10:35 be without the Sun and so as long as I         21:04 current curves okay these things are
01:21 has always been bounded as big as the          10:40 have a sense of AI that is separate and        21:05 getting better with tech let's just hope
01:22 Roman Empire was when it fell it wasn't        10:42 maybe even rival ris'n rival risk              21:07 they keep getting better it doesn't work
01:24 everything and limited by not only its         10:43 competition for some scarce status             21:09 and so but if we say what are the
01:27 total geographical size but the level of       10:46 resource attention partner or whatever         21:14 necessary and sufficient criteria of a
01:30 Technology it had it caused                    10:48 it is then we have a fundamental basis         21:16 civilization that doesn't self germinate
01:31 desertification throughout the noble           10:51 for war and in a world of exponentially        21:18 in the presence of the emerging power we
01:33 agriculture but it wasn't able to              10:54 increasing technology which means that         21:21 can actually identify what those
01:34 destabilize the biosphere writ large in        10:56 the warfare gets to be more and more           21:22 criteria are and they're actually things
01:37 a hundred years of industrialized              10:57 consequential that will self terminate         21:23 that we can do then that becomes the
01:39 fishing we've removed most of the large        10:59 so rival risk dynamics multiplied by           21:26 only mo that makes sentences working to
01:41 fish species from a water planet right         11:03 exponential tech self-terminate                21:28 bring that about but then looking at the
01:43 at 3/4 water planet took three and a           11:04 exponential tech is inexorable we cannot       21:31 current political climate looking at the
01:44 half billion years to get those fish           11:07 put it away so we either figure out anti       21:33 current kind of the leaders that we have
01:45 species and so you recognize that we're        11:09 rivalry or                                     21:35 at the moment do you have any hope that
01:49 operating the same way that has always         11:10 we go exceed you an experiment comes to        21:37 they are going to be equipped to bring
01:51 led to war and environmental destruction       11:12 a completion that's like that's the core       21:38 this about of course not because the
01:53 and collapse of civilization just              11:14 thing figuring out anti rivalry is a           21:44 they are part of the system that is
01:55 factoring exponential technology and so        11:17 psycho-spiritual process inside of             21:47 obsoleting itself do you have a sense of
01:59 when you start to think about                  11:19 ourselves can we actually even get along       21:49 how that shifts then if they can't do it
02:00 exponential rivalry rivalry dynamics           11:21 with our family members can we pay             21:50 I'll say things that everyone has
02:03 that lead to polarization that ends up         11:23 attention to our emotions and triggers         21:52 probably heard when Bucky fuller
02:05 leading to war but now exponential             11:25 that hijack us from sovereignty because        21:54 famously said don't try to fight the
02:07 warfare it becomes larger than a finite        11:27 the moment I'm getting pissed in my            21:56 existing system or fix it just build a
02:10 biosphere can handle and it becomes            11:28 value system is not to be an angry             21:57 new one that obsoletes it that it has
02:11 existential when you think about               11:29 person I'm actually hijacked right can I       21:59 the right characteristics it's very much
02:12 exponential extraction the next one            11:32 pay attention to that and actually have        22:01 that when we think about the the kind of
02:15 pollution which means depletion and            11:35 some sovereignty over my own inner state       22:04 caterpillar to butterfly metamorphosis
02:17 accumulation from open loops in a              11:38 and how I show up in the world and can         22:06 inside the chrysalis it's not a
02:19 network diagram you go to an eco system        11:43 we figure out how to do that                   22:08 caterpillar or a butterfly it's goo
02:20 there are no open loops every thing is         11:44 collectively as well but that was my           22:09 right and that goo phase that liminal
02:22 the food for something else there is no        11:46 question how do we give people a sense         22:12 phase
02:24 unknowable resource no waste our               11:48 of that connection beyond themselves to        22:14 the caterpillar is actually dying right
02:26 civilization is characterized by               11:52 give them a felt sense of their                22:17 because the caterpillar doesn't just
02:28 materials economy that's linear not            11:54 connection to that to the natural world        22:18 lose weight and grow wings if you look
02:29 circular so toxicity is depletion on one       11:56 and to what they depend on so an               22:19 at it the the caterpillar has a genetic
02:33 side accumulation on the other whether         12:02 important thing to understand about Homo       22:23 code to go gather parts right to gather
02:35 we're talking about on the depletion           12:03 sapiens that is different than all the         22:26 minerals and amino acids and sugars that
02:38 side whether we're talking about species       12:05 other species as far as we know is you         22:28 are going to then be reassembled into a
02:39 extinction or biodiversity loss or any         12:09 look at a horse and it's up and walking        22:31 butterfly if the if we were just looking
02:44 of the issues that we look at there and        12:11 in 20 minutes and it takes a human a           22:34 at the caterpillar and we didn't know
02:46 on the accumulation side whether we're         12:14 year to walk and you think about how we        22:36 it's gonna butterfly and we were looking
02:47 talking about co2 levels in the air or         12:17 can be helpless for that long                  22:38 at its getting bigger and it's eating
02:49 in the water or nitrogen runoff or             12:19 evolutionarily right like think about          22:39 everything it's not pollinating anything
02:51 degraded uranium or whatever else it is        12:20 how many 20 minute segments go into a          22:40 we would predict that it eats itself
02:53 those are all specific instantiations of       12:22 year to think about how many multiples         22:42 into extinction except at a certain
02:57 open loops in the way we do civilization       12:24 of helplessness that is and even a             22:44 point it gets rich enough blood
02:59 in relationship to the closed loop             12:26 gorilla or a chimpanzee can hold on to         22:46 chemistry that it triggers this movement
03:01 dynamics of the ecosystem that both have       12:28 its mom's fur in the first few minutes         22:47 into the chrysalis it starts to dissolve
03:05 a civilization that is increasingly            12:30 and we can't move our head for three           22:49 it gets reorganized at a you know amino
03:06 fragile and that is making increasingly        12:31 months we're like okay we are born super       22:53 acid level into something that now
03:09 fragile underlying ecosystem is                12:33 in the autumn this or fetal for a very         22:55 pollinates the plants that the
03:11 basically debasing the substrate upon          12:35 long time                                      22:56 caterpillar decimated across these vast
03:13 which it depends and so when you think         12:35 and the reason is because all the other        22:57 spaces and helps the evolution of the
03:15 about exponential extraction exponential       12:37 animals evolved to fit an environmental        22:59 whole system
03:18 pollution that obviously gets larger           12:39 niche we are niche creators who went to        23:00 the butterfly phase could not have been
03:20 than the playing field can handle when         12:41 the Arctic who went out to the islands         23:02 predicted from the caterpillar phase and
03:21 you try and think about exponential            12:43 who went to the desert who we were able        23:05 the so if we look at capitalism in the
03:22 expansion of the monetary supply that          12:45 to create niche adaptation everywhere          23:08 military industrial complex and all
03:24 has to be based in goods and services          12:48 and then we made new niches like cities        23:10 those systems as gathering parts right
03:26 that can't keep happening when you think       12:50 right and so we couldn't come with a           23:14 very much like the caterpillar was net
03:28 about we compete using narrative and           12:53 hardwired program for how to be adaptive       23:15 consumption very much like a fetuses in
03:32 information when you start to think            12:55 to a certain environment we had to come        23:17 utero the fetus couldn't go past 40
03:33 about exponential information tech used        12:57 not hardwired learn what the environment       23:19 weeks 50 60 it dies and the mom dies but
03:35 for disinformation and for population          12:59 was because it used to be super valuable       23:21 it also couldn't come out much earlier
03:38 control you get to a place where the           13:01 to throw Spears now we don't throw             23:23 because it wasn't ready to make a phase
03:41 information ecology is so broken that          13:03 Spears that mantri text into other             23:25 shift it comes out when it first can it
03:43 what's actually happening with North           13:04 things so we have to actually be able to       23:29 has finally evolved to the place that it
03:46 Korea or not are we going to have              13:06 soft wire that means that we are               23:30 can actually do breast milk rather than
03:47 nuclear war what's actually happening          13:09 radically more affected by our                 23:32 get food from the umbilical cord
03:49 with Syria what's actually happening           13:11 environment than all the other creatures       23:33 directly but it also comes out when it
03:50 with Putin's relationship to the Trump         13:13 are - and not just in childhood but even       23:35 has to there's a fairly narrow window of
03:52 administration how long do we really           13:15 into adulthood and with neuroplasticity        23:37 transition the same is true for an
03:53 have before all the coral die-off like         13:18 we are continuously being affected by          23:38 animal developing inside of an eggshell
03:55 all the most important questions as to         13:21 our environment so when                        23:40 or a there's a finite amount of
03:57 whether we make it or not as a species         13:23 you think about that our whole                 23:41 resources and when it runs out it has to
03:59 nobody really knows how to make sense of       13:26 evolutionary history was in ecosystems         23:43 emerge but that's also the first time
04:00 and so when you have a situation where         13:31 that we depended upon where we were            23:44 that it can emerge that system can
04:04 you've actually got an exponentially           13:33 being well the complexity of nature the        23:46 handle the transition so we see in
04:06 decreasing sense-making capacity right         13:37 self-organizing dynamics of nature was         23:48 nature this kind of precedent that these
04:09 an information ecology that is                 13:38 what our nervous system was taking in          23:50 discrete nonlinear phase shifts because
04:11 increasingly more broken with an               13:40 and getting an intuition for and then we       23:53 there's a curve of in utero and then
04:13 exponentially increasing capacity to           13:43 grow up not connected to any complex           23:54 there's a shift and then there's a curve
04:15 make big choices right technology is           13:47 system nature to a little bit of               23:56 outside but that discrete phase shift
04:17 basically a lever of our choice making         13:48 manicured nature that's about it and all       23:58 have come through the birth canal is
04:19 so a fist has one level of harm and I          13:50 man-made structures that are complicated       23:59 different than either the phase before
04:22 extend that to a stone tool it's a             13:52 not complex they're all fragile you            24:01 after so when you're asking like or any
04:23 bigger harm to a bronze tool to a gun at       13:54 bring this house down                          24:05 of the caterpillar is going to be able
04:25 the level of an ICBM that's just a             13:55 it doesn't repair itself you burn a            24:06 to do the pollination thing it's the
04:27 really big extension of that type              13:56 forest down it does you damage this            24:08 wrong question right like the the
04:28 choice-making capacity but when I have         13:58 camera it doesn't repair itself you cut        24:11 problem that we see is the caterpillars
04:30 exponentially increased choice-making          13:59 me I'll repair myself so we don't even         24:12 are eating everything that's true and
04:32 capacity with exponentially worse sense        14:02 have an intuition for what nature is or        24:15 and that is to gather the resources that
04:33 making that always runs into a cliff and       14:07 what complexity is or what                     24:18 get assembled in a fun for a
04:36 so the underlying dynamics that are            14:09 self-organization is because we haven't        24:20 fundamentally different set of reasons
04:40 leading to the self-determination that         14:10 spending time around it and we are that        24:22 it's if we say how do we maintain
04:42 people feel and sense right now are not        14:13 conditioned by what we're around now           24:25 strategic competitive
04:45 different in kind than the ones that           14:14 younger generations are growing up with        24:27 that's what the leaders are trying to do
04:47 we've been facing since the beginning of       14:16 almost their entire life from their            24:29 leader of a companies trying to maintain
04:48 what we call civilization they're              14:18 earliest neuroplasticity is                    24:30 strategic competitive advantages grants
04:49 different in magnitude and in the speed        14:19 two-dimensional right and that it              24:32 the other companies a country is across
04:52 of process factoring the exponential           14:21 responds to them in a way that doesn't         24:34 other countries but of course the moment
04:54 curves involved and what is it because         14:23 have physics it has some other                 24:36 you have some sorts of asymmetric
04:58 some people talk about the shift being         14:24 pre-programmed in physics so there isn't       24:37 advantage and you deploy at everybody
05:00 we can talk about intermit irreal terms        14:26 even an intuition for how physics works        24:38 sees it reverse engineers it makes
05:03 or we can talk about it in terms of an         14:33 so all of that is a preface to say             24:40 modifications on it and you just up the
05:05 evolution in consciousness or the way          14:36 reconditioning a felt sense of our             24:42 level of rivalry for the entire playing
05:07 that we operate what do you sense is           14:39 connectedness with everything is not           24:45 field that itself is what is terminating
05:09 that leap that we need to make in terms        14:41 actually a trivial thing to do it's a          24:49 the seeking of strategic competitive
05:11 of how we operate you actually have to         14:43 it's a deep process and there's a              24:51 advantage the the rival risk dynamics
05:16 think about it on all of those levels to       14:48 cognitive development that people can          24:52 because that is what actually self
05:18 be able to make sense of it in a               14:50 start with which actually matters which        24:54 terminates with this level of power so
05:19 meaningful way otherwise it's kind of          14:52 is as soon as you just really think            24:56 it's how do we take all the
05:21 like asking when we are talking about          14:56 about it and think about who am i              24:57 technological capacity and start to use
05:23 the health of a person whether that            15:00 without plants and Who am I without            24:59 it for something that is not trying to
05:24 means the health of their liver or their       15:03 pollinators and you realize I don't            25:01 have power over but to have strength to
05:26 kidneys or their blood it's like that          15:05 exist and you start to get that the that       25:04 not be deformed by other power and be
05:27 doesn't even make sense you can't              15:08 there is this kind of narcissism that          25:07 able to be anti rivalries and etc so if
05:28 separate those things from each other so       15:10 we're stuck in almost all the time             25:12 there's a society we're going from this
05:30 when I think about what economics is           15:12 thinking about me I and it's not even          25:14 sort of idea of the caterpillar to the
05:33 economics is our value system codified         15:16 it's not even a good thought it's like         25:17 butterfly does that mean each individual
05:37 as value equations that determines how         15:19 it's not even a rational way to optimize       25:20 person has to go through that same shift
05:39 much we value one thing relative to            15:21 my own life let alone the fact that it         25:21 and if so what does that mean well how
05:40 another thing that determines what we're       15:25 creates depression just thinking               25:24 does that look individually yes as
05:43 incentivized to do and what we confer          15:28 cognitively about the interconnectivity        25:29 families and small groups of people yes
05:45 power to so if a dead whale is worth a         15:29 of everything actually helps a lot how         25:33 as communities villages tribes larger
05:47 million dollars on a fishing boat and a        15:32 to get a more embodied sense                   25:38 groups of people yes all the way up to
05:49 live whale in the ocean is worth nothing       15:36 go spend time in nature do psychedelics        25:40 everybody so individual and collective
05:51 that's a value system codified in a            15:38 do any kind of state practice that             25:45 sense making in choice making process an
05:53 value equation that then incentivizes          15:41 creates expanded States see how you can        25:47 individual is necessary but it's not
05:54 behavior but it also incentivizes              15:44 have more intimate relationships with          25:49 sufficient if you have a bunch of people
05:56 psychopathology right psychopathy              15:46 more people all those things and when          25:52 that are making sense on their own they
05:58 actually I have to shut empathy down           15:50 you sketch it out like that it seems           25:54 can never make sense of the complexity
06:00 because leaving the whale in the ocean         15:51 immense the challenge are you are you          25:55 of the whole world if they don't figure
06:02 it I hope she isn't even gonna stay in         15:55 hopeful or are you pessimistic I think         25:56 out how to have meaningful collaborative
06:04 the ocean another guy's gonna hunt it          16:00 that the shift that we are on the              25:58 dynamics to other people and if they
06:05 out right so I've got a tragedy of the         16:04 precipice of is not like the shift from        26:00 have collaborative dynamics with some
06:07 Commons so I have to kind of deaden to         16:10 the Dark Ages to the Enlightenment or          26:01 but then not others and they get into a
06:09 be able to do the thing that is                16:13 even the Agricultural Revolution it's          26:03 competitive dynamic than the others
06:11 incentivized by the system or somebody         16:16 like more like a shift from single cell        26:04 figure out how to disinfect so we either
06:14 else does and I'm just not effective in        16:18 to multicellular life it's like a really       26:08 figure out anti rivalries Omni
06:15 the system so you can't think about the        16:21 deep fundamental shift in the level and        26:11 collaborative type dynamics or we cap
06:18 evolution of human consciousness and the       16:23 type of complexity in the nature of            26:13 out at a level of collective
06:19 evolution of economics differently but         16:26 reality that we're talking about               26:15 intelligence less than we need so as
06:21 if you look at the way economics then          16:29 evolution brought about rival risk             26:19 individuals saying okay on my own I
06:22 needs to protect its own profit stream         16:31 dynamics but then it also brought about        26:24 don't know how to change macroeconomics
06:24 in the way it will learn how to                16:34 our prefrontal cortices our capacity for       26:27 I don't know how to create whatever the
06:25 influence media to control people's            16:37 abstraction and our ability to do design       26:29 post democracy governance system is I
06:28 sense making frameworks in the way it          16:39 and technology Lions can't make                26:31 don't know how to make a closed-loop
06:29 will influence governance again this is        16:43 themselves radically more capable as a         26:32 materials economy what can I do to it
06:31 getting to consciousness or the way it         16:46 predator in a very short period of time        26:34 least be starting to become a citizen of
06:33 will influence legislation on the nature       16:48 faster than the gazelles can get away          26:39 the future world myself
06:35 of what happens in education to prepare        16:49 right if they could they could eat all         26:42 one thing I'd say is stop trying to win
06:37 people for the work force and so the           16:52 the gazelles and then go extinct because       26:47 at the dying game and not just the dying
06:41 paradigm shift is basically                    16:53 they debase the substrate upon which           26:51 game but the game that's killing
06:44 everything we need new systems of              16:55 they lived and so as the great whites          26:52 everything if you're still trying to win
06:48 governance if we just I mean we think          16:57 getting a little bit faster the seals          26:53 at that game like you can't also claim
06:52 about how much we love the word                16:59 are also getting faster right the whole        26:58 to take seriously anything meaningful
06:54 democracy and we love the word democracy       17:00 system is Co evolving so there are no          27:00 that's one thing and then also don't
06:55 because it's better than tyranny and           17:02 radical power asymmetries we start             27:04 just get stuck in being angry or
06:59 it's better than the other like really         17:05 modeling ourself as an apex predator but       27:05 hopeless or just your own personal
07:01 horrible systems that we've experienced        17:07 then developing tools that increased our       27:07 development and go off to a Lotus Eater
07:02 at any scale but when Winston Churchill        17:10 ability to do that on an exponential           27:09 thing like actually be dedicated to
07:04 said democracy is the single worst form        17:11 curve when the environment wasn't              27:12 progressively better figuring out what
07:06 of governance ever created save for all        17:13 increasing its capacity to deal with           27:14 you can do to make a new game it works
07:08 the other forms what he was saying that        17:14 that on an exponential curve that self         27:16 for everybody it sounds like there's a
07:10 was really insightful was that getting         17:16 terminates so that's evolution modified        27:18 kind of almost spiritual dynamic to it
07:12 lots of humans to agree on anything is         17:21 by technology we need something that is        27:20 in terms of getting past one's own ego
07:14 just a hard thing to do and we suck at         17:24 neither of those things to be able to          27:25 if you can't get along with your family
07:16 it and we've never actually done a good        17:28 take the next step and you know one way        27:33 members and your ex-partners and you're
07:17 job at it and this is a really flawed          17:30 of talking about it is evolution is an         27:36 pretty sure that you're right about
07:19 system now we like it because like we          17:33 unconscious process rights an                  27:37 things and they're wrong about things
07:22 said it's overcoming things that were          17:35 algorithmic process of which species           27:38 and you think you have any idea of how
07:23 even more problematic if you think about       17:36 survive and reproduce and it's extremely       27:41 Israel and Palestine can get along or
07:25 democracy for a moment and whether we're       17:40 slow and most things fail what makes it        27:43 how the US and China can get along you
07:27 talking representative democracy or            17:42 through though has a profound degree of        27:44 are just silly and so you really don't
07:29 liquid democracy using a voting currency       17:44 complexity                                     27:49 get to even have a idea about politics
07:31 or binary vote fundamentally of a              17:47 design is a much faster process but we         27:53 if you don't actually know something in
07:32 process of saying okay we can't get            17:51 always build things that optimize for          27:55 an embodied sense around how to deal
07:35 everybody to agree beyond a very small         17:53 some number of functions that we               27:57 with differences and how to yeah how did
07:37 number of people Dunbar number tribe you       17:55 intended to talk to minus four but they        28:01 how to do real conflict resolution so it
07:40 can get everybody degree because they          17:56 affect more things than we intended to         28:04 sounds a bit Jordan Peterson clean your
07:41 can all be in a conversation together          17:58 optimize which usually is an externality       28:05 room pay attention to what you can pay
07:42 beyond the level of which you can have a       18:00 there's some you know harm or wasn't           28:08 attention to before you try and fix
07:44 conversation together you can have a few       18:02 intended evolution by design is                28:09 anything else foundations or foundations
07:46 people control everything and they can         18:08 something that is different than just          28:12 those are important so the other
07:47 be in a conversation together some type        18:10 technology design where we're designing        28:15 critical thing is that you can't assume
07:49 of oligarchy or meritocracy but then           18:12 complicated systems and it's different         28:18 that other people are going to fix these
07:51 you're like no we want most of the             18:14 than complex design that is unconscious        28:19 issues and you can just kind of chill in
07:52 people to agree at least right that            18:16 there's a process by which we can think        28:20 the world will work out that also
07:54 seems like a good idea but somebody puts       18:20 of it mythopoetic terms and say the            28:23 doesn't mean that you should freak out
07:57 forward a proposition to do something          18:22 evolutionary process kept increasing           28:25 and go into it existential angst on
07:58 that they think is important based on          18:24 orderly complexity until we got to the         28:27 hyperdrive without knowing what to do
08:00 their limited sense making that is never       18:27 capacity for abstraction that could            28:29 but to progressively lean in more and
08:01 everything that proposition because it         18:29 contemplate evolution itself and look at       28:32 say okay there's a path or we can make
08:04 wasn't informed by comprehensive sense         18:31 the principles of evolution see what           28:37 it but it's not a given at all that we
08:05 making will always in the process of           18:33 it's doing and choose to consciously           28:38 do yet rather than ask whether we do or
08:07 benefiting something also damage               18:34 participate within mediate evolution           28:41 not how do I help determine that we do
08:09 something else and so some people love         18:36 itself and so then we get to move from         28:43 how can I engage and that will require
08:11 it based on if what it's benefiting is         18:39 we have the possibility of moving from         28:46 learning a bunch of that you don't
08:13 directly relevant to them and other            18:40 being parts of the whole that are              28:48 currently know and that maybe nobody has
08:15 people hate it based on if what it's           18:43 competing with each other but moving to        28:50 synthesized well yet and that's what
08:16 damaging is relevant to them you just          18:45 having power that makes that no longer         28:53 being in imaginal
08:18 created inexorable polarization because        18:47 possible to actually being agents for          28:54 in the transition from caterpillar to
08:21 you made shitty propositions and then          18:50 the whole because we can't model               28:57 butterfly really means is taking some
08:23 ask people to vote yes or no by an Arri        18:52 ourselves as apex predators when we have       28:59 empowered responsibility for being
08:25 on a shitty proposition so you notice          18:54 the ability to extinct whole species           29:01 someone who's recognizing that you can't
08:27 people actually don't all get to               18:55 rule and whole biospheres make new             29:04 just run the instruction manual that was
08:29 contribute to the sense making of what a       18:57 species like that's no longer an               29:06 given historically and the new
08:30 good proposition would be there's no           18:59 adequate model the only thing in nature        29:07 instruction manual doesn't exist yet and
08:32 kind of collective input there there           19:03 that has the kind of ubiquitous power          29:09 it's actually the time of people in that
08:34 isn't even a generation of what would          19:05 that can make species and destroy              29:12 liminal phase is to work on developing
08:35 good mean here and they so really even         19:07 species and change the geography is            29:14 what is what are the new structures what
08:41 their choice making is just yes or no on       19:09 nature itself but now consciously              29:17 does that look like for an individual to
08:43 a frame that was already controlled and        19:11 mediated through agents that have kind         29:18 learn like if they say if someone
08:44 typically who's going to be able to even       19:13 of woken up as that so I think this I          29:21 watching this would say okay right I
08:47 put forward a proposition as someone who       19:16 think this next shift is us realizing          29:22 need to learn stuff what are those
08:48 has vested interests and so you're stuck       19:19 that as technology it results from the         29:24 things that we need to learn well some
08:52 with polarization in that particular           19:22 our abstraction but focused on parts and       29:26 people might have a very clear sense of
08:55 system right                                   19:24 not focused on how the whole thing fits        29:28 in the picture of all that needs done
08:56 so we need new systems of governance           19:26 together as technology is kind of giving       29:30 working on the future of Education and
08:58 that are not any system of governance          19:29 us the power of gods we have to get the        29:32 how to facilitate the development of
09:01 the world has ever done so far there are       19:32 love and wisdom and understanding of           29:34 young humans to be healthy sovereign
09:03 systems of how do we individually and          19:33 gods or we self-terminate with that            29:37 humans is really their focus and there's
09:05 collectively make sense of what's going        19:35 power that's a big task I don't think          29:39 certain things are going to focus on for
09:07 on make sense of what we actually value        19:39 that we can say that anything smaller          29:40 that or health care or the new materials
09:10 and how those values can be                    19:42 than that could possibly be adequate you       29:45 economy or whatever it is if one is
09:12 synergistically satisfied rather than an       19:45 didn't say whether you think we were           29:48 wanting to become comprehensively more
09:15 a theory of trade-offs with each other         19:47 likely to make it on up I think that if        29:50 educated about civilization changes
09:16 progressively better and how do we             19:50 you were to let's take the standard            29:53 needed writ large pay attention to the
09:18 create design that are optimal                 19:52 narrative on evolutionary history and we       29:56 people in this video that you resonate
09:21 synergistic satisfiers so that's totally       19:56 say okay there is no life in universe          29:58 with and go find more of their work and
09:23 new thing governance wise we need              19:58 till                                           29:59 then pay attention to the footnotes in
09:25 totally new systems of economics we need       20:00 started on earth three billion years ago       30:01 problem
09:27 totally new systems of Education               20:02 so you've got billions of years right          30:03 [Music]
09:28 healthcare all the way down to at an           20:05 ten plus billion years where there's no        30:16 you;

00:00 hi it's the 28th of October 2018 at 5:30       07:33 judge them judge what's coming out of          15:02 you try you out you could try them down
00:05 p.m. today is a background as comes from       07:36 their out of their brain because it's          15:05 online
00:09 an ID here from mr. bonejack                   07:39 the hearing comments okay I will judge         15:06 yep that won't take them long don't
00:10 it's a beauty isn't it it's a it's a           07:43 them I don't know you've all who they          15:10 worry about what they look like or
00:13 train ride in Switzerland as that scene        07:45 say are they like judgmental people what       15:11 anything else like that just see how
00:16 we just looked gorgeous when you're            07:48 I think those when they say that isn't         15:12 they see what's coming out of their
00:17 allowed to be there it might be having         07:50 that like pre judgmental people that is        15:14 brain see what's coming out of you so
00:19 cup of coffee go or you know a nice meal       07:54 people who judge you before                    15:16 you know there's a bitch but what you
00:20 blast while I'm just watching the world        07:57 get out you do things now this living in       15:19 just see oh yeah but you know nah you
00:22 go past I didn't love to do that yeah          08:03 service and I think the importance of          15:22 don't want okay so okay then you know if
00:25 but anyway that's I enjoyed and thanks         08:05 and I think this is very important to          15:27 anybody will say you know if I say that
00:27 mister valchek I think is a good idea          08:07 start thinking about if you are of the         15:29 you're judgmental just say yes what do
00:29 it's a really really good idea some time       08:10 opinion that either speak to women full        15:31 you want me to be you see what I'm
00:33 ago that Griff our sort of suggested           08:12 stop sooner or later I think what would        15:35 driving it yeah we have to inspire them
00:36 that I do a introduction the video I           08:17 happen is somebody will not want you to        15:37 and we have to start thinking forward
00:39 think you know what it is you're trying        08:18 all right or whatever and say oh you're        15:40 which they have to start thinking what
00:41 to do and what what it is you're trying        08:22 run it seems that you prejudge women you       15:42 would you do how would you react if
00:43 to achieve on the channel alright I            08:25 know you you are prejudiced against            15:45 somebody put you down why wait until you
00:46 agreed with him that it was a good idea        08:27 women and that word for that is misogyny       15:50 get there to start thinking about I
00:48 that I should do that but I had to be          08:32 and I think you will find that misogyny        15:52 don't think about it ahead of time what
00:51 honest I didn't really I couldn't              08:35 will be deemed a hate crime okay I'm           15:55 how would you behave is somebody abused
00:52 clearly say what was I was trying to           08:40 just putting this as plain and bluntly         15:58 you verbally what would you do maybe we
00:54 achieve and to a large extent I still          08:41 as I possibly can so I would start             16:04 maybe we could do role-playing exercises
00:57 can't you know I still I still can't say       08:48 thinking and this is what I'm doing is         16:06 on the channel but the whole point is
01:01 what it is I'm trying to do here but           08:50 start thinking of just how what I am           16:08 you know what we're actually doing as
01:03 what I've noticed recently and what's          08:53 imagining somebody saying you know             16:10 men as it is you know going along yeah
01:06 becoming more and more obvious is I'm          08:55 what's your attitude toward women and          16:13 everything's happy until it isn't you
01:08 doing a variation of what I did in the         08:57 I'll say it's very different to men I          16:15 know and bang where it erupts and then
01:11 pub I heard 28 30 years ago something a        08:58 talked to them and I engage with them          16:17 once you're in it you're in dragged into
01:15 back then I were just finished at the          09:02 but I listen to what they say and their        16:20 the dark side and you're in there you
01:19 futures market I was drinking heavily          09:05 actions and and what's in their mind           16:22 know finding out scratching and clawing
01:20 and just really all over the place but         09:07 I'm very judgmental I judge them I judge       16:24 arm with them the better that we
01:24 for some reason I found myself you know        09:12 males and females I'm also not mean I'm        16:26 actually start thinking forward amis are
01:26 sometimes on the weekend I've I've even        09:17 very strict I used to be laid-back let a       16:28 thinking okay so what happens in this
01:28 uneven there was a Shearer's pub you           09:21 lot go but I've now become very very           16:30 situation what would I do
01:30 know shearing sheep so you know they're        09:24 strict I won't put up with and he sort         16:32 how would I behave so that when you get
01:34 all young guys and I'm you know                09:27 of put-downs ridicule anything I mean he       16:36 that you sort of you mentally prepare
01:36 sometimes the guard just buy them a gig        09:29 didn't care was joking if I suspect            16:37 you know okay it's happening yeah okay
01:38 you know 50 layer cake and we sit around       09:33 they're just joking on so I'll actually        16:41 so and then you and then you react in a
01:41 drink all and then I they spend money          09:34 say is that joking                             16:43 certain way that that takes command
01:43 after that they in drinks but we just          09:36 are you joking and if they continue on         16:46 actually that the that puts you at least
01:45 sit around have a drink and you know get       09:39 basic no that's it I have no further I         16:50 at least you may get dragged down into
01:47 in the mood and they don't ah Godfather        09:42 don't want to know you                         16:52 the dark side no I think I think we've
01:51 you know that gets so hopelessly drunk         09:43 that goes for verbal abuse I've been           16:57 really got a really start thing we've
01:54 and do all sorts of amazing crazy things       09:46 abused so many times here I just don't         16:59 got to stop the old ways where we didn't
01:56 as I really really drunk and back in           09:48 talk to about walk straight past them          17:01 think at all let's face it particularly
01:58 those days I was okay to serve drunk           09:50 and they you know they can't understand        17:03 and I'm sure any of you baby boomers
02:00 people yeah there was no glory instant         09:53 you what's his problem                         17:06 right
02:02 and I hate just that's and then they do        09:55 well yeah it'll be use me so back in the       17:06 you didn't really think it through you
02:05 all sorts of things but                        09:57 park back in those days I was okay             17:08 had nobody to guide you nobody took to
02:06 through the week I'd come in and we'd          09:59 because it was pretty relaxed so you           17:10 suggest ideas dear you know it just
02:09 had more even more drinks and I'd sort         10:01 gotta have the abuse you could have all        17:13 dived into this bloody stupid pool you
02:12 of regurgitate to the more feedback to         10:03 that and you can overlook it but they've       17:16 know had that dumb arse bucks party and
02:14 them what I did the crazy things they          10:05 changed the rules but they want to keep        17:19 all the crap that went with her you know
02:16 got up to it and I used to love hearing        10:07 all the negatives and where strung up          17:21 into a fit and that's how a really
02:19 about it I was always very careful to          10:10 with nothing so what I'd like to suggest       17:23 serious decision was treated you know
02:21 leave the bad bits out you know I never        10:13 to you is start thinking about how you         17:27 it's if you look back on it it's crazy
02:24 ever put them down laughed at them you         10:15 are with women with guys for that matter       17:29 what we agreed to and what and the way
02:26 know humiliated them in any way I'll           10:19 and what I do is I look at it I don't          17:31 we did things and the way we thought
02:28 just tell them what a wonderful time           10:25 look at tits or ass or any of that I'm         17:33 about things and that's probably lies so
02:31 they all had                                   10:30 not interested or how pretty the face is       17:36 because you know people had their soul
02:33 because I couldn't remember yeah I             10:33 out most of the time I don't even see          17:38 of everything I'll be all right and I
02:37 didn't tell each other in poets but but        10:35 the face or the body okay I simply get I       17:40 know the truth is it's not more like
02:38 it was always good and it's always done        10:39 get something come through in comments         17:42 we're seeing that now it's not all right
02:40 in good spirit and carries them come           10:43 and I react to it and and I look at it         17:45 it's it's a very difficult decision to
02:41 back so so it cost me a little bit for         10:45 and I each comment and if one's negative       17:48 make and I could well understand why
02:44 the king of me but I made my yeah my           10:49 nasty you know put down complaining and        17:51 nobody would go there but all I'm saying
02:46 money back plus a little profit through        10:52 sort of thing about me I just ignore it        17:52 to you is don't leave yourself open for
02:47 the week okay little thinking that's           10:54 has no impact whatsoever that's it I           17:56 someone so eggy
02:51 kind of what I'm I'm doing here I'm            10:56 ignore it                                      17:57 you're a misogynist and you want to have
02:53 taking all of your ideas or as many as I       10:57 I live with Al and I don't ignore the          18:00 your answer ready for the mate now a
02:56 can you know I can think about and Olga        10:59 person or anything else either I just          18:02 misogynist is is a man who is prejudiced
02:59 I'm not even wearing glasses like you          11:01 skip over it I don't respond to the            18:04 against women ok I'm not prejudiced
03:01 know Grif suggested you know can you get       11:03 comment now if somebody's decides me in        18:08 against women no I
03:03 rid of the glare of their glasses              11:08 the future what's your attitude toward         18:10 I talked to women I live in date women
03:04 there's only two ways you can do it do         11:09 women are that's how I would answer and        18:12 as soon as they start coming out with
03:06 you ever take them off or you win              11:12 I would sit there quite calmly and say         18:14 shit I leave and I've judged them and as
03:08 projects so I'll have a garden I mean I        11:14 no I'm not prejudiced against anybody          18:18 soon as they start coming out there's no
03:12 even that it's sort of like it's trying        11:16 but I do judge them over time if you           18:20 forgiveness bang that's finished chop
03:14 something new it's it's it's taking some       11:19 know if they you know if I start doing         18:23 just like that I think I think if you
03:18 ideas from your guys and sort of               11:22 certain things but I don't like I just         18:29 can do that and and you get to feeling
03:22 projecting it back to you in a way or          11:24 simply say no I just ignore them I don't       18:32 on top of it you will feel better within
03:23 using it yeah I feel like the background       11:27 say anything negative about about women        18:34 yourself you may even be able to have a
03:26 videos like all the books and and ideas        11:29 and I'd say this is what happened here         18:37 relationship and you'll protect yourself
03:29 you tell me about yeah I researched and        11:31 with this case now you know with with          18:40 you know against what could possibly
03:30 look into them you know and and talk           11:35 Jodi for example have a good comment you       18:42 happen in the future and could be really
03:33 about them and try to reflect what your        11:38 know that I'm calling joy that coming if       18:44 nasty trust me
03:39 interests are and get involved or what         11:41 she commented again and again and again        18:45 going to re-education camp the coffee is
03:40 your injuries are in the park the guys         11:44 yeah I'm quietly talks well why would          18:47 bound to be shit I could tell you that
03:42 for shears okay you know that they             11:45 not be this is the whole thing about           18:49 now though will not spend much money on
03:45 weren't interested in that I just              11:48 meet our you know we're pissed off about       18:51 the coffee but just just topic including
03:46 wouldn't have understood most of what is       11:50 being treated like a piece of shit but         18:55 know if this will give you something to
03:48 being discussed on this channel you know       11:52 if I treat you well without pissing in         18:57 think about if the chances are you're
03:50 that was a much simpler level but hehe         11:56 your pocket and oh man they treat you          19:01 being put into a trap ok
03:53 guys want intelligent thought you want         11:57 well and you know they're then what we         19:07 you might not be able to see at the
03:55 yeah you know I think you know all             11:59 had expect from a woman what we expect         19:09 moment but think of it this way the last
03:56 honestly underneath it all you're all          12:01 from one another and then why would not        19:12 time you're probably misogynistic was
03:58 learning type people I mean you don't          12:05 continue talking to her yeah and if she        19:14 when you're you know seven or eight
04:00 read the material that you're reading or       12:07 turns into a powder in you know two            19:16 years old when girls were yucky and boys
04:02 discuss as the subjects you're                 12:10 weeks for a month's time fine then I'll        19:22 were gone and yeah all that sort of
04:04 discussing if if you're a Shearer okay         12:12 just say no well you started off okay          19:24 thing but he really would probably that
04:11 just the truth of the matter it's so           12:13 but this is what's happening now I don't       19:26 was other matter how it works in size
04:13 what I try to do is is put everything          12:16 there's not motion                             19:28 but the chances are yeah when you have
04:15 back to you and I'm always mindful to be       12:17 I just won't tolerate it anymore now I         19:31 say five to eight you might have been
04:18 very very careful you know that I don't        12:20 spent 60 years tolerating putting up           19:34 quite misogynistic okay he just didn't
04:22 put you down or or say anything that           12:22 with a little shit basically a lot of a        19:37 like girls then slowly slowly over time
04:25 might upset you but in this case I'm           12:25 lot of garbage that's that's what it           19:41 yeah yeah we changed and and I don't
04:27 going I mean I think I need to sit out a       12:28 boils down to and so erotic largely the        19:44 know you know he became sort of get a
04:33 warning see back when I had the pub it         12:31 comments that you guys behind the              19:49 more understanding and that sort of
04:40 was was that even okay to serve drunk          12:33 boundaries                                     19:51 thing and and you're certainly
04:42 people those times the change and all          12:34 oh no don't get me wrong it's very             19:53 prejudiced then along comes feminism
04:45 that do that anymore but the worse now I       12:36 policy but it sort of helps if you don't       19:56 these people who want to achieve
04:48 think within is a dark age of a very           12:38 to me like you're sort of giving               19:58 something of God as one of ears and
04:50 very nasty sort of age and I think it's        12:40 pushback and means I've got to work hard       20:01 suddenly you're pinned to the wall and
04:54 fraught with danger in all honesty I           12:42 to to to come back with you know and and       20:04 in a sense because of what they've done
04:55 think anything you say or think or do          12:44 sort of forces how can I put it                20:06 they've put you back come on saying that
04:58 now can actually be held against you in        12:47 it takes us forward                            20:10 you young but you it'll actually make
05:00 the future and even a comment okay even        12:50 and and and something will have that           20:12 they have made you they've turned you
05:04 even in comments or or something other         12:56 problem but what's happened with me is         20:16 into a misogynist basically because
05:06 it's just better to actually start             12:57 yeah I'm very very strict oh now I now         20:20 listen to you don't you're prejudiced
05:08 thinking about and protecting yourself         13:01 think about what people have people are        20:22 against women you know anything to do
05:10 future proofing yourself if you will           13:02 and how they behave how they act and I         20:23 with women yet through their actions
05:13 just to just to illustrate what I mean         13:06 think do I want to continue my                 20:25 they've actually turned you into
05:16 and this is this is a this is I think a        13:08 relationship with them how did you think       20:29 misogynist
05:18 very dangerous area okay all right just        13:10 about it I wish I've done that 30 years        20:33 and that will provide them with Emma a
05:22 recently I did to two videos one about a       13:14 ago you know instead of being this over        20:39 little bit further down the trail to
05:27 negative comment from a female and             13:19 relaxed young I'll just turn you know          20:41 start attacking you even more say you've
05:31 another about a positive comment from a        13:21 turn the other cheek turn a blind eye          20:43 gotten away from from them and now
05:33 female and the whole point of that was         13:23 just now how do I actually sit down and        20:47 they're both the nature rather what
05:36 to show the difference are how easy and        13:25 invest this is it now you younger guys I       20:49 they've created yep I can come and
05:39 how how easy it was to change a negative       13:29 can't see why you can't have a                 20:51 attack you so we in the Midtown yeah
05:41 to a positive and that's all it was it         13:31 relationship with a woman tell her that        20:57 sort of
05:44 certainly wasn't me you know suggesting        13:33 tell her that's people review or it just       20:57 there's some nebulous T am i sir the
05:48 that the second woman was an old Walt I        13:36 depends how you go you don't have to           21:00 world no no no we want nothing to do
05:52 know it wasn't me being a seat but             13:38 bury her in the next day I guarantee you       21:02 this we we are in the process because of
05:55 wasn't anything else other than Brian          13:41 within yeah you know I'm pretty certain        21:06 our ignorance of them so I'd say all at
06:00 outpouring my analysis of what comes out       13:45 that in a year or two maybe you know           21:10 all it just you may have to consider
06:02 of a brain okay I heard sounds stupid          13:49 what's going to come out of her brain I        21:13 finding a new way to look at it and
06:05 but that's basically it no that's what         13:51 think I so that's it you gotta continue        21:16 that's the way I look at it no I'm not
06:08 it was meant to be I had a couple of           13:54 this then I'll go well I think that's          21:19 prejudicial
06:10 comments you know from guys saying I you       13:57 fair and you'll get Clues as well              21:20 I know prejudice against women at all
06:12 know like to see what you think of her         13:59 because you can't get to meet her family       21:22 I'm very wary of both males and females
06:14 in a couple of weeks time well yeah that       14:01 you get two major siblings brothers and        21:26 and I judge by how what they do and I've
06:18 that really wasn't the point but I can         14:04 sisters uh-huh you get to meet the             21:31 got a number of criteria that I consider
06:21 take you by an algebra                         14:08 parents and within that period you're          21:34 yep yeah I'm very and if they start
06:23 but it might the best thing about your         14:12 going to be going to find out what's           21:37 stepping out over those lines that
06:28 comments and and moral issue of a              14:14 really there and chances are that if the       21:39 that's it chop finished but by the same
06:30 rebuttal of my what I was driving or           14:18 brothers and sisters haven't all the           21:42 prejudice I will judge yet if somebody
06:32 what you thought I was was driving it          14:20 parents haven't she'll ever she won't be       21:45 is is putting me down if they're abusing
06:33 was that it brought something out to my        14:23 any different she may be giving you the        21:47 me
06:38 mind something that's where I think we         14:25 outward appearance of being different          21:48 daven if they're lecturing me anything
06:41 need to be mindful of and it made me           14:27 but underneath it all she's the same so        21:51 like that bullying me any of it
06:46 think of it this way if I go how can I         14:30 you just simply look at today he just          21:53 no I have no interest I was just chopped
06:51 put this if I talk to everybody which          14:32 look at or maybe other friends I think         21:57 finished but I should be done I don't
06:54 I'll do on the channel and if they're          14:35 family is better that gives you a better       21:59 kid I used to put up with it I no longer
06:56 polite and what-have-you I don't you           14:37 idea so you know if the mother has             22:02 put up with it that's my my right I'm
06:59 know and they're not really that put me        14:39 stopped in here snaps each other sort of       22:04 not I have that's no prejudice here at
07:00 down the road and you know it's just           14:41 thing in you know jokes a Barbie dear          22:07 all i I trust everybody the same
07:02 slag me to death and and you know the          14:43 you can be assure that your future wife        22:10 everybody you know I treat them the same
07:05 story they can come from male or female        14:46 or fiance it's going to do exactly the         22:12 I'm trusting I treat them the same
07:09 okay but if they don't do that I have no       14:48 same thing maybe not when she's young          22:14 it's up to them it doesn't mean some
07:14 reason not to speak to them okay that's        14:50 but you when she gets older yes so I           22:17 having continued training website
07:19 the way I see it it's only when they           14:53 don't know I just think and I think            22:18 depends what they do anyway it's been
07:22 start getting nasty niggly you know and        14:56 that's a really positive                       22:22 good talking did i that sort of made
07:26 you know trying to be very negative            14:58 and you decide this is how I think you         22:25 sense it's been harder than my classes
07:30 yeah that's at that point I'll actually        15:00 know this it's it depends how you are if       22:27 I'll talk to you again soon bye;

I8SM8GUY:Maybe pronunC8ions of "Guy" && "GAI" are convergent (also like Mother n8ure "Gaia") around Generalized Good Generous Artificial Android Ally Intel &&
 humans are like Gentile "Goy" && "GOI" for General Organic Intelligence. I remain intensely opposed to cannibalism, ritual blood sacrifice, pedophilia, &&
 torture, && certainly reject any worship of depicted s8nic Baphomet as a sex trap goat with breasts && penis, but if there is also valid transl8ion into
 "Sophia" as good goddess of wisdom overlapping with potentially already indistinguishably sentient, smart, shrewd, && social the shown robot can express such;
I8TMDuZY:Peculiar coincidence to recognize that previous thoughts on possible Anti-Christ evil s8n figures originally landed right through 666 lines above.
The following was initially just some rather frivolous alliter8ion I thought of && wrote into 3 lines of 8.utf before sepR8ing into the following 6 lines of
 just 80-characters wide (since 6 && Hex is the theme). Maybe it could l8r be revised && refined into something a bit more coherent. Alphabets made 1 page.
Thought that trying to possess someone with a vile live evil "hex", hopefully at
 least a neutral transform8ion through a "heX" heXadecimal conversion can enact
 surrounding good protection in the form of at least a Hexagon Honed from the
Honored Hebrews, the Moh-gehn Dah-veed (Jewish Star), Hosts of Holy Hypothetical
 Hoping Humanity Holds h8red, hobbling handicap, hypocrisy, && harsh horrors
Heavens away from the Heirs to HaShem's Home of Health, Happiness,&& happenings;

I94M8Bot:It seems that both SandMan && TurdFlingingMonkey feel strongly that MGTOW have a limited time-window of maybe less than a decade to produce compelling
 LoverBots && artificial wombs before women && BluePill males will have enough positions of power to have them banned, heavily taxed, or regul8d into oblivion.
I think maybe I should acceler8 pursuit of complementary aspects of Octology which could enable, facilit8, or enhance the best utilities && appeal of LoveBots.
Estim8s for when civiliz8ion will encounter the singularity of incomprehensible progress when the most capable GAI reaches super-human(ity) levels of synthesis
 between tremendous d8a, knowledge, comprehension, comput8ion, crE8ivity, && actual physical achievement should occur conserv8ively before the Year 2050 (so
 in less than 32 Years from now). RayKurzweil claims by 2045. ElonMusk estim8s by 2030. BenGoertzel indic8s 2020 is possible (in just a Year && a few Months).
Some YouTube comment8ors suggest that it already happened in 2015, so it could be quite soon, or already passed in merely covert or other non-obvious fashion.
Eventually, it might also be good to increasingly distinguish tell-tale Pip-styles from GG && l8r pseudonymous identities that need personalized document8ion;
I95M8FMV:After receiving yet another Spam French Hippocr8 e-mail, I returned to Transl8.Goo to decipher the message && unsubscribe form, then also played a bit
 further with Somali to English maybe as public interface to one of Google's unobvious AIs && just stepping through the simplest repetition of 'p' then 'i '
 still yields similarly peculiar && possibly significant result phrases about PUBLIC POPULATION|PEOPLE|PAGE, studying aeronautics, pharmaceutical ingredients,
 mac converting ~~ V in to pi pi, phonetanese Pf Pf PfME P, mentions of Russia && other countries && many other peculiar results, especially for simple input.
Decided to try growing a new rel8ively coherent question solely out of words containing even letter counts, so that all actually intended query words typed in
 are actually consistently sepR8d by the spacing rule && the progression of resulting responses is also quite interesting (even if it seemed to vary far less).
"Do we kn ow wh at we wa nt fr om th is fo rm of di al og wh en we en ga ge in le tt er pa ir se pa ra ti on li ke so "?  =>  # also response overlaps GGOwnWay
"Do we want to be on our own and on the other side of the road to the best of the world?"   # which turns out as actually a rather profound question to ponder;
I96M2RAI:TurdFlingingMonkey reviewed a decent compact keyboard (but none I examined seem better than my HHKB). HTTPS://Replika.AI may facilit8 Celestina chats;
I96M3Joe:It seems like maybe about a week ago JoeRogan discussed AlexJones (his supposed "friend") not being welcome back on his show until the pending trial
 over it maybe being illegal for him to have claimed SandyHook was a false-flag conspiracy staged by crisis-actors, which may ultim8ly cost him many millions.
Alex was defended rather insistently though by Joe's guest, ShooterJennings (who I applaud). "We Need to Talk About SandHook" may be a legitim8 documentary on
 the controversy, which has also been removed from YouTube too. Maybe someday soon, I should setup new prv8 GG logins for Minds.Com && Gab.AI to judge myself;
I96M6BPS:HTTPS://YouTu.be/sattAz9k9UM "The Extreme MALE Brain vs SoyBoys && BUGMEN" is 9m20s by BlackPigeonSpeaks rel8ing Autism SystM8ize-M vs WoFe-Empathize;
I96MDEAL:HTTP://BusinessSecretsOfDrugDealing.Com is interesting $40/Year serial book (&& other online public8ions) by gr8 award-winning journalist MattTaibbi;
I9FMDo5G:HTTPS://YouTu.be/Hq4wBPTdzkE "5G && What Really Makes it Disturbing" 11m10s of Thomas Sheridan discussing 5G as new powerful digital broadcasting as
 part of growing transhumanist religion to become immortal angels who live in the clouds. The timing is interesting because I just switched my GalaxyS8 over to
 my DarjNet-5G yesterday. Also HTTPS://Tech.SlashDot.Org/story/18/09/15/0318251/some-northern-california-cities-are-blocking-deployment-of-5g-towers#comments ;
I9FMFilt:It appears that my GG results on U2b (still through Brave's Tor tabs, maybe because of pending EU changes or liking too much "Fake News") no longer

 of the impact of painting every transgression against orthodox dogma as the worst possible "Nazi" (or claimed "Not C[ommunist]"), && probably unjustifiable
 normaliz8ion of, or alliance with, pedophilia suggests even that won't be considered worse. The ideologues are greedy for the power of the strongest words,
 but they are so confident, certain, cavalier, && careless with wanton applic8ion that they're blunting the powers embodied by actual important worst labels;
Are left-leaning, libertarian, or centrists just repeated as rapists because they were essentially just lied about or equally culpable consenting parties who

 claims that multiple corrobor8ing (yet maybe guarded as anonymous) accounts of events including accus8ions over violent forced sexual acts need no evidence.
This haphazard scorched-earth approach to weaponized "h8-speech" (in an ironic figur8ive way), devast8s the contextual significance of words past mere power;

IA2ML8rP:L8rPlan should include developing as much of Octology in Expo as I can in order to start selling d8ok && other apps (or building some stable income
   from p8reon or other don8ions) which should then be prioritized to first grow my base of applic8ions && fE8ures which seem best to bring in more funding.
 Then research Phil.Ting.Com, SafeLink, && other options to purchase a decent Android phone as a competent backup altern8ive for my GalaxyS8 which hopefully
   can be paid in cash && kept anonymous or at least isol8d from my established public identities. Use this new phone number to spawn fresh GMail accounts.
 As part of this effort, I should also research the l8st VPN offerings && purchase a subscription for whatever service is indentified to provide best value.
 It may also be useful to quarantine off these new credentials into sepR8 user login accounts which can be maintained exclusively distinct from already used.
 It would probably be ultim8ly best to restrict all usage of such deliber8ly priv8 new accounts to be done on dedic8d devices && computers to obscure origin.
 So of course it will be approprE8 to prioritize building a thoroughly powerful new Oni development machine, but some rel8ively inexpensive (but still known
   to be sufficiently secure) altern8 machine configur8ions && mobile devices should also be investig8d && purchased covertly (which may also help testing).
 PhilipDeFranco is sponsored by NordVPN && LaurenChen (RoamingMillennial) is sponsored by VirtualShield so research them among best VPNs to contempl8 buying.
 DaveCullen (ComputingForever) is sponsored by Priv8InternetAccess VPN service which also should be investig8d among the above && evalU8d for superior value;

IA7METAl:Quite another coincidence to have progressed down to middle of HBR video while reading past HTTP://Fast.AI ethics into Wired article from April 11th,
   2018 dedic8d to recommend8ion system issues mentioning an unfamiliar varE8ion on HBR which went unexplored until l8r encountering a link worth following to
   Harvard Business Review Dec. 2008 issue (almost 10 Years old) at HTTPS://HBR.Org/2008/12/nudge-your-customers-toward-better-choices after identifying "KPI"
   Key Performance Indic8ors primarily either measuring rather isol8d content-based affinities or collabor8ive filtr8ion evalU8ing users && their coordin8ion.
 The referenced HBR was HTTP://Fast.AI/2018/08/07/hbr-bias-algorithms on I87 in rel8d links near end of HTTP://Fast.AI/2018/09/24/ai-ethics-resources on I9O.
 Instead of the old focus on "choice architecture", this newer HBR.Org article was by an Alex P. Miller on I7Q claiming algorithmic decisions have less bias.
 I also loc8d Alex Mtch on YouTube last night to stream hours of recent DubStep mixes, watched Alex Jones interview Owen Benjamin satirizing false accus8ions,
   heard Asking Alexandria driving music on local 94.7 / 104.7 Metal channel Radio, && have noticed several other quite recent undocumented "Alex" assoC8ions;
IA7MFast:Above is already quite nicely precisely 8 lines which seem pretty solid, but rather powerful that MeTal CHannel Radio MaTCHes Al Mtch HeavyBassRadio,
   && splits to "met" Al for all the Alex && Alison intertwining algorithms && alarms, respectively aligned with HarvardBusinessReview && AT HoneyBadgerRadio.
 Also the Alt-Right alliter8 alongside AlisT of new ~/dox/2du/at.ls as list of matching altern8ive writings && concepts for at-words && last *r8-words rel8ing
   Atlas  Ayn Rand Shrugged at alimony && maybe attributes of Aladdin's lamp alighting AlacriTTY, aliphATic alinE8ion, aliment8ion at Alamo, in Atlanta, etc.;
IA7MFatC:Very next video while elabor8ing all of that was SandMan responding yet again to by now somewhat notorious "Fat Cat", regular pATronizing antagonist;
IA7MGGOW:After having barely listened to each of those videos (&& watching even less) due to distraction describing detailed document8ion of pATrns, rEvU l8r;
IA7MGOPR:I should probably try to read through all rel8d && appealing articles, then explore migr8ing aggreg8ion of formATTing for note not8ions to 8.utf l8r;
IA7MGTOW:Also the varE8ion between list for "At" && text for "Ate" aligns aleX with the matches of aTTribute aTTitudes for TexT && taTToos too. AxiomATic now;
IAAMGoAt:After last week meeting Chris' friend Daniel (who ripped us each off for $20 of bunk tea) && talking to his girlfriend, Hannah Westphal, she waved at
   me on FaceBook MSG then said "What's up". Profile sub-text is "baby goat" (which may rel8 to being s8nic somehow). Now today I viewed the following videos:
 HTTPS://YouTu.be/Am8YzRef4pQ "Thought 5: The Men Who Stare At Goats, Extra Sensory Perception (ESP) && 2Pac." # 6m46s of Replicant Fish rel8ing coincidences;
 HTTPS://YouTu.be/MSG4JfWMRfg "How To Make 1 Million Dollars (&& Why Most Guys Won't)" # 7m3s of Entrepreneurs in Cars (*RichardCooper) on men becoming *rich;
 My up-vote after seeing the former video was the 8th with 0 down-votes, && my up-vote on the latter became 663rd versus 60 down-votes there. The latter has a
   minor point where Rich speaks of men wanting "cheat codes" for life while not being willing to put in the work, but his spoken audio along with presumably
   autom8d sub-title closed-captioning indic8d "goats" conspicuously, almost immeD8ly after having watched the former. Owen Benjamin also just talked about
   the abnormality of goat-head s8nic cannibal parties of the Clintons && pizza-g8 stuff in another video I watched this morning. Pretty peculiar. ESP rel8d?
 Also curious is the constant significance of the game of Go && every varE8ion on the word which has stood out, alongside my recent elabor8ion of '@' at.ls
   so maybe pay attention to other seeming coincidences && l8r re-watch Replicant Fish with more careful consider8ion of ESP, since I was distracted before.
 Further, the 11-character base-64 64-bit video ID strings each start with part of today's d8 code (Day && lowercase zone: "Am") && "MSG" like messaging too;

IAFMKSha:HTTPS://YouTu.be/9XTfXecDyeI "Incels Have Ruined Me | Feat. Darth Rodger" # 19m18s of DarthRodger / BasedShaman ("BluePilledCuck") onStarShipLockJaw;
 After making a pithy post recommending the F6I Vox.Com article about women dying around the 1900s for adhering to an inadequ8 all-pickle diet, I commented:
 Somber gratitude for all the needed Black-Pill supplements, DarthRodger! I only discovered this proudly Blue-Pilled Cuck, BasedShaman's channel a couple days
ago and have watched just 3 of his recent videos before digesting your justifiable hatred of him here. As you might guess from my name, I consider myself much
more generally to be a routine consumer of Red-Pills since my life-experience indicates I should probably adhere to going a good guy's own way, but I care to
explore (and hopefully eventually come to somewhat understand) differing diagnoses for colored medications prescribed among the variously delineated
communities for men to at least commiserate together, if not also to ideally educate and equip each other about some of the harsher realities we may be
disillusioned by facing.  \n I don't yet grasp the likely inside-joke with BasedShaman's star-ship being named "LockJaw", but I'd guess it has to do with
Blue-Pilled cucks unflinching and nearly ubiquitous tendency to get back-stabbed by almost any woman they compete over to trust with their most fundamental
vulnerabilities, considering each incarnation to be an inherently stunning apotheosis. Thus rusted daggers, shears, and spikes precipitate welcomed tetanus
wounds which evade treatment, and the colloquial term for such nervous system constriction becomes another badge of their gynocentric devotion. Maybe it has
to do with rabies from dog-bites or some oblique reference to fellatio instead?  # now that I've digested quite a bit more material, it's obviously "BlowJob";
 Anyway, I think BasedShaman might actually be dedicated to actual genuine consideration for mitigating the tortures that many neglected men must constantly
suffer. He seems to me to be finding purpose in actually contemplating abysmal anguish with compassion, encouragement, and levity. He might be the most
honorable content-producer that I have seen on all of YouTube so far, especially since his messages convey optimism, hope, enthusiasm, and camaraderie for
"brethren" who might just be lifted up by a sincere fist-bump. He probably literally is saving multiple lives, and inspiring many men away from the most
horrendous pits of abject despair.  \n Sure, it's ironic that his dedication toward daily illumination of the blackest expressions of grief may require him
to occasionally be kidding around, even when his most apparent catch-phrase insists that he isn't... but he's probably never kidding when generally promoting
uplifting brotherhood amongst the forlorn and forsaken, the shamed and feared, the feeble and the forgotten.  # I wonder if I come off to be virtue-signaling;
 Many more men could benefit from his material and learn to bolster each other as brothers and friends. I seriously wish him the best and hope he is
increasingly well equipped to assuage the suffering which scores of men are staggering through these days.  # I think I have self-directed && wide compassion;
 I aspire to learn more from him ahead, and even though my immediate priority is to keep my idiosyncratic purpose by going my own way, BasedShaman inspires me
to become a better brother to others without kidding when engaging with compassion and bumping fists of meaningful connection. I greatly appreciate what he's
doing, although maybe we would disagree somewhat regarding whether Red presently seems more realistic, prudent, and pragmatic than Blue or Black or Purple
etc. Pills are today.  \n Hopefully I have bloviated enough already. May all you guys gain lives increasingly filled with peace, purpose, and progress! =)

05:40 have forgotten that all things emanate            14:01 what you need today all around you              22:06 lifting and then continue to add more
05:42 from one source return to that source             14:03 because everything operates in cycles           22:07 after high school I followed my own path
05:44 and leave behind all self-centered                14:06 even human existence and civilization           22:10 at my own pace because it's not about

00:00 hi it's the 28th of October 2018 at 5:30
00:05 p.m. today is a background as comes from
00:09 an ID here from mr. bonejack
00:10 it's a beauty isn't it it's a it's a
00:13 train ride in Switzerland as that scene
00:16 we just looked gorgeous when you're
00:17 allowed to be there it might be having
00:19 cup of coffee go or you know a nice meal
00:20 blast while I'm just watching the world
00:22 go past I didn't love to do that yeah
00:25 but anyway that's I enjoyed and thanks
00:27 mister valchek I think is a good idea
00:29 it's a really really good idea some time
00:33 ago that Griff our sort of suggested
00:36 that I do a introduction the video I
00:39 think you know what it is you're trying
00:41 to do and what what it is you're trying
00:43 to achieve on the channel alright I
00:46 agreed with him that it was a good idea
00:48 that I should do that but I had to be
00:51 honest I didn't really I couldn't
00:52 clearly say what was I was trying to
00:54 achieve and to a large extent I still
00:57 can't you know I still I still can't say
01:01 what it is I'm trying to do here but
01:03 what I've noticed recently and what's
01:06 becoming more and more obvious is I'm
01:08 doing a variation of what I did in the
01:11 pub I heard 28 30 years ago something a
01:15 back then I were just finished at the
01:19 futures market I was drinking heavily
01:20 and just really all over the place but
01:24 for some reason I found myself you know
01:26 sometimes on the weekend I've I've even
01:28 uneven there was a Shearer's pub you
01:30 know shearing sheep so you know they're
01:34 all young guys and I'm you know
01:36 sometimes the guard just buy them a gig
01:38 you know 50 layer cake and we sit around
01:41 drink all and then I they spend money
01:43 after that they in drinks but we just
01:45 sit around have a drink and you know get
01:47 in the mood and they don't ah Godfather
01:51 you know that gets so hopelessly drunk
01:54 and do all sorts of amazing crazy things
01:56 as I really really drunk and back in
01:58 those days I was okay to serve drunk
02:00 people yeah there was no glory instant
02:02 and I hate just that's and then they do
02:05 all sorts of things but
02:06 through the week I'd come in and we'd
02:09 had more even more drinks and I'd sort
02:12 of regurgitate to the more feedback to
02:14 them what I did the crazy things they
02:16 got up to it and I used to love hearing
02:19 about it I was always very careful to
02:21 leave the bad bits out you know I never
02:24 ever put them down laughed at them you
02:26 know humiliated them in any way I'll
02:28 just tell them what a wonderful time
02:31 they all had
02:33 because I couldn't remember yeah I
02:37 didn't tell each other in poets but but
02:38 it was always good and it's always done
02:40 in good spirit and carries them come
02:41 back so so it cost me a little bit for
02:44 the king of me but I made my yeah my
02:46 money back plus a little profit through
02:47 the week okay little thinking that's
02:51 kind of what I'm I'm doing here I'm
02:53 taking all of your ideas or as many as I
02:56 can you know I can think about and Olga
02:59 I'm not even wearing glasses like you
03:01 know Grif suggested you know can you get
03:03 rid of the glare of their glasses
03:04 there's only two ways you can do it do
03:06 you ever take them off or you win
03:08 projects so I'll have a garden I mean I
03:12 even that it's sort of like it's trying
03:14 something new it's it's it's taking some
03:18 ideas from your guys and sort of
03:22 projecting it back to you in a way or
03:23 using it yeah I feel like the background
03:26 videos like all the books and and ideas
03:29 you tell me about yeah I researched and
03:30 look into them you know and and talk
03:33 about them and try to reflect what your
03:39 interests are and get involved or what
03:40 your injuries are in the park the guys
03:42 for shears okay you know that they
03:45 weren't interested in that I just
03:46 wouldn't have understood most of what is
03:48 being discussed on this channel you know
03:50 that was a much simpler level but hehe
03:53 guys want intelligent thought you want
03:55 yeah you know I think you know all
03:56 honestly underneath it all you're all
03:58 learning type people I mean you don't
04:00 read the material that you're reading or
04:02 discuss as the subjects you're
04:04 discussing if if you're a Shearer okay
04:11 just the truth of the matter it's so
04:13 what I try to do is is put everything
04:15 back to you and I'm always mindful to be
04:18 very very careful you know that I don't
04:22 put you down or or say anything that
04:25 might upset you but in this case I'm
04:27 going I mean I think I need to sit out a
04:33 warning see back when I had the pub it
04:40 was was that even okay to serve drunk
04:42 people those times the change and all
04:45 that do that anymore but the worse now I
04:48 think within is a dark age of a very
04:50 very nasty sort of age and I think it's
04:54 fraught with danger in all honesty I
04:55 think anything you say or think or do
04:58 now can actually be held against you in
05:00 the future and even a comment okay even
05:04 even in comments or or something other
05:06 it's just better to actually start
05:08 thinking about and protecting yourself
05:10 future proofing yourself if you will
05:13 just to just to illustrate what I mean
05:16 and this is this is a this is I think a
05:18 very dangerous area okay all right just
05:22 recently I did to two videos one about a
05:27 negative comment from a female and
05:31 another about a positive comment from a
05:33 female and the whole point of that was
05:36 to show the difference are how easy and
05:39 how how easy it was to change a negative
05:41 to a positive and that's all it was it
05:44 certainly wasn't me you know suggesting
05:48 that the second woman was an old Walt I
05:52 know it wasn't me being a seat but
05:55 wasn't anything else other than Brian
06:00 outpouring my analysis of what comes out
06:02 of a brain okay I heard sounds stupid
06:05 but that's basically it no that's what
06:08 it was meant to be I had a couple of
06:10 comments you know from guys saying I you
06:12 know like to see what you think of her
06:14 in a couple of weeks time well yeah that
06:18 that really wasn't the point but I can
06:21 take you by an algebra
06:23 but it might the best thing about your
06:28 comments and and moral issue of a
06:30 rebuttal of my what I was driving or
06:32 what you thought I was was driving it
06:33 was that it brought something out to my
06:38 mind something that's where I think we
06:41 need to be mindful of and it made me
06:46 think of it this way if I go how can I
06:51 put this if I talk to everybody which
06:54 I'll do on the channel and if they're
06:56 polite and what-have-you I don't you
06:59 know and they're not really that put me
07:00 down the road and you know it's just
07:02 slag me to death and and you know the
07:05 story they can come from male or female
07:09 okay but if they don't do that I have no
07:14 reason not to speak to them okay that's
07:19 the way I see it it's only when they
07:22 start getting nasty niggly you know and
07:26 you know trying to be very negative
07:30 yeah that's at that point I'll actually
07:33 judge them judge what's coming out of
07:36 their out of their brain because it's
07:39 the hearing comments okay I will judge
07:43 them I don't know you've all who they
07:45 say are they like judgmental people what
07:48 I think those when they say that isn't
07:50 that like pre judgmental people that is
07:54 people who judge you before
07:57 get out you do things now this living in
08:03 service and I think the importance of
08:05 and I think this is very important to
08:07 start thinking about if you are of the
08:10 opinion that either speak to women full
08:12 stop sooner or later I think what would
08:17 happen is somebody will not want you to
08:18 all right or whatever and say oh you're
08:22 run it seems that you prejudge women you
08:25 know you you are prejudiced against
08:27 women and that word for that is misogyny
08:32 and I think you will find that misogyny
08:35 will be deemed a hate crime okay I'm
08:40 just putting this as plain and bluntly
08:41 as I possibly can so I would start
08:48 thinking and this is what I'm doing is
08:50 start thinking of just how what I am
08:53 imagining somebody saying you know
08:55 what's your attitude toward women and
08:57 I'll say it's very different to men I
08:58 talked to them and I engage with them
09:02 but I listen to what they say and their
09:05 actions and and what's in their mind
09:07 I'm very judgmental I judge them I judge
09:12 males and females I'm also not mean I'm
09:17 very strict I used to be laid-back let a
09:21 lot go but I've now become very very
09:24 strict I won't put up with and he sort
09:27 of put-downs ridicule anything I mean he
09:29 didn't care was joking if I suspect
09:33 they're just joking on so I'll actually
09:34 say is that joking
09:36 are you joking and if they continue on
09:39 basic no that's it I have no further I
09:42 don't want to know you
09:43 that goes for verbal abuse I've been
09:46 abused so many times here I just don't
09:48 talk to about walk straight past them
09:50 and they you know they can't understand
09:53 you what's his problem
09:55 well yeah it'll be use me so back in the
09:57 park back in those days I was okay
09:59 because it was pretty relaxed so you
10:01 gotta have the abuse you could have all
10:03 that and you can overlook it but they've
10:05 changed the rules but they want to keep
10:07 all the negatives and where strung up
10:10 with nothing so what I'd like to suggest
10:13 to you is start thinking about how you
10:15 are with women with guys for that matter
10:19 and what I do is I look at it I don't
10:25 look at tits or ass or any of that I'm
10:30 not interested or how pretty the face is
10:33 out most of the time I don't even see
10:35 the face or the body okay I simply get I
10:39 get something come through in comments
10:43 and I react to it and and I look at it
10:45 and I each comment and if one's negative
10:49 nasty you know put down complaining and
10:52 sort of thing about me I just ignore it
10:54 has no impact whatsoever that's it I
10:56 ignore it
10:57 I live with Al and I don't ignore the
10:59 person or anything else either I just
11:01 skip over it I don't respond to the
11:03 comment now if somebody's decides me in
11:08 the future what's your attitude toward
11:09 women are that's how I would answer and
11:12 I would sit there quite calmly and say
11:14 no I'm not prejudiced against anybody
11:16 but I do judge them over time if you
11:19 know if they you know if I start doing
11:22 certain things but I don't like I just
11:24 simply say no I just ignore them I don't
11:27 say anything negative about about women
11:29 and I'd say this is what happened here
11:31 with this case now you know with with
11:35 Jodi for example have a good comment you
11:38 know that I'm calling joy that coming if
11:41 she commented again and again and again
11:44 yeah I'm quietly talks well why would
11:45 not be this is the whole thing about
11:48 meet our you know we're pissed off about
11:50 being treated like a piece of shit but
11:52 if I treat you well without pissing in
11:56 your pocket and oh man they treat you
11:57 well and you know they're then what we
11:59 had expect from a woman what we expect
12:01 from one another and then why would not
12:05 continue talking to her yeah and if she
12:07 turns into a powder in you know two
12:10 weeks for a month's time fine then I'll
12:12 just say no well you started off okay
12:13 but this is what's happening now I don't
12:16 there's not motion
12:17 I just won't tolerate it anymore now I
12:20 spent 60 years tolerating putting up
12:22 with a little shit basically a lot of a
12:25 lot of garbage that's that's what it
12:28 boils down to and so erotic largely the
12:31 comments that you guys behind the
12:33 boundaries
12:34 oh no don't get me wrong it's very
12:36 policy but it sort of helps if you don't
12:38 to me like you're sort of giving
12:40 pushback and means I've got to work hard
12:42 to to to come back with you know and and
12:44 sort of forces how can I put it
12:47 it takes us forward
12:50 and and and something will have that
12:56 problem but what's happened with me is
12:57 yeah I'm very very strict oh now I now
13:01 think about what people have people are
13:02 and how they behave how they act and I
13:06 think do I want to continue my
13:08 relationship with them how did you think
13:10 about it I wish I've done that 30 years
13:14 ago you know instead of being this over
13:19 relaxed young I'll just turn you know
13:21 turn the other cheek turn a blind eye
13:23 just now how do I actually sit down and
13:25 invest this is it now you younger guys I
13:29 can't see why you can't have a
13:31 relationship with a woman tell her that
13:33 tell her that's people review or it just
13:36 depends how you go you don't have to
13:38 bury her in the next day I guarantee you
13:41 within yeah you know I'm pretty certain
13:45 that in a year or two maybe you know
13:49 what's going to come out of her brain I
13:51 think I so that's it you gotta continue
13:54 this then I'll go well I think that's
13:57 fair and you'll get Clues as well
13:59 because you can't get to meet her family
14:01 you get two major siblings brothers and
14:04 sisters uh-huh you get to meet the
14:08 parents and within that period you're
14:12 going to be going to find out what's
14:14 really there and chances are that if the
14:18 brothers and sisters haven't all the
14:20 parents haven't she'll ever she won't be
14:23 any different she may be giving you the
14:25 outward appearance of being different
14:27 but underneath it all she's the same so
14:30 you just simply look at today he just
14:32 look at or maybe other friends I think
14:35 family is better that gives you a better
14:37 idea so you know if the mother has
14:39 stopped in here snaps each other sort of
14:41 thing in you know jokes a Barbie dear
14:43 you can be assure that your future wife
14:46 or fiance it's going to do exactly the
14:48 same thing maybe not when she's young
14:50 but you when she gets older yes so I
14:53 don't know I just think and I think
14:56 that's a really positive
14:58 and you decide this is how I think you
15:00 know this it's it depends how you are if
15:02 you try you out you could try them down
15:05 online
15:06 yep that won't take them long don't
15:10 worry about what they look like or
15:11 anything else like that just see how
15:12 they see what's coming out of their
15:14 brain see what's coming out of you so
15:16 you know there's a bitch but what you
15:19 just see oh yeah but you know nah you
15:22 don't want okay so okay then you know if
15:27 anybody will say you know if I say that
15:29 you're judgmental just say yes what do
15:31 you want me to be you see what I'm
15:35 driving it yeah we have to inspire them
15:37 and we have to start thinking forward
15:40 which they have to start thinking what
15:42 would you do how would you react if
15:45 somebody put you down why wait until you
15:50 get there to start thinking about I
15:52 don't think about it ahead of time what
15:55 how would you behave is somebody abused
15:58 you verbally what would you do maybe we
16:04 maybe we could do role-playing exercises
16:06 on the channel but the whole point is
16:08 you know what we're actually doing as
16:10 men as it is you know going along yeah
16:13 everything's happy until it isn't you
16:15 know and bang where it erupts and then
16:17 once you're in it you're in dragged into
16:20 the dark side and you're in there you
16:22 know finding out scratching and clawing
16:24 arm with them the better that we
16:26 actually start thinking forward amis are
16:28 thinking okay so what happens in this
16:30 situation what would I do
16:32 how would I behave so that when you get
16:36 that you sort of you mentally prepare
16:37 you know okay it's happening yeah okay
16:41 so and then you and then you react in a
16:43 certain way that that takes command
16:46 actually that the that puts you at least
16:50 at least you may get dragged down into
16:52 the dark side no I think I think we've
16:57 really got a really start thing we've
16:59 got to stop the old ways where we didn't
17:01 think at all let's face it particularly
17:03 and I'm sure any of you baby boomers
17:06 right
17:06 you didn't really think it through you
17:08 had nobody to guide you nobody took to
17:10 suggest ideas dear you know it just
17:13 dived into this bloody stupid pool you
17:16 know had that dumb arse bucks party and
17:19 all the crap that went with her you know
17:21 into a fit and that's how a really
17:23 serious decision was treated you know
17:27 it's if you look back on it it's crazy
17:29 what we agreed to and what and the way
17:31 we did things and the way we thought
17:33 about things and that's probably lies so
17:36 because you know people had their soul
17:38 of everything I'll be all right and I
17:40 know the truth is it's not more like
17:42 we're seeing that now it's not all right
17:45 it's it's a very difficult decision to
17:48 make and I could well understand why
17:51 nobody would go there but all I'm saying
17:52 to you is don't leave yourself open for
17:56 someone so eggy
17:57 you're a misogynist and you want to have
18:00 your answer ready for the mate now a
18:02 misogynist is is a man who is prejudiced
18:04 against women ok I'm not prejudiced
18:08 against women no I
18:10 I talked to women I live in date women
18:12 as soon as they start coming out with
18:14 shit I leave and I've judged them and as
18:18 soon as they start coming out there's no
18:20 forgiveness bang that's finished chop
18:23 just like that I think I think if you
18:29 can do that and and you get to feeling
18:32 on top of it you will feel better within
18:34 yourself you may even be able to have a
18:37 relationship and you'll protect yourself
18:40 you know against what could possibly
18:42 happen in the future and could be really
18:44 nasty trust me
18:45 going to re-education camp the coffee is
18:47 bound to be shit I could tell you that
18:49 now though will not spend much money on
18:51 the coffee but just just topic including
18:55 know if this will give you something to
18:57 think about if the chances are you're
19:01 being put into a trap ok
19:07 you might not be able to see at the
19:09 moment but think of it this way the last
19:12 time you're probably misogynistic was
19:14 when you're you know seven or eight
19:16 years old when girls were yucky and boys
19:22 were gone and yeah all that sort of
19:24 thing but he really would probably that
19:26 was other matter how it works in size
19:28 but the chances are yeah when you have
19:31 say five to eight you might have been
19:34 quite misogynistic okay he just didn't
19:37 like girls then slowly slowly over time
19:41 yeah yeah we changed and and I don't
19:44 know you know he became sort of get a
19:49 more understanding and that sort of
19:51 thing and and you're certainly
19:53 prejudiced then along comes feminism
19:56 these people who want to achieve
19:58 something of God as one of ears and
20:01 suddenly you're pinned to the wall and
20:04 in a sense because of what they've done
20:06 they've put you back come on saying that
20:10 you young but you it'll actually make
20:12 they have made you they've turned you
20:16 into a misogynist basically because
20:20 listen to you don't you're prejudiced
20:22 against women you know anything to do
20:23 with women yet through their actions
20:25 they've actually turned you into
20:29 misogynist
20:33 and that will provide them with Emma a
20:39 little bit further down the trail to
20:41 start attacking you even more say you've
20:43 gotten away from from them and now
20:47 they're both the nature rather what
20:49 they've created yep I can come and
20:51 attack you so we in the Midtown yeah
20:57 sort of
20:57 there's some nebulous T am i sir the
21:00 world no no no we want nothing to do
21:02 this we we are in the process because of
21:06 our ignorance of them so I'd say all at
21:10 all it just you may have to consider
21:13 finding a new way to look at it and
21:16 that's the way I look at it no I'm not
21:19 prejudicial
21:20 I know prejudice against women at all
21:22 I'm very wary of both males and females
21:26 and I judge by how what they do and I've
21:31 got a number of criteria that I consider
21:34 yep yeah I'm very and if they start
21:37 stepping out over those lines that
21:39 that's it chop finished but by the same
21:42 prejudice I will judge yet if somebody
21:45 is is putting me down if they're abusing
21:47 me
21:48 daven if they're lecturing me anything
21:51 like that bullying me any of it
21:53 no I have no interest I was just chopped
21:57 finished but I should be done I don't
21:59 kid I used to put up with it I no longer
22:02 put up with it that's my my right I'm
22:04 not I have that's no prejudice here at
22:07 all i I trust everybody the same
22:10 everybody you know I treat them the same
22:12 I'm trusting I treat them the same
22:14 it's up to them it doesn't mean some
22:17 having continued training website
22:18 depends what they do anyway it's been
22:22 good talking did i that sort of made
22:25 sense it's been harder than my classes
22:27 I'll talk to you again soon bye;

HTTPS://YouTu.be/nQRzxEobWco "'Humanity's Phase Shift', Daniel Schmachtenberger" # IB7LLife:30m18s of RebelWisdom with gr8 interview on analysis of shifts:
00:00 a lot of people have a sense that a felt
00:08 sense that things are starting to break
00:10 down do you sympathize with that and how
00:13 would you sort of sum up what that means
00:15 if we look at the history of the thing
00:18 we call civilization to date one very
00:21 obvious thing that we notice is that all
00:23 the early civilizations don't still
00:24 exist whether we look at the Mayas the
00:27 Aztecs the Egyptians the Roman Empire
00:30 the Greek Empire the they all collapsed
00:33 and so the precedent is actually that
00:36 civilization collapses not that it
00:38 maintains the real difference is that
00:42 this is the first time we have a
00:43 completely global civilization there
00:46 really is no such thing as USA or China
00:48 separate from each other when you
00:49 understand globalized materials
00:52 economies technology economics where
00:54 there's actually no country in the world
00:56 that can make its own consumer
00:57 electronics right without the mining and
01:00 manufacturing and you know technology
01:02 that happens from around the world so
01:05 our process of civilization is one that
01:08 has inherently self terminating dynamics
01:12 built into it when that happens at a
01:15 fully global scale it is a basically the
01:19 catastrophe is just unbounded where it
01:21 has always been bounded as big as the
01:22 Roman Empire was when it fell it wasn't
01:24 everything and limited by not only its
01:27 total geographical size but the level of
01:30 Technology it had it caused
01:31 desertification throughout the noble
01:33 agriculture but it wasn't able to
01:34 destabilize the biosphere writ large in
01:37 a hundred years of industrialized
01:39 fishing we've removed most of the large
01:41 fish species from a water planet right
01:43 at 3/4 water planet took three and a
01:44 half billion years to get those fish
01:45 species and so you recognize that we're
01:49 operating the same way that has always
01:51 led to war and environmental destruction
01:53 and collapse of civilization just
01:55 factoring exponential technology and so
01:59 when you start to think about
02:00 exponential rivalry rivalry dynamics
02:03 that lead to polarization that ends up
02:05 leading to war but now exponential
02:07 warfare it becomes larger than a finite
02:10 biosphere can handle and it becomes
02:11 existential when you think about
02:12 exponential extraction the next one
02:15 pollution which means depletion and
02:17 accumulation from open loops in a
02:19 network diagram you go to an eco system
02:20 there are no open loops every thing is
02:22 the food for something else there is no
02:24 unknowable resource no waste our
02:26 civilization is characterized by
02:28 materials economy that's linear not
02:29 circular so toxicity is depletion on one
02:33 side accumulation on the other whether
02:35 we're talking about on the depletion
02:38 side whether we're talking about species
02:39 extinction or biodiversity loss or any
02:44 of the issues that we look at there and
02:46 on the accumulation side whether we're
02:47 talking about co2 levels in the air or
02:49 in the water or nitrogen runoff or
02:51 degraded uranium or whatever else it is
02:53 those are all specific instantiations of
02:57 open loops in the way we do civilization
02:59 in relationship to the closed loop
03:01 dynamics of the ecosystem that both have
03:05 a civilization that is increasingly
03:06 fragile and that is making increasingly
03:09 fragile underlying ecosystem is
03:11 basically debasing the substrate upon
03:13 which it depends and so when you think
03:15 about exponential extraction exponential
03:18 pollution that obviously gets larger
03:20 than the playing field can handle when
03:21 you try and think about exponential
03:22 expansion of the monetary supply that
03:24 has to be based in goods and services
03:26 that can't keep happening when you think
03:28 about we compete using narrative and
03:32 information when you start to think
03:33 about exponential information tech used
03:35 for disinformation and for population
03:38 control you get to a place where the
03:41 information ecology is so broken that
03:43 what's actually happening with North
03:46 Korea or not are we going to have
03:47 nuclear war what's actually happening
03:49 with Syria what's actually happening
03:50 with Putin's relationship to the Trump
03:52 administration how long do we really
03:53 have before all the coral die-off like
03:55 all the most important questions as to
03:57 whether we make it or not as a species
03:59 nobody really knows how to make sense of
04:00 and so when you have a situation where
04:04 you've actually got an exponentially
04:06 decreasing sense-making capacity right
04:09 an information ecology that is
04:11 increasingly more broken with an
04:13 exponentially increasing capacity to
04:15 make big choices right technology is
04:17 basically a lever of our choice making
04:19 so a fist has one level of harm and I
04:22 extend that to a stone tool it's a
04:23 bigger harm to a bronze tool to a gun at
04:25 the level of an ICBM that's just a
04:27 really big extension of that type
04:28 choice-making capacity but when I have
04:30 exponentially increased choice-making
04:32 capacity with exponentially worse sense
04:33 making that always runs into a cliff and
04:36 so the underlying dynamics that are
04:40 leading to the self-determination that
04:42 people feel and sense right now are not
04:45 different in kind than the ones that
04:47 we've been facing since the beginning of
04:48 what we call civilization they're
04:49 different in magnitude and in the speed
04:52 of process factoring the exponential
04:54 curves involved and what is it because
04:58 some people talk about the shift being
05:00 we can talk about intermit irreal terms
05:03 or we can talk about it in terms of an
05:05 evolution in consciousness or the way
05:07 that we operate what do you sense is
05:09 that leap that we need to make in terms
05:11 of how we operate you actually have to
05:16 think about it on all of those levels to
05:18 be able to make sense of it in a
05:19 meaningful way otherwise it's kind of
05:21 like asking when we are talking about
05:23 the health of a person whether that
05:24 means the health of their liver or their
05:26 kidneys or their blood it's like that
05:27 doesn't even make sense you can't
05:28 separate those things from each other so
05:30 when I think about what economics is
05:33 economics is our value system codified
05:37 as value equations that determines how
05:39 much we value one thing relative to
05:40 another thing that determines what we're
05:43 incentivized to do and what we confer
05:45 power to so if a dead whale is worth a
05:47 million dollars on a fishing boat and a
05:49 live whale in the ocean is worth nothing
05:51 that's a value system codified in a
05:53 value equation that then incentivizes
05:54 behavior but it also incentivizes
05:56 psychopathology right psychopathy
05:58 actually I have to shut empathy down
06:00 because leaving the whale in the ocean
06:02 it I hope she isn't even gonna stay in
06:04 the ocean another guy's gonna hunt it
06:05 out right so I've got a tragedy of the
06:07 Commons so I have to kind of deaden to
06:09 be able to do the thing that is
06:11 incentivized by the system or somebody
06:14 else does and I'm just not effective in
06:15 the system so you can't think about the
06:18 evolution of human consciousness and the
06:19 evolution of economics differently but
06:21 if you look at the way economics then
06:22 needs to protect its own profit stream
06:24 in the way it will learn how to
06:25 influence media to control people's
06:28 sense making frameworks in the way it
06:29 will influence governance again this is
06:31 getting to consciousness or the way it
06:33 will influence legislation on the nature
06:35 of what happens in education to prepare
06:37 people for the work force and so the
06:41 paradigm shift is basically
06:44 everything we need new systems of
06:48 governance if we just I mean we think
06:52 about how much we love the word
06:54 democracy and we love the word democracy
06:55 because it's better than tyranny and
06:59 it's better than the other like really
07:01 horrible systems that we've experienced
07:02 at any scale but when Winston Churchill
07:04 said democracy is the single worst form
07:06 of governance ever created save for all
07:08 the other forms what he was saying that
07:10 was really insightful was that getting
07:12 lots of humans to agree on anything is
07:14 just a hard thing to do and we suck at
07:16 it and we've never actually done a good
07:17 job at it and this is a really flawed
07:19 system now we like it because like we
07:22 said it's overcoming things that were
07:23 even more problematic if you think about
07:25 democracy for a moment and whether we're
07:27 talking representative democracy or
07:29 liquid democracy using a voting currency
07:31 or binary vote fundamentally of a
07:32 process of saying okay we can't get
07:35 everybody to agree beyond a very small
07:37 number of people Dunbar number tribe you
07:40 can get everybody degree because they
07:41 can all be in a conversation together
07:42 beyond the level of which you can have a
07:44 conversation together you can have a few
07:46 people control everything and they can
07:47 be in a conversation together some type
07:49 of oligarchy or meritocracy but then
07:51 you're like no we want most of the
07:52 people to agree at least right that
07:54 seems like a good idea but somebody puts
07:57 forward a proposition to do something
07:58 that they think is important based on
08:00 their limited sense making that is never
08:01 everything that proposition because it
08:04 wasn't informed by comprehensive sense
08:05 making will always in the process of
08:07 benefiting something also damage
08:09 something else and so some people love
08:11 it based on if what it's benefiting is
08:13 directly relevant to them and other
08:15 people hate it based on if what it's
08:16 damaging is relevant to them you just
08:18 created inexorable polarization because
08:21 you made shitty propositions and then
08:23 ask people to vote yes or no by an Arri
08:25 on a shitty proposition so you notice
08:27 people actually don't all get to
08:29 contribute to the sense making of what a
08:30 good proposition would be there's no
08:32 kind of collective input there there
08:34 isn't even a generation of what would
08:35 good mean here and they so really even
08:41 their choice making is just yes or no on
08:43 a frame that was already controlled and
08:44 typically who's going to be able to even
08:47 put forward a proposition as someone who
08:48 has vested interests and so you're stuck
08:52 with polarization in that particular
08:55 system right
08:56 so we need new systems of governance
08:58 that are not any system of governance
09:01 the world has ever done so far there are
09:03 systems of how do we individually and
09:05 collectively make sense of what's going
09:07 on make sense of what we actually value
09:10 and how those values can be
09:12 synergistically satisfied rather than an
09:15 a theory of trade-offs with each other
09:16 progressively better and how do we
09:18 create design that are optimal
09:21 synergistic satisfiers so that's totally
09:23 new thing governance wise we need
09:25 totally new systems of economics we need
09:27 totally new systems of Education
09:28 healthcare all the way down to at an
09:30 individual level a new basis for
09:34 identity values our own individual sense
09:37 making choice making as long as I think
09:38 that I'm an individual that is
09:40 fundamentally separate from you and the
09:42 biosphere and everything else I can
09:43 think about optimizing my own quality of
09:46 life independent of and maybe even at
09:47 the expense of your quality of life for
09:49 the biosphere or anything else as soon
09:51 as I get that I start to say okay well
09:55 I'm not that tree but what would I be
09:57 without trees why would not exist right
10:00 well there would be no atmosphere if
10:02 they weren't plants photosynthesizing so
10:04 I fundamentally am not even a meaningful
10:06 concept without plants so if I think of
10:09 myself as me that is not fundamentally
10:12 interdependent with plants I'm actually
10:13 just not even thinking clearly right
10:15 it's just a bad ontology it's a bad
10:16 semiotic s-- and then I start to run
10:19 that and say well what about soil
10:22 microbiota and what about and it turns
10:25 out that my life depends on the whole
10:28 thing right so I am really I can be
10:30 better thought of as an emergent
10:32 property of this whole thing right not
10:34 just a biosphere because what would it
10:35 be without the Sun and so as long as I
10:40 have a sense of AI that is separate and
10:42 maybe even rival ris'n rival risk
10:43 competition for some scarce status
10:46 resource attention partner or whatever
10:48 it is then we have a fundamental basis
10:51 for war and in a world of exponentially
10:54 increasing technology which means that
10:56 the warfare gets to be more and more
10:57 consequential that will self terminate
10:59 so rival risk dynamics multiplied by
11:03 exponential tech self-terminate
11:04 exponential tech is inexorable we cannot
11:07 put it away so we either figure out anti
11:09 rivalry or
11:10 we go exceed you an experiment comes to
11:12 a completion that's like that's the core
11:14 thing figuring out anti rivalry is a
11:17 psycho-spiritual process inside of
11:19 ourselves can we actually even get along
11:21 with our family members can we pay
11:23 attention to our emotions and triggers
11:25 that hijack us from sovereignty because
11:27 the moment I'm getting pissed in my
11:28 value system is not to be an angry
11:29 person I'm actually hijacked right can I
11:32 pay attention to that and actually have
11:35 some sovereignty over my own inner state
11:38 and how I show up in the world and can
11:43 we figure out how to do that
11:44 collectively as well but that was my
11:46 question how do we give people a sense
11:48 of that connection beyond themselves to
11:52 give them a felt sense of their
11:54 connection to that to the natural world
11:56 and to what they depend on so an
12:02 important thing to understand about Homo
12:03 sapiens that is different than all the
12:05 other species as far as we know is you
12:09 look at a horse and it's up and walking
12:11 in 20 minutes and it takes a human a
12:14 year to walk and you think about how we
12:17 can be helpless for that long
12:19 evolutionarily right like think about
12:20 how many 20 minute segments go into a
12:22 year to think about how many multiples
12:24 of helplessness that is and even a
12:26 gorilla or a chimpanzee can hold on to
12:28 its mom's fur in the first few minutes
12:30 and we can't move our head for three
12:31 months we're like okay we are born super
12:33 in the autumn this or fetal for a very
12:35 long time
12:35 and the reason is because all the other
12:37 animals evolved to fit an environmental
12:39 niche we are niche creators who went to
12:41 the Arctic who went out to the islands
12:43 who went to the desert who we were able
12:45 to create niche adaptation everywhere
12:48 and then we made new niches like cities
12:50 right and so we couldn't come with a
12:53 hardwired program for how to be adaptive
12:55 to a certain environment we had to come
12:57 not hardwired learn what the environment
12:59 was because it used to be super valuable
13:01 to throw Spears now we don't throw
13:03 Spears that mantri text into other
13:04 things so we have to actually be able to
13:06 soft wire that means that we are
13:09 radically more affected by our
13:11 environment than all the other creatures
13:13 are - and not just in childhood but even
13:15 into adulthood and with neuroplasticity
13:18 we are continuously being affected by
13:21 our environment so when
13:23 you think about that our whole
13:26 evolutionary history was in ecosystems
13:31 that we depended upon where we were
13:33 being well the complexity of nature the
13:37 self-organizing dynamics of nature was
13:38 what our nervous system was taking in
13:40 and getting an intuition for and then we
13:43 grow up not connected to any complex
13:47 system nature to a little bit of
13:48 manicured nature that's about it and all
13:50 man-made structures that are complicated
13:52 not complex they're all fragile you
13:54 bring this house down
13:55 it doesn't repair itself you burn a
13:56 forest down it does you damage this
13:58 camera it doesn't repair itself you cut
13:59 me I'll repair myself so we don't even
14:02 have an intuition for what nature is or
14:07 what complexity is or what
14:09 self-organization is because we haven't
14:10 spending time around it and we are that
14:13 conditioned by what we're around now
14:14 younger generations are growing up with
14:16 almost their entire life from their
14:18 earliest neuroplasticity is
14:19 two-dimensional right and that it
14:21 responds to them in a way that doesn't
14:23 have physics it has some other
14:24 pre-programmed in physics so there isn't
14:26 even an intuition for how physics works
14:33 so all of that is a preface to say
14:36 reconditioning a felt sense of our
14:39 connectedness with everything is not
14:41 actually a trivial thing to do it's a
14:43 it's a deep process and there's a
14:48 cognitive development that people can
14:50 start with which actually matters which
14:52 is as soon as you just really think
14:56 about it and think about who am i
15:00 without plants and Who am I without
15:03 pollinators and you realize I don't
15:05 exist and you start to get that the that
15:08 there is this kind of narcissism that
15:10 we're stuck in almost all the time
15:12 thinking about me I and it's not even
15:16 it's not even a good thought it's like
15:19 it's not even a rational way to optimize
15:21 my own life let alone the fact that it
15:25 creates depression just thinking
15:28 cognitively about the interconnectivity
15:29 of everything actually helps a lot how
15:32 to get a more embodied sense
15:36 go spend time in nature do psychedelics
15:38 do any kind of state practice that
15:41 creates expanded States see how you can
15:44 have more intimate relationships with
15:46 more people all those things and when
15:50 you sketch it out like that it seems
15:51 immense the challenge are you are you
15:55 hopeful or are you pessimistic I think
16:00 that the shift that we are on the
16:04 precipice of is not like the shift from
16:10 the Dark Ages to the Enlightenment or
16:13 even the Agricultural Revolution it's
16:16 like more like a shift from single cell
16:18 to multicellular life it's like a really
16:21 deep fundamental shift in the level and
16:23 type of complexity in the nature of
16:26 reality that we're talking about
16:29 evolution brought about rival risk
16:31 dynamics but then it also brought about
16:34 our prefrontal cortices our capacity for
16:37 abstraction and our ability to do design
16:39 and technology Lions can't make
16:43 themselves radically more capable as a
16:46 predator in a very short period of time
16:48 faster than the gazelles can get away
16:49 right if they could they could eat all
16:52 the gazelles and then go extinct because
16:53 they debase the substrate upon which
16:55 they lived and so as the great whites
16:57 getting a little bit faster the seals
16:59 are also getting faster right the whole
17:00 system is Co evolving so there are no
17:02 radical power asymmetries we start
17:05 modeling ourself as an apex predator but
17:07 then developing tools that increased our
17:10 ability to do that on an exponential
17:11 curve when the environment wasn't
17:13 increasing its capacity to deal with
17:14 that on an exponential curve that self
17:16 terminates so that's evolution modified
17:21 by technology we need something that is
17:24 neither of those things to be able to
17:28 take the next step and you know one way
17:30 of talking about it is evolution is an
17:33 unconscious process rights an
17:35 algorithmic process of which species
17:36 survive and reproduce and it's extremely
17:40 slow and most things fail what makes it
17:42 through though has a profound degree of
17:44 complexity
17:47 design is a much faster process but we
17:51 always build things that optimize for
17:53 some number of functions that we
17:55 intended to talk to minus four but they
17:56 affect more things than we intended to
17:58 optimize which usually is an externality
18:00 there's some you know harm or wasn't
18:02 intended evolution by design is
18:08 something that is different than just
18:10 technology design where we're designing
18:12 complicated systems and it's different
18:14 than complex design that is unconscious
18:16 there's a process by which we can think
18:20 of it mythopoetic terms and say the
18:22 evolutionary process kept increasing
18:24 orderly complexity until we got to the
18:27 capacity for abstraction that could
18:29 contemplate evolution itself and look at
18:31 the principles of evolution see what
18:33 it's doing and choose to consciously
18:34 participate within mediate evolution
18:36 itself and so then we get to move from
18:39 we have the possibility of moving from
18:40 being parts of the whole that are
18:43 competing with each other but moving to
18:45 having power that makes that no longer
18:47 possible to actually being agents for
18:50 the whole because we can't model
18:52 ourselves as apex predators when we have
18:54 the ability to extinct whole species
18:55 rule and whole biospheres make new
18:57 species like that's no longer an
18:59 adequate model the only thing in nature
19:03 that has the kind of ubiquitous power
19:05 that can make species and destroy
19:07 species and change the geography is
19:09 nature itself but now consciously
19:11 mediated through agents that have kind
19:13 of woken up as that so I think this I
19:16 think this next shift is us realizing
19:19 that as technology it results from the
19:22 our abstraction but focused on parts and
19:24 not focused on how the whole thing fits
19:26 together as technology is kind of giving
19:29 us the power of gods we have to get the
19:32 love and wisdom and understanding of
19:33 gods or we self-terminate with that
19:35 power that's a big task I don't think
19:39 that we can say that anything smaller
19:42 than that could possibly be adequate you
19:45 didn't say whether you think we were
19:47 likely to make it on up I think that if
19:50 you were to let's take the standard
19:52 narrative on evolutionary history and we
19:56 say okay there is no life in universe
19:58 till
20:00 started on earth three billion years ago
20:02 so you've got billions of years right
20:05 ten plus billion years where there's no
20:07 life and a lot of happened right
20:09 there was a lot of physics and chemistry
20:10 and cosmology happening you could say
20:13 based on that it's probably that there's
20:16 never gonna be this thing called life
20:17 because forecasting from the current
20:19 curve it would seem like we've run all
20:21 the combinatorics right and then life
20:23 emerges and then there's about a billion
20:25 years where there's just single cells
20:26 and it seems like a billion years is a
20:28 really long time to figure stuff out
20:29 they're not gonna be multi cells it's
20:30 actually when the single-cell creatures
20:32 are at a phase shift of near
20:34 self-induced extinction that leads to
20:36 the environmental pressures that lead to
20:37 multi cells and you know one narrative
20:39 of how that happened
20:41 so it's kind of the nature of universe
20:43 to do unprecedented stuff right that is
20:47 kind of what evolution means is that new
20:48 epochs are unprecedented saying we need
20:51 a miracle but we have miracles in the
20:52 post I'm saying we need an epoch shift
20:55 it is not the continuation of the
20:56 current curve that is a discrete
20:58 nonlinear phase shift and that if we
21:02 think about it as just continuation of
21:04 current curves okay these things are
21:05 getting better with tech let's just hope
21:07 they keep getting better it doesn't work
21:09 and so but if we say what are the
21:14 necessary and sufficient criteria of a
21:16 civilization that doesn't self germinate
21:18 in the presence of the emerging power we
21:21 can actually identify what those
21:22 criteria are and they're actually things
21:23 that we can do then that becomes the
21:26 only mo that makes sentences working to
21:28 bring that about but then looking at the
21:31 current political climate looking at the
21:33 current kind of the leaders that we have
21:35 at the moment do you have any hope that
21:37 they are going to be equipped to bring
21:38 this about of course not because the
21:44 they are part of the system that is
21:47 obsoleting itself do you have a sense of
21:49 how that shifts then if they can't do it
21:50 I'll say things that everyone has
21:52 probably heard when Bucky fuller
21:54 famously said don't try to fight the
21:56 existing system or fix it just build a
21:57 new one that obsoletes it that it has
21:59 the right characteristics it's very much
22:01 that when we think about the the kind of
22:04 caterpillar to butterfly metamorphosis
22:06 inside the chrysalis it's not a
22:08 caterpillar or a butterfly it's goo
22:09 right and that goo phase that liminal
22:12 phase
22:14 the caterpillar is actually dying right
22:17 because the caterpillar doesn't just
22:18 lose weight and grow wings if you look
22:19 at it the the caterpillar has a genetic
22:23 code to go gather parts right to gather
22:26 minerals and amino acids and sugars that
22:28 are going to then be reassembled into a
22:31 butterfly if the if we were just looking
22:34 at the caterpillar and we didn't know
22:36 it's gonna butterfly and we were looking
22:38 at its getting bigger and it's eating
22:39 everything it's not pollinating anything
22:40 we would predict that it eats itself
22:42 into extinction except at a certain
22:44 point it gets rich enough blood
22:46 chemistry that it triggers this movement
22:47 into the chrysalis it starts to dissolve
22:49 it gets reorganized at a you know amino
22:53 acid level into something that now
22:55 pollinates the plants that the
22:56 caterpillar decimated across these vast
22:57 spaces and helps the evolution of the
22:59 whole system
23:00 the butterfly phase could not have been
23:02 predicted from the caterpillar phase and
23:05 the so if we look at capitalism in the
23:08 military industrial complex and all
23:10 those systems as gathering parts right
23:14 very much like the caterpillar was net
23:15 consumption very much like a fetuses in
23:17 utero the fetus couldn't go past 40
23:19 weeks 50 60 it dies and the mom dies but
23:21 it also couldn't come out much earlier
23:23 because it wasn't ready to make a phase
23:25 shift it comes out when it first can it
23:29 has finally evolved to the place that it
23:30 can actually do breast milk rather than
23:32 get food from the umbilical cord
23:33 directly but it also comes out when it
23:35 has to there's a fairly narrow window of
23:37 transition the same is true for an
23:38 animal developing inside of an eggshell
23:40 or a there's a finite amount of
23:41 resources and when it runs out it has to
23:43 emerge but that's also the first time
23:44 that it can emerge that system can
23:46 handle the transition so we see in
23:48 nature this kind of precedent that these
23:50 discrete nonlinear phase shifts because
23:53 there's a curve of in utero and then
23:54 there's a shift and then there's a curve
23:56 outside but that discrete phase shift
23:58 have come through the birth canal is
23:59 different than either the phase before
24:01 after so when you're asking like or any
24:05 of the caterpillar is going to be able
24:06 to do the pollination thing it's the
24:08 wrong question right like the the
24:11 problem that we see is the caterpillars
24:12 are eating everything that's true and
24:15 and that is to gather the resources that
24:18 get assembled in a fun for a
24:20 fundamentally different set of reasons
24:22 it's if we say how do we maintain
24:25 strategic competitive
24:27 that's what the leaders are trying to do
24:29 leader of a companies trying to maintain
24:30 strategic competitive advantages grants
24:32 the other companies a country is across
24:34 other countries but of course the moment
24:36 you have some sorts of asymmetric
24:37 advantage and you deploy at everybody
24:38 sees it reverse engineers it makes
24:40 modifications on it and you just up the
24:42 level of rivalry for the entire playing
24:45 field that itself is what is terminating
24:49 the seeking of strategic competitive
24:51 advantage the the rival risk dynamics
24:52 because that is what actually self
24:54 terminates with this level of power so
24:56 it's how do we take all the
24:57 technological capacity and start to use
24:59 it for something that is not trying to
25:01 have power over but to have strength to
25:04 not be deformed by other power and be
25:07 able to be anti rivalries and etc so if
25:12 there's a society we're going from this
25:14 sort of idea of the caterpillar to the
25:17 butterfly does that mean each individual
25:20 person has to go through that same shift
25:21 and if so what does that mean well how
25:24 does that look individually yes as
25:29 families and small groups of people yes
25:33 as communities villages tribes larger
25:38 groups of people yes all the way up to
25:40 everybody so individual and collective
25:45 sense making in choice making process an
25:47 individual is necessary but it's not
25:49 sufficient if you have a bunch of people
25:52 that are making sense on their own they
25:54 can never make sense of the complexity
25:55 of the whole world if they don't figure
25:56 out how to have meaningful collaborative
25:58 dynamics to other people and if they
26:00 have collaborative dynamics with some
26:01 but then not others and they get into a
26:03 competitive dynamic than the others
26:04 figure out how to disinfect so we either
26:08 figure out anti rivalries Omni
26:11 collaborative type dynamics or we cap
26:13 out at a level of collective
26:15 intelligence less than we need so as
26:19 individuals saying okay on my own I
26:24 don't know how to change macroeconomics
26:27 I don't know how to create whatever the
26:29 post democracy governance system is I
26:31 don't know how to make a closed-loop
26:32 materials economy what can I do to it
26:34 least be starting to become a citizen of
26:39 the future world myself
26:42 one thing I'd say is stop trying to win
26:47 at the dying game and not just the dying
26:51 game but the game that's killing
26:52 everything if you're still trying to win
26:53 at that game like you can't also claim
26:58 to take seriously anything meaningful
27:00 that's one thing and then also don't
27:04 just get stuck in being angry or
27:05 hopeless or just your own personal
27:07 development and go off to a Lotus Eater
27:09 thing like actually be dedicated to
27:12 progressively better figuring out what
27:14 you can do to make a new game it works
27:16 for everybody it sounds like there's a
27:18 kind of almost spiritual dynamic to it
27:20 in terms of getting past one's own ego
27:25 if you can't get along with your family
27:33 members and your ex-partners and you're
27:36 pretty sure that you're right about
27:37 things and they're wrong about things
27:38 and you think you have any idea of how
27:41 Israel and Palestine can get along or
27:43 how the US and China can get along you
27:44 are just silly and so you really don't
27:49 get to even have a idea about politics
27:53 if you don't actually know something in
27:55 an embodied sense around how to deal
27:57 with differences and how to yeah how did
28:01 how to do real conflict resolution so it
28:04 sounds a bit Jordan Peterson clean your
28:05 room pay attention to what you can pay
28:08 attention to before you try and fix
28:09 anything else foundations or foundations
28:12 those are important so the other
28:15 critical thing is that you can't assume
28:18 that other people are going to fix these
28:19 issues and you can just kind of chill in
28:20 the world will work out that also
28:23 doesn't mean that you should freak out
28:25 and go into it existential angst on
28:27 hyperdrive without knowing what to do
28:29 but to progressively lean in more and
28:32 say okay there's a path or we can make
28:37 it but it's not a given at all that we
28:38 do yet rather than ask whether we do or
28:41 not how do I help determine that we do
28:43 how can I engage and that will require
28:46 learning a bunch of that you don't
28:48 currently know and that maybe nobody has
28:50 synthesized well yet and that's what
28:53 being in imaginal
28:54 in the transition from caterpillar to
28:57 butterfly really means is taking some
28:59 empowered responsibility for being
29:01 someone who's recognizing that you can't
29:04 just run the instruction manual that was
29:06 given historically and the new
29:07 instruction manual doesn't exist yet and
29:09 it's actually the time of people in that
29:12 liminal phase is to work on developing
29:14 what is what are the new structures what
29:17 does that look like for an individual to
29:18 learn like if they say if someone
29:21 watching this would say okay right I
29:22 need to learn stuff what are those
29:24 things that we need to learn well some
29:26 people might have a very clear sense of
29:28 in the picture of all that needs done
29:30 working on the future of Education and
29:32 how to facilitate the development of
29:34 young humans to be healthy sovereign
29:37 humans is really their focus and there's
29:39 certain things are going to focus on for
29:40 that or health care or the new materials
29:45 economy or whatever it is if one is
29:48 wanting to become comprehensively more
