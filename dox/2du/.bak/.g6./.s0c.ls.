  There might be overlooked nuance that could be worth recognition though as well. Pretty sure it was Sargon who quite recently discussed as actually
    stronger reason for banning it from Gab specifically was perceiving it as too much of a "gray area" or some shit because the prevailing conditioned
    disgust "protect children" response would be used like Adpocalypse to stifle, stigmatize, and/or sink the alternative platform. Possibly too hot of an
    easy target for massive collateral fallout, but yeah such pre-emptive capitulation highlights a crack in the consistency which channels the flood-gates
    for camouflaged coercion, compulsion, or pulverization.

  Anyway, maybe further subtleties shouldn't impact the thrust of your arguments here much, if at all. Just thought it might and you could judge yourself if
    this reached you. Please keep up all the great messages (and I guess predictions/prophecies since "I Told You So!" gloating can come off as pretty
    hilarious, beyond just bolstering your credibility)!

# IB8LEMAN:HTTPS://YouTu.be/eClzUI8CtbA "MGTOW: I like ya Phil but..." # 14m4s of EMAN67 discussing race-b8ing being used when female-supremacy more to blame:
  Thanks EMAN67! Solid message, for real bro. # Just posted this comment in his thread and thought it would be good to keep trying to preserve altern8 copies;
# While there surely exist severe (although usually concurrently quite exaggerated and sensationalized) social issues we don't know how to remedy well with
#   races and genders (and immigration, etc.), certainly imaginably with considerable overlap between them, conflating things or strategically redirecting
#   primary causes (... actually more charitably from respect for Phil, let's just say due to unconscious conditioning and biases, rather than deliberate
#   strategy) that are put forward to explain some particular anecdotal situation (admittedly this is also based on restricted and manipulated information,
#   as well as subjective impression and opinion)... well that just makes those and all surrounding problems worse. More complicated to raise tensions where
#   they don't belong (by false accusation or attribution), denying fair understanding and reckoning with accountability and meted justice for the more
#   significant origin of harm (in this case, probably lying gynocentrists or just narcissistic opportunistic groupies or whatever).
  Considering category and character, I think it might become increasingly legitimate to refer to feminists and conspicuous gynocentrists as not just sexist
    bigots, but also as "female-supremacists" actually too. ... Although does that just serve as a provocative reformulation of misandrists, yet subtler
    distinction (by reflecting their go-to language, like "toxic fem", etc.) obviously sharing predominant overlap with other such categorizations? That can
    be rhetorical contemplation, but it's possibly worth recognizing when their demonization of men (or whites...) categorically applies more credibly to
    themselves when they're unabashedly lying, cheating, stealing, and wounding for advantage (though this can only be highlighted broadly whenever they've
    been caught for doing so).
  Anyway, disproportionate convictions and sentence terms between races also seems to be obscured, since it's almost always easy to dive on either side of a
    case to discredit any "apples-to-apples" # theory. Harder to deflect from aggregated statistics across standardized populations. Maybe more complex,
    rather than merely complicated, problems emerge from our massive global human society, although plenty of design has still gone into battles for
    narrative and conflict which override evolved natures. Relatedly, but understanding if you merely meant it as sufficiently familiar contemporary
    demonstration of the disparity trend you were describing, why would you consider the cases between Cosby and Weinstein to deserve the same results for
    each? Just curious, if this hasn't been all TL;DR for whoever anyway.        GameGood! ;)        Genuinely, -Guy;

  @Marshall Mathers the 4th First of all, throwing around insults as carelessly as you seem eager to is not normally how the respectable brethers and
    sisters of StarShip LockJaw treat each other around here. Good-will, mutual respect, regard, and kindness tend to go much farther when you're trying to
    appeal to anyone's sympathies and potential generosity with their own hard-earned monies.
# Repeatedly insisting you've gone through only six years of teenage "*HELL*" (without providing abundant proof of having barely endured such persistent and
#   severe condition) is probably not an effective strategy for persuading many viewers to appreciate your circumstances as especially more difficult and dire
#   than their own recent and prevailing life-struggles.
  Disparaging successful achievers as "idiots", "ignorant", "arrogant", "pathetic", "assholes", or other ad hominem epithets is also probably a sub-optimal
    strategy, if you genuinely and deeply desire the ability to afford the expensive luxuries you mention. You end up looking like you're merely projecting
    your own qualifications for such labels since you're fundamentally failing to respect other people's time, consideration, and potential willingness to
    support you in some meaningful fashion (such as me likely wasting all this time typing my thoughts as though you deserve to be taken seriously).
# So, let's move on to my second major point: You should probably dedicate some serious time and effort in understanding that just as you have purportedly
#   suffered for years with an inability to earn extravagant amounts of money (extending into abject pessimism about your potential to ever amass such
#   significant sums, possibly due to lack of education, innate talents or skills, experience, dedication, manners, local opportunities, mobility, etc.), you
#   might come to recognize that it remains similarly difficult for the vast majority of us others out here to not only earn those same amounts, but then also
#   be easily capable of just gifting all that we've struggled and toiled for over to you... just because you obsess over selfish wants and desires.
  Why would you deserve the fruits of other people's labor, without providing them something of comparable value in return?
# Okay, so sort of getting into a third topic here (building on the above two): Attempt to heed advice when it's offered compassionately, and may actually
#   progress you closer to achieving your most ambitious long-term goals. For example, BasedShaman and tons of regular content-producers (as well as pretty
#   hardcore gamers) succeed quite well with $1200 desktop PCs. Take a step-wise approach. Save up for the awesome PlayStation2 or Wii consoles you can find
#   bundled with phenomenally fun used game bundles on EBay or CraigsList for only a couple hundred bucks. Work your way up to the latest and greatest BluRay
#   and 4K consoles, projectors, laptops, and workstations. Start humbly and realistically. Prioritize, plan, and build your way up.
  Now my fourth and final topic is about explanation, reason, justification, and determination: Why are you convinced that you require a $9000 gaming laptop
    or a $20,000 power-house PC before you can get a job and begin earning your own legitimate income from gainful employment?
# Carefully describing why such seemingly unreasonable pre-conditions would need to be met before you could sustain work (apart from angst-ridden repetitive
#   appeals for donations out of pity) would probably go a long way toward arguing for why your particular experience of "*HELL*" could warrant such grandiose
#   accommodations.
  Want and desire alone, combined with unreasonable impatience and being consumed and paralyzed by despair about how ultimately unattainable your possibly
    ridiculous dreams must always remain for you (especially while that very fixation demonstrates your unwillingness or inability to make even tiny steps of
    progress and savings which could compound) should be honestly reflected upon as predominantly insufficient for you to behave as though you're entitled to
    the riches rewards without putting your own "nose-to-the-grindstone" so-to-speak. Damn! Maybe that phrase won't make sense to a young lost soul, like
    yourself. Set yourself to the tasks at hand. Develop monetizable skills in a trade. Take pride in your work. Become punctual and polite. Track your
    progress and adjust your prioritized goals realistically in ways that appropriately reward each milestone you achieve.
# You would probably do well to listen to every YouTube video you can find of Dr. Jordan B. Peterson's lectures, advice, and interviews as well. He's a
#   great resource for understanding your own psychology, strengths, successes, and how to take on character-building small steps toward responsibility that

# IBNL0rEl:
Hello Thomas.

Firstly, I'd like to thank you for all the phenomenally intriguing and informative material you are constantly producing and providing. While it seems I have always exhibited tendencies to question and challenge complex issues in ways which appear comparable to you (including substantial overlap between the primary topics we each have determined to be most pressing and worthy of careful contemplation), I must admit that your increasing influence on my recent thinking has highlighted an astonishing number of profound topics that you demonstrate having extensive experience with, confidence about, and adeptness amidst, as well as your intuitions, interpretations, and perspectives on so many things which I have never before been properly introduced to, informed consistently about, or come to understand in any meaningful sense which could impact the applicability of my superficial analyses. I have only barely begun to comprehend so many of your topics, explanations, and advice, so I am reasonably anticipating a great deal of further learning to be necessary before I might become capable of adequately evaluating and embracing (or instead carefully and competently disputing) any of your various conclusions.

I simply have an immense amount of unfamiliar things I will need to learn about. It's easily intimidating in diverse and discouraging ways, but I am endeavoring to become much better informed about everything, in spite of these. I recognize you are popular and busy, so it's pretty unlikely you'll become able to respond to me directly here... but just in case you should, please forgive my obvious failure to understand the vast majority of deep things you say, mean, and imply with all your messages. I'm trying to learn everything that could describe reality, truth, values, and ethics... as well as any fictions which could prove worthwhile when trying to anticipate (and effectively adapt to) likely impending changes to the ways that any of those are and have been.

There are so many things that I may just need to shotgun crap into a draft form for now, until I can more meticulously revisit all your words and revise my quandaries to coherently correspond with the sequencing and contexts from your original message...

like my shifting imagination about what you mean by "collective unconscious", the confusing personal encounter example, the idea that maybe "subconscious" would be more descriptive of your intent...

that the birthing pains and skin-shedding should overwhelmingly (or just usually) be embraced to bring about beneficial (i.e., better adapted to newer realities, partially by being more sustainable) new forms of emerging (freshly immature and consequently vulnerable) life...

that Trump is akin to USA's evil shadow or Luciferian as both bad and good or what? ...

that magic is somehow more than sustainable societal superstition and pattern-matching over coincidences which are heavily reliant on cherry-picking what's considered contextual, consequential, convenient, and confirmation of calculations indicating the theoretical improbability of any such conspicuous confluence... but instead magic is real and credible, has evidence, is potent, should be believed, understood, and explored and experimented with cautiously, etc. ...

Damn! I had so many other thoughts that seemed worth questioning, but I've forgotten them for now... so they can hopefully be rediscovered again later, after another viewing? At least some of the important ones have started to be elaborated in this draft here, so it's probably a decently good start... and already like way too fucking lengthy to deal with very well, much less to expand upon far further, but oh well, such is life!

Oh, yeah, the individuality versus collective suicide NPC meat-golem stuff too. ... aliens, schizophrenia, hallucinations, sky lights, intuition, globalism, rates-of-change, survivability, sustainability, individual vs. collective, religions, autonomy, etc. ... Trump necessary Luciferian attenuator needed for this moment? ...

Any help clarifying any of this stuff would be greatly appreciated!

Genuinely,
-Guy
HTTPS://BitChute.Com/video/pu12mu9LDRmU "Why Do Evolutionists Refuse to Debate YECs? (Justin Derby)" # J1QL4YEC:12m3s seems probably not worth anyone's time.
#   comment submit said: "/!\ You must authenticate the user or provide author_name and author_email" probably through separate Disqus, but just how though?;
While the accuracy of any estimate of the age of the Earth or Universe is not a particularly significant issue for me in general, such topics become slightly compelling when contextualized according to the implications and ramifications such distinctions can have on identity, worldview, religion, etc. so I mustered a bit of curiosity and an attempt at open-mindedness to consider this video as potentially informative, insightful, or otherwise worthwhile (at least by being probably pretty representative of premium YEC material).

After enduring this whole thing, I am rather disappointed and frustrated for many reasons. First, I usually like and thumbs-up any video that seemed to have been worth making and watching (regardless of ideological alignment with my own present views, so maybe I just liked the high or low production values or some other creative element working well with the material). My standards have remained pretty low, so it's always a bit distressing to me to realize that another rare video enticed me in, but then felt like a waste. I generally only reserve down-votes for the extremely rare time-wasters which seem to have no redeeming qualities to rise from my abyss of the "worst" (which must still appear credible enough to deserve any deliberate feedback at all). This video got worrisome down there, but I decided to comment this instead of down-voting.

Of course if I felt compelled to be thorough (like if I had been more invested in the topic), I'd need to repeat my viewing (maybe fine-toothed combing) to cover all my conflicts, but since I can't care right now enough to suffer more, hopefully limited recall of my first impressions can suffice to convey my most apparent criticisms and contentions.

Way too fucking redundant! OMG! How many times can you slowly repeat the same message as though doing so adds fresh emphasis and somehow strengthens your arguments more than undermining them? Tedious. Trite. Tawdry.

"I know you are, but what am I? I know you are..."  -PeeWee

Maybe YECs and whatever evolutionists and atheists are under consideration here are actually similar in many ways, both capable of projecting their own faults (whether wrongly or rightly) onto subsets (probably cherry-picked) among their adversaries. You could all be disingenuous and retarded in multifaceted ways. Overwhelming some debate opponent under time constraints is not some strategy which is exclusive to whatever side of any broader argument. Neither is focusing singularly and stubbornly.

Get over your glib jackass self-certainty! Human minds have limits and failures (regardless of whether you believe some to be moved by Holy Spirits or whatever).

Your anecdotal experiences are sorely inadequate to demonstrate vast trends or truth. Just because you claim to only find liars among your debate partners, this has little bearing on whether your side has ultimately been pushing more lies than the other. If you jump from something like "every atheist I have debated ..." to generalizing "therefore fair to conclude most or all atheists ..." there's a pretty significant chance you're extrapolating beyond your capacity incoherently.

If whatever side of some debate remains subversive to the ideal pursuit of truth, sabotaging point-scoring more through procedural strategy than elucidating salient arguments according to significance, then "you'll probably lose" can easily be understood to be accurate for both sides, just probably along differing vectors. If the best your side can strive for is some satisfying audience sympathy or denying that from your opponents or whatever, then couching that in the presumed context of a debate toward truths might be damn disingenuous of you too.

Just because some college students at some school over 22 years ago might have been out-numbered or otherwise out-matched by some presumably well-established student organization in opposition were cautioned that "they would probably lose debates" does not mean this will always be the case everywhere. So ridiculous for you to latch onto probably idiosyncratic campus minutia, decontextualize it, provide counter-example anecdotes, then conclude none can confront you forthrightly because your side monopolizes truth somehow. Just because your side might be right and seems right in particular debate circumstances, this does not mean everyone can expect that to always be the case.

You've said too much stupid shit too many times for me to go into further depth now. I've gifted you way more of my time than you've earned. Maybe I'll be willing to reflect, review, and dive deeper if anyone decides to discuss matters further in this comment section with some mind to truth and prioritized pursuit of anything poignant.

I doubt any prevalent concept of "God" could, should, or would exist in reality. I'm open to the idea that our home planet here might be less than 10,000 years old, but I strongly lean toward probably many orders of magnitude older based on whatever information and mis-information has made sense to me so far. Assuming we could perfectly pinpoint exactly 10 thousand or 10 billion (and momentarily ignoring the knock-on consequences associated), does either differ much from the other as viewed through our contemporary minuscule evolving human perspective?

If this is near the best of what YECs do in debates, they might deserve to be mostly ignored by both atheists and sympathetic audiences alike. Modern MGTOW seems superior to TradCon in most ways to a man like me. To all those who pursue truth honestly, I hope we all keep finding and cataloging much more of it!

Genuinely,  -Guy
HTTPS://BitChute.Com/video/VUqDIys_Jmc "UbiSoft Forced to Change Assassin's Creed Odyssey by SJW's" # J1QLABAD:11m47s of JeremyHambly TheQuartering comments:
 "notadegenerate"                • 15 hours ago: "Bring back mental institutions for these people" 2  
   "6th Gen" => "notadegenerate" • 10 hours ago: "I really do miss there being places to put these people away from the rest of us." # I wanted to reply with:
While no longer as typical to refer to them as an "Insane Asylum", modern hospitals usually have locked-down floors, wings, or wards devoted to treating psychosis. These are "mental institutions" which liberally corral, tackle, and force-inject potent "medication cocktails" into any of their patients / prisoners deemed in any way uncooperative or non-compliant with staff demands or expectations. This likelihood approaches near certainty if such an ill person gets stuck with labels for being potentially violent or otherwise dangerous. Such "treatment" (as well as a wide array of comparable demonstrations of power through intimidation, coercion, bribery, restraint, isolation, injury, assault, etc.) commonly enlists some private "Security Force" to manage the initial stages of administering of it.

As might seem apparent, I know several people pretty well who have been forced into mental hospitals (in the U.S.) many times and can still vividly recall cruelly pervasive, unavoidable, and traumatic conditions, circumstances, and confrontations they endured within these institutions. They can sound like unimaginably harsh and hostile places for people who were probably already suffering pretty damn severely, well before they were shackled and transported there for "care".

As I understand it, there are usually a set of around 4 common criteria that are measured ahead of qualification to force a person into such "places to put these people away from the rest of us" according to presumed or perceived mental illness. These could be summarized as:

  1) Is this individual a danger to themself?
  2) Is this individual a danger to others?
  3) Are they gravely disabled?
  4) Are there 3 close family members, neighbors, friends, etc. who agree they should be committed?

Of course I'm probably conspicuously unmeasured with such a clinical response, taking you far too seriously when you're just making a basic joke or venting about how easy things might seem if society could still flippantly imprison categories of enemies who threaten the fabric and edifices of the West by their collective delusions and gyrations... but it clearly rubbed me the wrong way to consider your literal message that you "miss" what we still have much as it was. I'm defensive of my friends, so probably over-sensitive about such "institutions" being capable of only locking away "bad" people. Sue me?  ;)
