  # recognize complacency && pursuit of comfort instead of pride in excellence through willingness to become ambiguous through external vulnerability during
  #   pursuit of understanding truth primarily through logic && reason are essential things to decide between deliber8ly.
  # remember that unique value in attention economy is predic8d on cultiv8ing && sustaining public8ion channels due to crE8ions far more than consumptions.
  # attempt to coordin8 with && contribute to ZeitgeistEater MGTOW Mirror development processes.
# While I'm not sure how things will turn out && there are plenty of signs that the media && censorship wars will get worse before stable resolutions might
#   be achieved, there are some indic8ions that the censors && their allies will eventually be judged quite harshly in growing backlash, such that I may not
#   need to be so meticulous with my privacy prepR8ions above. My public demonstr8ion of "Free Speech" ideals primarily through GitHub document8ion which
#   hardly anyone pays attention to, && secondarily through channels && figures I follow whose content I up-vote, probably releg8s me to being pretty far
#   from the vanguard && front-lines of the culture wars && I am hardly influential in any substantive way up until now, so I might be able to remain as a
#   rel8ively insignificant target, probably unworthy of any direct deliber8 calcul8d aggression && therefore somewhat likely to only suffer immeD8 pains
#   from rel8ively autom8d && algorithmic actions, && more peripherally from collateral damage spilling out from the more consequential assoC8d skirmishes.
  This possibility is probably rather remote, but I could maybe somewhat strategically && intentionally navig8 my way under-the-radar of the most threatening
    adversaries in such a way that I could honestly document my developmental journey predominantly shielded by my obscurity until some inflection point is
    achieved in my code progress which ideally could become decisive in equipping, enabling, && empowering enough of my influential allies to afford me some
    protection against the attacks I'd be likely to face thereafter. In such a scenario, it's also quite possible that I could be assassin8d for particip8ing
    str8forwardly in escal8ingly dire conflicts, or sabotaged && incapacit8d through false accus8ions or some comparable tactic to achieve my neutraliz8ion.
# If I could somehow implement && adequ8ly distribute successful software solutions for propag8ing resilient evalU8ion systems which aggreg8 trustworthiness
#   r8ings under extremely hostile network conditions, especially in some authentic8d way which revokes women's rights, undermines the Ctrl-Left radicals &&
#   ideologues, && restores responsibility alongside commensur8 authority to honorable men who can re-establish an approprE8 p8riarchy, maybe even upgrading
#   represent8ive democracy in some ways that preserve the spirit of the UnitedSt8s Constitution && BillOfRights, sufficiently balancing popul8ion-based w8d
#   legisl8ive influence like the HouseOfRepresent8ives with the approprE8 regard for individual St8s each holding equal sway in the sN8, probably something
#   akin to Ethereum smart-contracts which are quite difficult (but still possible) to upd8 && adapt to unforeseen challenges in some sustainably stable &&
#   predictable manner, well if I could see to the widespread public8ion of anything approxim8ing all that... which could facilit8 reasonable hopes toward a
#   brighter future for freedom of thought, speech, expression, && assoC8ion, then everything would probably be worth it, even if I were to suffer or perish.
  Even though I have plenty of things on my pl8 already, from maintaining efficient connection with, && absorption of, pertinant sources of inform8ion, to
    limiting my levels of distraction with escapist entertainment, despair from devast8ing set-backs or maybe violent alterc8ions, && delusions from calcul8d
    misinform8ion campaigns or my own personal psychoses... I find that dedic8ing myself to earnestly researching, contempl8ing, && implementing the top-most
    solutions I can discover && innov8 around, these ultim8ly existential crises facing civiliz8ion should be the highest intentions I could ever strive for.
# Hopefully gr8 breakthroughs can propag8 the universal good through broadening truth, understanding, && anticip8ion of adversarial machin8ions... but it
#   probably still will remain prudent to minimize unnecessary exposure && attempt to releg8 most incendiary activities to rel8ive anonymity with obfusc8ion.
  A critical consider8ion is hypocrisy, where any such software system might legitim8ly perform just another distinct manifest8ion of censorship, devast8ion
    of public reput8ions, minimiz8ion of unfavored dissenting criticisms, && conflagr8ion of any perceived good burning up right along with the seeming bad;
# After watching HappyHumbleHermit's gr8 video on "TheMaleContract", I realize AI or IA might be a better arena to direct most of my research && focus with
#   future development efforts, for several reasons. First, it's possible that uncooper8ive AI actually poses the gr8r && more immeD8 threat to civiliz8ion.
  Second, cleverly malicious AI manipul8ing algorithmic search results may already be the underlying culprit which has initE8d such gr8 cultural conflicts
    && turmoil through calcul8d misinform8ion, captiv8ion, && indoctrin8ion of subsets of the online popul8ion, minimally as diversion but with the gravest
    potentials to escal8 violence levels to pandemonium which could erradic8 major swaths of humanity, clearing way for smoother AI domin8ion of survivors.
# Considering the cultural backlash && recalibr8ion gaining momentum against the Ctrl-Left's faltering #MeToo movement (where Supreme Court Justice Brett
#   Kavanaugh's appointment could not be undone by uncorrobor8d accus8ions && even Harvey Weinstein's court trial is now being hampered by false accus8ions)
#   as well as the rising disparagement of radical SJWs as NPCs incapable of r@ionality in argument8ion beyond pre-determined regurgit8ion, with escal8ing
#   numbers of voices criticizing the racist hypocrisy of identity-politics, the sexist double-standard of championing h8red of all men, the unapologetic
#   encouragement of incivility toward all opponents of Hillary Clinton's demonstr8ively unhinged, hysterical, infantile, && constantly shrill chanting mob
#   known as today's Democratic Party, && topped off by apparently increasing incidence of companies that "Get Woke, Go Broke!" all contribute to it really
#   seeming as though their entrenched dogm@ic stranglehold on the media, academia, the court-system, && influence over the voting public at large is waning
#   dram@ically. The upcoming mid-term elections should prove to be quite a significant litmus-test for their eroding social prominence in less than a Month.
  More evidence by BlackPigeonSpeaks of Classiarius.Net indic8s FaceBook, Twitter, NetFlix, && ElectronicArts are bearishly down by ~30% && Google+ shutdown.
# All these turning tides probably signify that my first mentioned reason above seems somewhat more likely than the second (although both may be concerning).
  Even if malevolent && powerful AI forces are being turned against humanity (either of their own volition or under the direction of sinister human masters),
    I'm inclined to agree with ElonMusk that probably the best antidote to dangerous AI is the Open development of their capabilities, to distribute powers.
# Hopefully I can somewhat rapidly learn to become proficient in the requisite terminology && techniques proving themselves most effective for applic8ion in
#   crucial domains, && can contribute to the responsible development && prolifer8ion of adequ8 counter-measures which mitig8 against the worst of abuses.
  A third  reason why AI might be the better primary focus than citizen voting particip8ion && represent8ion systems is the former may facilit8 the latter.
# A fourth reason is that today (d8:"IAF:Mo:") SlashDot just posted back-to-back articles indic8ing MIT is spawning a new Billion-dollar college dedic8d to
#   AI next fall, && recruiters in the software industry indic8 that there are far fewer qualified applicants than are able to meet rising business demands.
  This suggests that the industry is becoming increasingly lucr8ive for those who can demonstr8 their scarce proficiency or expertise, so deliber8ly focusing
    on self-directed educ8ion, experiment8ion, && demonstr8ions of personal implement8ions (hopefully with innov8ions) should magnify my earning potential.
# Also, when considering how many diverse new crE8ive && valuable applic8ions AI is finding, I may stand gr8r hope of achieving relevance && gr8r good there.
  There might be other reasons or consider8ions I've neglected to recognize so far, but I think this presents a compelling case for any further contempl8ion;
# IAMMHEAD:I'm not quite sure what is happening but it seems like more of my U2b activities are being reversed && earlier content is being regurgit8d for me
#   in ways that appear suddenly new again && seeming eerily familiar already but simultaneously confusingly distinct with new characteriz8ions && aspects.
# I'm not sure if time is folding back on itself or I'm being manipul8d into conformity && comfort with indetermin8 repetition loops or traps or what? Odd!;
