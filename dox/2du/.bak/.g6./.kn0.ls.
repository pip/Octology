From The Collabor8ive Intern@ional Dictionary of English v.0.48 [gcide]: Obligor \Ob`li*gor"\, n. The person who binds himself, or gives his bond to another.
From Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Revised 6th Ed (1856) [bouvier]: # below Louis.   Code,art.3522,No.12.      # above is from:      --Blackstone. [1913 Webster]
  OBLIGOR or DEBTOR. Person who engaged to perform an oblig8ion. Word obligor,   in more technical signific8ion, is applied to design8 one who makes a bond.
       2. Obligors are joint and several. They are joint when they agree to      pay the obligation jointly, and then the survivors only are liable upon it
  at law, but in equity the assets of a deceased joint obligor may be reached.   1. Bro. C. R. 29; 2 Ves. 101; Id. 371. They are several when one or more
  bind themselves each of them separately to perform the obligation. In order    to become an obligor, the party must actually, either himself or by his
  attorney, enter into the obligation, and execute it as his own. If a man       sign and seal a bond as his own, and deliver it, he will be bound by it,
  although his name be not mentioned in the bond.4 Stew.R.479;4 Hayw R.239;4     McCord,R.203;7 Cowen;R.484;2 Bail.R.190;Brayt.38;2 H.&M.398;5 Mass.R.538;2

       3. The execution of a bond by the obligor with a blank, and a verbal      authority to fill it up, and it is afterwards filled up, does not bind the
  obligor,unless it's redelivered,or acknowledged or adopted. 1 Yerg.R.69 149;   1 Hill,Rep.267;2 N.&M.125;2 Brock.R.64;1 Ham.R.368;2 Dev.R.369 6 Gill.&Jo...

  "Fish With Cat As A Tongue": (16h ago) As a veteran of underground secret societies, I'd like to give tips for you guys to better manage your secret society.
  Before I get into that, we need to ask ourselves if having a secret society is actually worth it in this day and age. Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. Where are
    your fingers? Seriously. It's a pretty easy question. You should be able to answer it. But how do you know? How does anyone know anything?
  You might say, well, I know where my fingers are. I'm looking right at them. Or, I can touch them, I can feel them, they're right here and that's good. Your
    senses are a great way to learn things. In fact, we have way more than the usual five senses we talk about. For instance, your kinesthetic sense,
    proprioception. This is what the police evaluate during a field sobriety test. It allows you to tell where your fingers and arms and head and legs in your
    body is all in relation to each other without having to look or touch other things. We have way more than five senses, we have at least twice as many and
    then some. But they're not perfect.
  There are optical illusions, audio illusions, temperature sensation illusions, even tactile illusions. Can you turn your tongue upside down? If so, perfect.
    Try this. Run your finger along the outer edge of the tip of your upside down tongue. Your tongue will be able to feel your finger, but in the wrong place.
    Our brains never needed to develop an understanding of upside down tongue touch. So, when you touch the right side of your tongue when it's flipped over to
    your left side you perceive a sensation on the opposite side, where your tongue usually is but isn't when it's upside down. It's pretty freaky and cool and
    a little humbling, because it shows the limits of the accuracy of our senses, the only tools we have to get what's out there in here.
  The philosophy of knowledge, the study of knowing, is called epistemology. Plato famously said that the things we know are things that are true, that we
    believe and that we have justification for believing. those justifications might be irrational or they might be rational, they might be based on proof, but
    don't get too confident because proven is not a synonym for true. Luckily, there are things that we can know without needing proof, without needing to even
    leave the house, things that we can know as true by reason alone. These are things that we know a priori. An example would be the statement "all bachelors
    are unmarried." I don't have to go survey every bachelor on earth to know that that is true. All bachelors are unmarried because that's how we define the
    word bachelor. Of course, you have to know what the words bachelor and unmarried mean in the first place. Oh, you do? Okay. Perfect. That's great. But how
    do you know?
  This time I mean functionally, how do you know? Where is knowledge biologically in the brain? What are memories made out of? We are a long way from being
    able to answer that question completely but research has shown that memories don't exist in the brain in single locations. Instead, what we call a memory
    is likely made up of many different complex relationships all over the brain between lots of brain cells, neurons. A major cellular mechanism thought to
    underlie the formation of memories is long-term potentiation or LTP. When one neuron stimulates another neuron repeatedly that signal can be enhanced
    overtime LTP, wiring them more strongly together and that connection can last a long time, even an entire lifetime. A collection of different brain cells,
    neurons that fire together in a particular order over and over again frequently and repeatedly can achieve long-term potentiation, becoming more sensitive
    to each other and more ready to fire in the exact same way later on in the future. They're a physical thing in your brain, firing together more easily
    because you strengthen that pattern of firing. You memorized. This branching forest of firing friends looks messy, but look closer. It could be the memory
    of your first kiss. A living souvenir of the event. If I were to go into your brain and cut out those cells, could I make you forget your first kiss or
    could I make you forget where your fingers are? Only if I cut out a lot of your brain. Because memories aren't just stored in one relationship, they're
    stored all over the brain. The events leading up to your first kiss are stored in one network, the way it felt to the way it smelled in different networks,
    all added up together making what you call the memory of your first kiss.
  How many memories can you fit inside your head? What is the storage capacity of the human brain? The best we can do is a rough estimate, but given the number
    of neurons in the brain involved with memory and the number of different connections a single neuron can make Paul Reber at Northwestern University
    estimated that we can store the digital equivalent of about 2.5 petabytes of information. That's the equivalent of recording a TV channel continuously for
    300 years. That's a lot of information. That is a lot of information about skills you can do and facts and people you've met, things in the real world. The
    world is real, right? How do you know?
  It's a difficult question, but it's not rocket science. Instead, it is asking whether or not rocket scientists even exist in the first place. The theory that
    the Sun moved around the earth worked great. It predicted that the Sun would rise every morning and it did. It wasn't until later that we realized what we
    thought was true might not be. So, do we or will we ever know true reality or are we stuck in a world where the best we can do is be approximately true?
    Discovering more and more useful theories every day but never actually reaching true objective actual reality. Can science or reason ever prove
    convincingly that your friends and YouTube videos and your fingers actually exist beyond your mind? That you don't just live in the matrix?
  No. Your mind is all that you have, even if you use instruments, like a telescope or particle accelerators. The final stop for all of that information is
    ultimately you. You are alone in your own brain, which technically makes it impossible to prove that anything else exists. It's called the egocentric
    predicament. Everything you know about the world out there depends on and is created inside your brain. This mattered so much to Charles Sanders Peirce
    that he drew a line between reality, the way the universe truly is, and what he called the phaneron, the world as filtered through our senses and bodies,
    the only information we can get. If you want to speak with certainty you live in, that is you react to and remember and experience your phaneron, not
    reality. The belief that only you exist and everything else, food, the universe, your friends are all figments of your mind is called solipsism. There is
    no way to convince a solipsist that the outside world is real. And there is no way to convince someone who doubts that the universe wasn't created just
    three seconds ago along with all of our memories. It's a frightening realization that we don't always know how to deal with. There's even The Matrix
    defense.
  In 2002 Tonda Lynn Ansley shot and killed her landlady. She argued that she believed she was in the matrix, that her crimes weren't real. By using the matrix
    defense, she was found not guilty by reason of insanity, because the opposite view is just way healthier and common. It's called realism. Realism is the
    belief that the outside world exists independently of your own phaneron. Rocks and stars and Thora Birch would continue to exist even if you weren't around
    to experience them. But you cannot know realism is true. All you can do is believe.
  Martin Gardner, a great source for math magic tricks, explained that he is not a solipsist because realism is just way more convenient and healthy and it
    works. As to whether it bothered him that he could never know realism was true, he wrote, "If you ask me to tell you anything about the nature of what lies
    beyond the phaneron, my answer is how should I know? I'm not dismayed by ultimate mysteries, I can no more grasp what is behind such questions as my cat
    can understand what is behind the clatter I make while I type this paragraph." Humble stuff. What strikes me is the cat.
  Cats do not understand keyboards, but they know the keyboards are a fun place to be. It's a great way to get the attention of a human, they're warm and
    exciting, surrounded by noises and flashing lights plus cats love to get their scent on whatever they can, a mark of their existence. We aren't that much
    different, except instead of keyboards we have the mysteries of the universe. We will never be able to understand all of them.
  We won't be able to ever answer every single question, but walking around in those questions, exploring them, is fun. It feels good. And as always, thanks
    for watching. Do you want more unanswered questions? Well, you're in luck. Today, nine other amazing channels on YouTube have made videos about questions
    we still haven't fully answered. Alltime10s has organized them and to watch them all click the annotation at the end of this video or the link at the top

  "Techlore"  Published on Nov 6, 2017  # video was also downloaded locally, but inform8ion is by now nearly 1 Year old
  Video tutorial showing how to become anonymous, hide you internet traffic and identity, and browse the web freely without any fear of privacy invasion or any
    security concerns from your Government, school, or organization (NSA, CIA, FBI). Going off the grid and becoming fully anonymous (hiding your online
    identity) is not 100% possible, because of how the internet works, but we can do everything we possibly can to get as close as possible to anonymous. In
    this video guide, I will show you how to secure all of your devices--such as computers, phones (iPhone vs Android), tablets, and anything else, by securing
    your passwords, using two factor authentication, securing your web browsers (Mozilla Firefox & Tor), using a VPN (NordVPN or AirVPN), securing social media
    (Facebook, Snapchat), your communication like texting and email (Signal and Protonmail encrypted messengers), your operating system (Linux), and much much
    more! I will also cover deleting a majority of your online identity/fingerprint to hide as much information about you as possible, in addition to give you
    tips on how to prevent social engineering attacks.
  URGENT: This guide has A LOT of room for improvement, and I have made sure to update it. If you're interested in learning about EVERYTHING you need to know
    about security, privacy, and anonymity--check out Go Incognito, a free and in-depth course taking you from start to finish: https://youtube.com/playlist...
  Now, some of you may ask why? Well, at a basic level, your privacy is constantly invaded by the websites you visit, your ISP, your government, your
    school/employer, and even services you use like Google or Facebook. Everything you do is being tracked and we aren't quite sure what consequences may
    result out of all of this data being created out of us. Some people also fear certain things like doxing, and other forms of leaks of your personal
    information. It is also common for corporations to sell your data for a profit, which is a complete violation of your privacy.

  Oh, now it's starting - the branding of mgtow. MGTOW is unkillable, cause it's just a cesspool of ideas. So how do we kill it? Simple. Do what women do
    best. Make it killable. Make a visible group out of the philosophy, make it 'comfortable' for supposed 'centrists' to 'hang out'. If there's no group to
    begin with, pretend like there is. Ignore facts, logic doesn't matter, what they 'feel' about the current situation is important. Resort to shaming, when
    there's no good argument. Use these words like 'misogny', 'women hater', 'sexist', 'bitter', 'going too far' like it mean something. If your argument is
    debunked,that'll be the ultimate proof that this 'group' is full of h8.Rinse&repeat,&mgtow as once a helpful philosophy for men,will be dead in no time.
  Gentleman,please.Don't be fooled by these con-artists.Don't feed these parasites what they want.MGTOW is not a group. It's bunch of ideas under that name.

  The writer's complaints are all rather strange, and pose an unwilling juxtaposition with his claim to be red-pilled. Frankly, without intending to insult
    the man in any way - they sound more like what a woman would write - attempting to co-opt the forum to better satiate his feelings. Out of my favorite
    MGTOW channels - Sunrise Hoodie, Happy Humble Hermit, Turd Flinging Monkey, Spetsnaz, ImmortalMindz, Bar Bar etc - most of them have said unsettling or
    challenging things at one time or another, and I would not have it any other way. # ~"Have your own MGTOW interpret8ion, varE8ion, && convers8ion!"~ -SH
# As such, whenever I hear a complaint that I cannot make sense of, I look at the person making the complaint, and try to discern his/her motivations. As he
#   said, he is married (?) with a daughter - and yet claims to be MGTOW. Everything he wrote seems to be trying to protect what may be an illusion, for the
#   sake of his own peace of mind at having discovered the red pill post-marriage/relationship. I imagine it would be obvious to most thinking humans that in
#   any group, you will get extremely disagreeable people assume the moniker and who - naturally - say extremely disagreeable things.
  After all, you rarely hear mainstream feminists quote Andrea Dworkin - even though some of the things she said before she unceremoniously shuffled off

    actualiz8ion from huMAN, or 1 about MGTOW & finding your purpose from Hoodie? Take that stuff to the MRA movement - they'll lend you an ear. # HoodiesUp;
