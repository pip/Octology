  Description_: (supporting MarkDown)
# Octology
This talk is about an unimaginably ambitious project which aims to become a rigorous ontology by which all future comput8ion could be subsumed.

## DownLoad
It is presently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/pip/Octology) and [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/octology) with intention to prepare it for a [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/author/PIP) release within June of 2021 (8 years after it was essentially started).

## Instal8n
The above linked Git repositories are meant to be installed into (or copied over) almost any existing GNU/Linux `$HOME` directory (where a modern Perl 5 and a few other prerequisites could be found in the `$PATH`).

## dMonstr8
During this talk, I will be demonstr8ing many Perl scripts which generally adhere to the Unix Philosophy (attempting to do *at-least* one thing well and to be nicely interoperable).

My name is Pip (and if you think of the Python Install8ion Program, you're not alone, but might find my aversion to whitespace quite stunning and in stark contrast). I am the spots on dice, dominos, and the suits on playing cards. Octology includes code to manipul8 each of those for innumerable types of games. There's also an interactive mechanism for showing A-Star path-finding in tons of [Screeps](https://screeps.com) Real-Time-Strategy game maps. You'll be introduced to a fE8ure-rich varE8ion on the classic game of Chess called `ckm8` (which only has a couple minor bugs left to squash yet). There's a Rubik's Cube spoonerism called `qbix` which renders in Curses text-mode.

I will be starting things off by running my elabor8 alias `ti` which is an abbreV8ion for "Terminal-Initializ8ion" that popul8s my 8 virtual desktops with myriad Gnome-Terminal applic8ions (with slightly transparent backgrounds which depend on the Compiz compositing within the Unity desktop-environment, so you can see some of the content below when my terminals are overlapping each other directly). I will demonstr8 my `trmz` Zsh alias which colorfully lists dozens of other terminal applic8ions which you too can easily have at your disposal. A guiding principle of Octology is to attempt to always provide at least 2 (and 8 even better) ways to accomplish whatever task you wish to accomplish (even when it means reinventing multiple wheels, exhibiting varying levels of roundness).

Next, I will run `sumb` which SUMmarizes Octology's ~/bin/ directory with autom8d color8ion of detailed descriptions of the wide array of over 122 different utility programs. They are organized by the ~/lib/Octology/ Perl-Modules that they are most assoC8d with. a8 is the most fundamental base-level module which Autom8s the exporting of An Awesome Array of variables, d8a-structures, and functions which are used heavily throughout the rest of the system. b8 is the Base-transl8ion module which also incorpor8s many templ8 examples of useful mathematical comput8tions and serial progressions. c8 is a Complex Collection of the Command-line Cat and Cut programs as well as Curses-like SDL graphical functionality which favors tied-arrays as ways to manipul8 Columns of Colorful text in 64 (8-squared) different `.f0nt` formats. d8 is the module which gener8s and manipul8s 8-character time-stamps which exhibit sub-second precision which is employed for timing purposes throughout Octology. f8 is the module which handles `.f0nt` and `.pal8` files for classic bitmapped easily customizable characters and very terse color palettes. m8 is not an actual module yet, but is the eventual home for Mapping and graphing functionality which can encompass arbitrary edge rel8ionships between nodes and is already the umbrella under which Markup-rel8d utilities handling XML Mixed-node reformatting and binariz8ion. U8 is a module which handles some UTF-8 character-table gener8ion, code-file Upd8ing, and U2b (YouTube) video-file downloading, name reformatting, and transcript organiz8ion.

This talk will walk new users through the myriad efficient ways that Octology commands and utilities can optimize oper8or time and key-strokes to accomplish many useful tasks intuitively, via code which can be easily and rapidly modified to suit ever more specialized cases (once the shock of how dense it all is has worn off).

The finale will be demonstr8ing `8plc` which is Octology's Pre-cursor Letter Counter that processes the ~/dox/2du/8.utf file and the 1,391 8-words that are itemized within and reformul8s about 8 different ways to restructure the set of words to provide insight into interrel8ionships and correl8ions between altern8 perspectives on how such words can be constructed. This culmin8s in the 3 crosses from Calvary which came together during PassOver (just prior to Good Friday and Easter of this Year, 2020).

Elevator Pitch:
Care to learn an immense amount of Perl, GNU/Linux, Zsh, Vim, System-Administr8ion, minimal abbreV8ions, code condens8ion, diverse d8a-represent8ions, autom8d coloriz8ion, lossless conversions, math comput8ion, problem-solving, video-game development, etc. in an hour?! Then this is the talk for you!

Description
Octology
This talk is about an ambitious grandiose project which aims to become a rigorous ontology by which all future comput8ion could be subsumed. Almost everything in the known universe has already begun to be planned for l8r inclusion, according to coherent prioritiz8ion.

DownLoad
It is presently hosted on GitHub and SourceForge with intention to prepare it for a CPAN release before July of 2021 (8 years after it was essentially started).

Instal8n
The above linked Git repositories are meant to be installed into (or copied over) almost any existing GNU/Linux $HOME directory (where a modern Perl 5 and a few other prerequisites could be found in the $PATH).

dMonstr8
During this talk, I will be demonstr8ing many Perl scripts which generally adhere to the Unix Philosophy (attempting to do at-least one thing well and to be nicely interoperable).

My name is Pip (and if you think of the Python Install8ion Program, you're not alone, but might find my aversion to whitespace quite stunning and in stark contrast). I am the spots on dice, dominos, and the suits on playing cards. Octology includes code to manipul8 each of those for innumerable types of games. There's also an interactive mechanism for showing A-Star path-finding in tons of Screeps Real-Time-Strategy game maps. You'll be introduced to a fE8ure-rich varE8ion on the classic game of Chess called ckm8 (which only has a couple minor bugs left to squash yet). There's a Rubikâ€™s Cube spoonerism called qbix which renders in Curses text-mode.

I will be starting things off by running my elabor8 alias ti which is an abbreV8ion for "Terminal-Initializ8ion" that popul8s my 8 virtual desktops with myriad Gnome-Terminal applic8ions (with slightly transparent backgrounds which depend on the Compiz compositing within the Unity desktop-environment, so you can see some of the content below when my terminals are overlapping each other directly). I will demonstr8 my trmz Zsh alias which colorfully lists dozens of other terminal applic8ions which you too can easily have at your disposal. A guiding principle of Octology is to attempt to always provide at least 2 (and 8 even better) ways to accomplish whatever task you wish to accomplish (even when it means reinventing multiple wheels, exhibiting varying levels of roundness).

Next I will be showing off cJ and CJ which are d8a-processing scripts to aggreg8, summarize, and analyze CoViD-19 (where b64 19 is equal to b10 J). Hopefully these rel8ively simple scripts can provide some useful insights into infection and mortality r8s for various St8s of particular interest to users. I hope they can help (at least in some small way) to save lives and diminish suffering and stress.

Then, I will run sumb which SUMmarizes Octology's ~/bin/ directory with autom8d color8ion of detailed descriptions of the wide array of over 122 different utility programs. They are organized by the ~/lib/Octology/ Perl-Modules that they are most assoC8d with. a8 is the most fundamental base-level module which Autom8s the exporting of An Awesome Array of variables, d8a-structures, and functions which are used heavily throughout the rest of the system. b8 is the Base-transl8ion module which also incorpor8s many templ8 examples of useful mathematical comput8tions and serial progressions. c8 is a Complex Collection of the Command-line Cat and Cut programs as well as Curses-like SDL graphical functionality which favors tied-arrays as ways to manipul8 Columns of Colorful text in 64 (8-squared) different .f0nt formats. d8 is the module which gener8s and manipul8s 8-character time-stamps which exhibit sub-second precision which is employed for timing purposes throughout Octology. f8 is the module which handles .f0nt and .pal8 files for classic bitmapped easily customizable characters and very terse color palettes. m8 is not an actual module yet, but is the eventual home for Mapping and graphing functionality which can encompass arbitrary edge rel8ionships between nodes and is already the umbrella under which Markup-rel8d utilities handling XML Mixed-node reformatting and binariz8ion. U8 is a module which handles some UTF-8 character-table gener8ion, code-file Upd8ing, and U2b (YouTube) video-file downloading, name reformatting, and transcript organiz8ion.

This talk will walk new users through the myriad efficient ways that Octology commands and utilities can optimize oper8or time and key-strokes to accomplish many useful tasks intuitively, via code which can be easily and rapidly modified to suit ever more specialized cases (once the shock of how dense it all is has worn off).

The finale will be demonstr8ing 8plc which is Octology's Pre-cursor Letter Counter that processes the ~/dox/2du/8.utf file and the 1,391 8-words that are itemized within and reformul8s about 8 different ways to restructure the set of words to provide insight into interrel8ionships and correl8ions between altern8 perspectives on how such words can be constructed. This culmin8s in the 3 crosses from Calvary which came together during PassOver (just prior to Good Friday and Easter of this Year, 2020).

I gr8ly hope my talk will be illumin8ing in multiple ways, to many potential attendees.

Notes
Contact8
Please feel free to e-mail me ( Pip@CPAN.Org or PipStuart@GMail.Com ) or call (920)636-6271 if you would like to discuss any portion of this talk proposal, or to clarify technical requirements that I lacked the time to compile and convey adequ8ly above.

ThankYou
I gr8ly appreC8 your willingness to consider my proposal for inclusion in The Perl Conference in the Cloud this year.

History8
Iâ€™ve given a Lightning Talk at the 2007 YAPCNA, but am rather nervous while imagining and attempting to present all that Iâ€™ve been working on recently within an entire 50-minute talk.

Interrog8ion
I am quite excited by the prospect of having a healthy Question and Answer session afterward though. I really hope my talk gets accepted and that it goes off decently well.

PrepR8ion
I will try to prepare and rehearse whatever seems most worthwhile to present within the allotted time, and hope to revitalize some of the Perl communityâ€™s earlier vigor and enthusiasm by demonstr8ing gr8 power.

Feedback About Submission: The Perl and Raku Conf on May 05, 2020 10:01 CDT

Dear Pip Stuart,

We are sorry to inform you that your talk, Octology, the ontology of 8, for a new gener8ion of Perl Hackers who coordin8 and collabor8 on brighter future comput8ion, culmin8ing in gr8r human civiliz8ion., wasnâ€™t selected for Conference in the Cloud.

We had a lot of great submissions to our CFP, including yours, and the decision making process was not easy.

Hopefully we will still you see at Conference in the Cloud.

Thank you again.

Search lyrics sites for "Pearly Whites", "casting Pearls before Swine", && "Pearl necklaces" to clip song segments together for musical references or comedy.

Audit GoZo HoodNigga, BBoyz Rhymin&&Stealin PiecesOf8, NASA Kanye Gifted, && BiaB Resurrect for 31-second segments to gather all lyrics for as well.

Audit Obsidia Cobra && Hello for 31-second clips && maybe UKF EllieGoulding Figure8 && some other final song like Rammstein Sonne to select for singing to.

Consider prototyping pr8 (Twitter-clone) which has no hard character-limit but applies auto-compaction techniques to mostly unambiguously fit in 240, 160, 80.

`cd ~/mvz/pr0/avi;mplr -vo caca -fixed-vo h*` then manually scale down text-like vid window could show && hear ASCII pr0n if I decide funny && fine 2 include;
`cd ~/muz/U2b ;g3 -k 123  ukf/El*` for Xilent's EllieGoulding remix of "Figure8". Running `g3 -v goom2k1 ...` is probably best of -V Visualizers for now;
`cd ~/muz/mp3 ;g3 -k 104 GoZo/02*` for HoodNigga chorus ending in "Kanye".
`cd ~/muz/U2b ;g3 -k 125 N.*     ` for last 31 seconds of Gifted rap to "MerryChristmas"!
#cd ~/muz/flac;g3 -k  23 Beas*/L*/01*` for ending right after "Piece-of-8"!
#cd ~/muz/flac;g3 -k 292 Boot*/B*/14*Go.flac` for just the start of "Right thurrr...". Song part at 317. "MothaFucka" part at 359. Maybe best from 349-380.
`cd ~/muz/flac;g3 -k   2 T*/Boot*` for very nice 31 of my PoopNastyPip backups probably is cooler and better aligned than even all the above.
# maybe instead of 8 complete 31sec full background music clips, let one just include 8secs of 2LiveCrew && a couple other decent "Pearl" lyrics isol8d;
`cd ~/mvz/U2b ;mp -ss  1 -endpos 31 nxt/O*Res*` for probably just the str8 first verse of Resurrect rap by BoyInABand. Maybe start at ~150 for final verse?
`cd ~/mvz/U2b ;mp -ss  1 -endpos 31     O*Bac*` for BackAgain to just barely get going.
`cd ~/mvz/U2b ;mp -ss 89 -endpos 31 vid/R*Son*` for Sonne;
# Probably just need to pick 2 more good candid8s from Obsidia or elsewhere to have good music driving each of my 8 31-second segments (&& autom8 g3 stop);
Easy to (-s $FileName)*8 for bit Size then divide that by 31 seconds && round off the fractional part to nearest integer && call `sloc -b $Baud $FileName`;

Start sketching comic of Pip at the PerlyG8s in && out of His mind && prepare to make fun of SavingTheClockTower from Lightning(Talk) in d8ok demonstr8ion;
Start drafting ending credits .ansi to sloc scroll through for final 8th 31-second segment && then attend to scripting dialog && singing during cmnd XeQtn;

Get camera recording (&& hopefully horizontally flipped somehow so it's legible); Search for good summaries of "prayer" && RevL8ion from Biblical scholars;
####
Zoom: In browser open HTTPS://Zoom.US && select "Host a Meeting" > "with video on", pick open-xdg whatever then adjust maxed audio output volume before
  picking record && giving probably full-size video intro before starting to also "Share Screen" which will then shunt vid to tiny upper-right corner;
`g3lt` is gst123 wrapper for LightningTalk with pre-timed audio playlist of gst123 on Oiki for demonstr8ion of original GnomeSTreamer basic output to press
  '?' on within remaining 19-seconds of play-time to show help-text, then spawns `g3` with LibVis monoscope on 63-secs of Figure8, 36-secs of PoopNastyPip,
  63-secs of Cobra, && 63-secs of WhyDuITry to wrap the whole sequence up real close to 4-mins 8-secs total. Might want to add some 8-secs song4 sloc cred;
