  Description_: (supporting MarkDown)
# Octology
This talk is about an unimaginably ambitious project which aims to become a rigorous ontology by which much of possible future comput8ion could be subsumed.

## DownLoad
It is presently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/pip/Octology) and [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/octology) with intention to prepare it for a [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/author/PIP) release within June of 2021 (8 years after it was essentially started).

## Instal8n
The above linked Git repositories are meant to be installed into (or copied over) almost any existing GNU/Linux `$HOME` directory (where a modern Perl 5 and a few other prerequisites could be found in the `$PATH`).

## dMonstr8
During this talk, I will be demonstr8ing many Perl scripts which generally adhere to the Unix Philosophy (attempting to do *at-least* one thing well and to be nicely interoperable).

My name is Pip (and if you think of the Python Install8ion Program, you're not alone, but might find my aversion to whitespace quite stunning and in stark contrast). I am the spots on dice, dominos, and the suits on playing cards. Octology includes code to manipul8 each of those for innumerable types of games. There's also an interactive mechanism for showing A-Star path-finding in tons of [Screeps](https://screeps.com) Real-Time-Strategy game maps. You'll be introduced to a fE8ure-rich varE8ion on the classic game of Chess called `ckm8` (which only has a couple minor bugs left to squash yet). There's a Rubik's Cube spoonerism called `qbix` which renders in Curses text-mode.

I will be starting things off by running my elabor8 alias `ti` which is an abbreV8ion for "Terminal-Initializ8ion" that popul8s my 8 virtual desktops with myriad Gnome-Terminal applic8ions (with slightly transparent backgrounds which depend on the Compiz compositing within the Unity desktop-environment, so you can see some of the content below when my terminals are overlapping each other directly). I will demonstr8 my `trmz` Zsh alias which colorfully lists dozens of other terminal applic8ions which you too can easily have at your disposal. A guiding principle of Octology is to attempt to always provide at least 2 (and 8 even better) ways to accomplish whatever task you wish to accomplish (even when it means reinventing multiple wheels, exhibiting varying levels of roundness).

Next, I will run `sumb` which SUMmarizes Octology's ~/bin/ directory with autom8d color8ion of detailed descriptions of the wide array of over 122 different utility programs. They are organized by the ~/lib/Octology/ Perl-Modules that they are most assoC8d with. a8 is the most fundamental base-level module which Autom8s the exporting of An Awesome Array of variables, d8a-structures, and functions which are used heavily throughout the rest of the system. b8 is the Base-transl8ion module which also incorpor8s many templ8 examples of useful mathematical comput8tions and serial progressions. c8 is a Complex Collection of the Command-line Cat and Cut programs as well as Curses-like SDL graphical functionality which favors tied-arrays as ways to manipul8 Columns of Colorful text in 64 (8-squared) different `.f0nt` formats. d8 is the module which gener8s and manipul8s 8-character time-stamps which exhibit sub-second precision which is employed for timing purposes throughout Octology. f8 is the module which handles `.f0nt` and `.pal8` files for classic bitmapped easily customizable characters and very terse color palettes. m8 is not an actual module yet, but is the eventual home for Mapping and graphing functionality which can encompass arbitrary edge rel8ionships between nodes and is already the umbrella under which Markup-rel8d utilities handling XML Mixed-node reformatting and binariz8ion. U8 is a module which handles some UTF-8 character-table gener8ion, code-file Upd8ing, and U2b (YouTube) video-file downloading, name reformatting, and transcript organiz8ion.

This talk will walk new users through the myriad efficient ways that Octology commands and utilities can optimize oper8or time and key-strokes to accomplish many useful tasks intuitively, via code which can be easily and rapidly modified to suit ever more specialized cases (once the shock of how dense it all is has worn off).

The finale will be demonstr8ing `8plc` which is Octology's Pre-cursor Letter Counter that processes the ~/dox/2du/8.utf file and the 1,391 8-words that are itemized within and reformul8s about 8 different ways to restructure the set of words to provide insight into interrel8ionships and correl8ions between altern8 perspectives on how such words can be constructed. This culmin8s in the 3 crosses from Calvary which came together during PassOver (just prior to Good Friday and Easter of this Year, 2020).

Elevator Pitch:
Care to learn an immense amount of Perl, GNU/Linux, Zsh, Vim, System-Administr8ion, minimal abbreV8ions, code condens8ion, diverse d8a-represent8ions, autom8d coloriz8ion, lossless conversions, math comput8ion, problem-solving, video-game development, etc. in an hour?! Then this is the talk for you!

Description
Octology
This talk is about an ambitious grandiose project which aims to become a rigorous ontology by which all future comput8ion could be subsumed. Almost everything in the known universe has already begun to be planned for l8r inclusion, according to coherent prioritiz8ion.

DownLoad
It's presently hosted on GitHub and SourceForge with intention to prepare it for a CPAN release before July of 2021 (8 years after it was essentially started).

Instal8n
The above linked Git repositories are meant to be installed into (or copied over) almost any existing GNU/Linux $HOME directory (where a modern Perl 5 and a few other prerequisites could be found in the $PATH).

dMonstr8
During this talk, I will be demonstr8ing many Perl scripts which generally adhere to the Unix Philosophy (attempting to do at-least one thing well and to be nicely interoperable).

My name is Pip (and if you think of the Python Install8ion Program, you're not alone, but might find my aversion to whitespace quite stunning and in stark contrast). I am the spots on dice, dominos, and the suits on playing cards. Octology includes code to manipul8 each of those for innumerable types of games. There's also an interactive mechanism for showing A-Star path-finding in tons of Screeps Real-Time-Strategy game maps. You'll be introduced to a fE8ure-rich varE8ion on the classic game of Chess called ckm8 (which only has a couple minor bugs left to squash yet). There's a Rubikâ€™s Cube spoonerism called qbix which renders in Curses text-mode.

I will be starting things off by running my elabor8 alias ti which is an abbreV8ion for "Terminal-Initializ8ion" that popul8s my 8 virtual desktops with myriad Gnome-Terminal applic8ions (with slightly transparent backgrounds which depend on the Compiz compositing within the Unity desktop-environment, so you can see some of the content below when my terminals are overlapping each other directly). I will demonstr8 my trmz Zsh alias which colorfully lists dozens of other terminal applic8ions which you too can easily have at your disposal. A guiding principle of Octology is to attempt to always provide at least 2 (and 8 even better) ways to accomplish whatever task you wish to accomplish (even when it means reinventing multiple wheels, exhibiting varying levels of roundness).

Next I will be showing off cJ and CJ which are d8a-processing scripts to aggreg8, summarize, and analyze CoViD-19 (where b64 19 is equal to b10 J). Hopefully these rel8ively simple scripts can provide some useful insights into infection and mortality r8s for various St8s of particular interest to users. I hope they can help (at least in some small way) to save lives and diminish suffering and stress.

Then, I will run sumb which SUMmarizes Octology's ~/bin/ directory with autom8d color8ion of detailed descriptions of the wide array of over 122 different utility programs. They are organized by the ~/lib/Octology/ Perl-Modules that they are most assoC8d with. a8 is the most fundamental base-level module which Autom8s the exporting of An Awesome Array of variables, d8a-structures, and functions which are used heavily throughout the rest of the system. b8 is the Base-transl8ion module which also incorpor8s many templ8 examples of useful mathematical comput8tions and serial progressions. c8 is a Complex Collection of the Command-line Cat and Cut programs as well as Curses-like SDL graphical functionality which favors tied-arrays as ways to manipul8 Columns of Colorful text in 64 (8-squared) different .f0nt formats. d8 is the module which gener8s and manipul8s 8-character time-stamps which exhibit sub-second precision which is employed for timing purposes throughout Octology. f8 is the module which handles .f0nt and .pal8 files for classic bitmapped easily customizable characters and very terse color palettes. m8 is not an actual module yet, but is the eventual home for Mapping and graphing functionality which can encompass arbitrary edge rel8ionships between nodes and is already the umbrella under which Markup-rel8d utilities handling XML Mixed-node reformatting and binariz8ion. U8 is a module which handles some UTF-8 character-table gener8ion, code-file Upd8ing, and U2b (YouTube) video-file downloading, name reformatting, and transcript organiz8ion.

This talk will walk new users through the myriad efficient ways that Octology commands and utilities can optimize oper8or time and key-strokes to accomplish many useful tasks intuitively, via code which can be easily and rapidly modified to suit ever more specialized cases (once the shock of how dense it all is has worn off).

The finale will be demonstr8ing 8plc which is Octology's Pre-cursor Letter Counter that processes the ~/dox/2du/8.utf file and the 1,391 8-words that are itemized within and reformul8s about 8 different ways to restructure the set of words to provide insight into interrel8ionships and correl8ions between altern8 perspectives on how such words can be constructed. This culmin8s in the 3 crosses from Calvary which came together during PassOver (just prior to Good Friday and Easter of this Year, 2020).

I gr8ly hope my talk will be illumin8ing in multiple ways, to many potential attendees.

Notes
Contact8
Please feel free to e-mail me ( Pip@CPAN.Org or PipStuart@GMail.Com ) or call (920)636-6271 if you would like to discuss any portion of this talk proposal, or to clarify technical requirements that I lacked the time to compile and convey adequ8ly above.

ThankYou
I gr8ly appreC8 your willingness to consider my proposal for inclusion in The Perl Conference in the Cloud this year.

History8
Iâ€™ve given a Lightning Talk at the 2007 YAPCNA, but am rather nervous while imagining and attempting to present all that Iâ€™ve been working on recently within an entire 50-minute talk.

Interrog8ion
I am quite excited by the prospect of having a healthy Question and Answer session afterward though. I really hope my talk gets accepted and that it goes off decently well.

PrepR8ion
I will try to prepare and rehearse whatever seems most worthwhile to present within the allotted time, and hope to revitalize some of the Perl communityâ€™s earlier vigor and enthusiasm by demonstr8ing gr8 power.

Feedback About Submission: The Perl and Raku Conf on May 05, 2020 10:01 CDT

Dear Pip Stuart,

We are sorry to inform you that your talk, Octology, the ontology of 8, for a new gener8ion of Perl Hackers who coordin8 and collabor8 on brighter future comput8ion, culmin8ing in gr8r human civiliz8ion., wasnâ€™t selected for Conference in the Cloud.

We had a lot of great submissions to our CFP, including yours, and the decision making process was not easy.

Hopefully we will still you see at Conference in the Cloud.

Thank you again.

Search lyrics sites for "Pearly Whites", "casting Pearls before Swine", && "Pearl necklaces" to clip song segments together for musical references or comedy.

Audit GoZo HoodNigga, BBoyz Rhymin&&Stealin PiecesOf8, NASA Kanye Gifted, && BiaB Resurrect for 31-second segments to gather all lyrics for as well.

Audit Obsidia Cobra && Hello for 31-second clips && maybe UKF EllieGoulding Figure8 && some other final song like Rammstein Sonne to select for singing to.

Consider prototyping pr8 (Twitter-clone) which has no hard character-limit but applies auto-compaction techniques to mostly unambiguously fit in 240, 160, 80.

`cd ~/mvz/pr0/avi;mplr -vo caca -fixed-vo h*` then manually scale down text-like vid window could show && hear ASCII pr0n if I decide funny && fine 2 include;
`cd ~/muz/U2b ;g3 -k 123  ukf/El*` for Xilent's EllieGoulding remix of "Figure8". Running `g3 -v goom2k1 ...` is probably best of -V Visualizers for now;
`cd ~/muz/mp3 ;g3 -k 104 GoZo/02*` for HoodNigga chorus ending in "Kanye".
`cd ~/muz/U2b ;g3 -k 125 N.*     ` for last 31 seconds of Gifted rap to "MerryChristmas"!
#cd ~/muz/flac;g3 -k  23 Beas*/L*/01*` for ending right after "Piece-of-8"!
#cd ~/muz/flac;g3 -k 292 Boot*/B*/14*Go.flac` for just the start of "Right thurrr...". Song part at 317. "MothaFucka" part at 359. Maybe best from 349-380.
`cd ~/muz/flac;g3 -k   2 T*/Boot*` for very nice 31 of my PoopNastyPip backups probably is cooler and better aligned than even all the above.
# maybe instead of 8 complete 31sec full background music clips, let one just include 8secs of 2LiveCrew && a couple other decent "Pearl" lyrics isol8d;
`cd ~/mvz/U2b ;mp -ss  1 -endpos 31 nxt/O*Res*` for probably just the str8 first verse of Resurrect rap by BoyInABand. Maybe start at ~150 for final verse?
`cd ~/mvz/U2b ;mp -ss  1 -endpos 31     O*Bac*` for BackAgain to just barely get going.
`cd ~/mvz/U2b ;mp -ss 89 -endpos 31 vid/R*Son*` for Sonne;
# Probably just need to pick 2 more good candid8s from Obsidia or elsewhere to have good music driving each of my 8 31-second segments (&& autom8 g3 stop);
Easy to (-s $FileName)*8 for bit Size then divide that by 31 seconds && round off the fractional part to nearest integer && call `sloc -b $Baud $FileName`;

Start sketching comic of Pip at the PerlyG8s in && out of His mind && prepare to make fun of SavingTheClockTower from Lightning(Talk) in d8ok demonstr8ion;
Start drafting ending credits .ansi to sloc scroll through for final 8th 31-second segment && then attend to scripting dialog && singing during cmnd XeQtn;

Get camera recording (&& hopefully horizontally flipped somehow so it's legible); Search for good summaries of "prayer" && RevL8ion from Biblical scholars;
####
Zoom: In browser open HTTPS://Zoom.US && select "Host a Meeting" > "with video on", pick open-xdg whatever then adjust maxed audio output volume before
  picking record && giving probably full-size video intro before starting to also "Share Screen" which will then shunt vid to tiny upper-right corner;
`g3lt` is gst123 wrapper for LightningTalk with pre-timed audio playlist of gst123 on Oiki for demonstr8ion of original GnomeSTreamer basic output to press
  '?' on within remaining 19-seconds of play-time to show help-text, then spawns `g3` with LibVis monoscope on 63-secs of Figure8, 36-secs of PoopNastyPip,
  63-secs of Cobra, && 63-secs of WhyDuITry to wrap the whole sequence up real close to 4-mins 8-secs total. Might want to add some 8-secs song4 sloc cred;

This talk is all about bolts of Lightning from the Perly-G8s in the Clouds. It is a detailed demonstr8ion of what new users will become capable of doing by...
  ... exploring all that Octology has to offer. Enjoy! # Here and above were Lightning-Talk details from Perl-Conference 2020. Below is plans 4 2021 PerlConf;

  This is a 20-minute talk about using 20 simple Colors from Perl as in Bash/Zsh scripts with terse mnemonic abbreV8d names, as well as final Zero/^ to reset.
The talk will explain the d8-bow of "ROYG CBMP" enclosed by (blacK)"K and W"(White) with lowercased versions being dark and how "S" (for eScape) gener8s them.
Then "tstc" and "tsgr" will briefly show much more than just the basic 20 plus 1(Zero) for reset, should anyone require the now rel8ively standard 256 colors,
  as well as Octology's re-mapping of Select-Graphic-Rendition text attributes which can also easily be toggled now mnemonically too. Hope all will enjoy it!;

#!# Last Year (June 2020), my Lightning-Talk was barred from inclusion on the Perl-Conference YouTube-channel web-site due to my mental-illness (BiPolar Type-1

#!#   I was informed by two Code-of-Conduct enforcers that I had used two unacceptable words in my rapid-fire (and fleetingly momentary) ending 'Talk-Credits'
#!#   section (which was entirely intended to show simply self-deprec8ing humor, to express sarcasm for levity, and to relieve some stress). I think it should
#!#   have been quite clear that most of my Talk then was a frantic product of hyper-mania. Credits weren't intended 2 directly offend anyone personally. I was
#!#   shooting for ridiculous and preposterous. I seriously hope this Year will not be a repeat of discrimin8ing against me if I do inadvertently offend again;

2 "... letters as numbers symbolically too. As programmers (or 'hackers', if you prefer?), we tend2Balready pretty comfortable with HEXadecimal where letters"
  "... 'A' through 'F' signify Ten to FifTeen. I aim to demonstr8 that extending this convention is typically quite worth doing, for mostly obvious (and also"
4 "... some subtle) reasons. This principle can apply readily to color-codes (which is the primary emphasis of this talk), as well as many other types of d8a."
   Beyond colors, letters can be thoughtfully assoC8d with many other number-ordered sets of elements, such as additional text attributes, which fonts should
   ... be applied, palettes to select existing colors from, document formatting conventions, audio recordings (like music or sound-effect files) to select for
   ... playback, graphical image files (like clip-art collections) to be displayed, United St8s names, country names, big cities, sports team names, currently
8  ... active professional players, hall-of-famers, block-buster movies, popular TV shows, lead-actors, famous bands, musicians and singers, local attractions
  "... tourists like to visit, souvenirs && trinkets, vehicle brand names, model lines for any make, champion racers, top fighters, trainers, event promoters,"
  "... video-game publishers, well-p8ronized game franchises, board games, dominos (the brick pieces from 0/0 through 9/9 pips), standard gambling and playing"
  "... card decks (with 'Ace', 'King', down through 'Two' [13 Ranks] across 'spade', 'heart', 'diamond', and 'club' [4 suits]), beloved comic books, liter8ure"
12"... authors, best-selling novels, politicians, philosophers, scientists, Nobel-Prize winners, artists, Chemistry Elements of the Periodic Table, world-wide"
   ... actively spoken languages, dialects, famous quot8ions (usually thought past 'wisdom'), fables, myths, archetypes, arch-villains, super-heroes, deities,
   ... demi-gods, religions, creeds, rituals, traditions, holidays, birthdays, rel8ives, friends, human races, animal species, phyla (for groups of languages,
   ... animals, and plants), endangered species, extinctions, dinosaurs, types of modern birds, varieties of flowers, insect families, reptiles, fish, sharks,
16 ... whales, octopi (8-armed [&& 8-brained?!] cephalopods), bacterial strains, viruses, vaccines, deepest ocean trenches, tallest mountains, widest canyons,
  "... active volcanoes, earthquake fault-lines, constL8ions, named galaxies, habitable planetoids, asteroids, meteorites, satellites, standardized units for"
  "... measurement, pornography genres/fetishes, porn-stars, tentacle-hentai, love-motels, samurai, spartans, caesars, dict8ors, decor8d generals, prodigies,"
  "... commemor8ive monuments, public sculptures, high-powered telescopes, particle-acceler8ors, nuclear power-plants, nuclear warhead-missle-silos, newcular"
20"... Ms.PronunC8ion, universities, mascots, sk8board companies, surfboard manufacturers, olympic-medal-winning athletes, Guinness-Book world-record-holders,"
LKA... champions, serial-killers, breakfast cereals, genocides, famous assassin8ions, conspiracy theories, superstitions, best Darwin-Awards, expert surgeons;
#!#... wealthiest people, oldest people alive, gr8st cartoons, best music videos, classical symphony compositions, hardest puzzles, longest Chess matches, Go!;
#!# Are you getting the significance of this big idea yet?  Please say: "Yes."  Pretty please, with cream and semen on top?  ;)  Letters abbreV8 names better!;
  If you have a problem with the usage of letters to signify numbers, why not gripe and whine to the N8ional FootBall ("U.S.PigSkin", not WorldSoccer) League4
2   their "SuperBowl MCXXVIII" whatever? You might also want to waggle your pitchfork at the Jews for Gem8ria that uses Hebrew (or Aramaic?) to represent most
    letters as context-sensitive number values too (which are organized foolishly in Base-Ten[Base-10Decimal] not8ion, quite similarly 2 Roman-Numerals above);
4 "Prior 2 those 2 very similar Decimal systems was probably the rather familiar 4 vertical stripes, grouped together by a 5th diagonal slash (up-rt 2 dn-lt)";
  "Arabic numerals && Decimal not8ions should B phased-out diligently && promptly, since n8ure adheres far more consistently2 Base-2(Binary) or Base-8(Octal)";
6  #Decimal not8ion achieves approxim8ly 3.25-bits per character in d8a-density. If you were to switch over to my (Pip's) Octology::b8 (Base-64), 6-bits/char;
  "While I can agree that United-St8sian English typically relies upon the distinction of the 0-9 (Zero-to-Nine) digits, the fact that we can also spell them"
8 "... (and our other numbers in between, like 'One', 'Two', ... 'Seven', 'Eight') out should also provide some justific8ion for recognizing Letters2BNumbers;"
  Furthermore, if you notice in BlAcKJAcK, the Playing-Cards represent any 'Ace' as both 'One' *and* 'Eleven' (1 && 11) while any 'JAcK' counted is worth only
10 ... 'Ten' (10 conventionally, as are the other 'Face'-Cards: any 'Queen' and any 'King'). Hopefully it's clear in BJ:"K", "Q", "J" all indic8 valU of "Ten";
BJ #P.S. If you count up and add the number of letters in 'spade' + 'heart' and 'diamond' + 'club', you also arrive @BJ: JAcK = Ten and Ace = Eleven for "21"!;

  .zshrc BJ exports had problem with "\e" instead of literal "" eScape chr(27) back on L13 && now L63 it works again, but Docker had $HHst problem recently.
  I guess I want to find any non-alpha characters that can be in both Zsh && Bash variable names && hopefully also in unSKpd paramz to a8.pm S to gener8 same.

  $K && $W && $Z are set again just before PS1 prompt so probably just scrap those. Also, $HpPF profile-Picker Flag auto-loads from Perl, right after exports.
