FACM1gaH:When Ryu had boot problemz I had to `sudo vim /etc/default/grub` to have GRUB_DEFAULT=saved && GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true then `update-grub` then hold
 Shift after BIOS to pick working older version to be saved.
FACM1jHh:For autom8ng a new setup `dpkg --get-selections|grep -v deinstall` lists dependenciez along with explicitly installed packagez,
 /var/lib/apt/extended_states lacks (fig|toi)let which I know I installed manually, Checkout blueprint,
  (zc $(ls -tr /var/log/apt/history.log*.gz);cat /var/log/apt/history.log)|eg '^(Start-Date:|Commandline:)'|eg -v 'aptdaemon|autoremove|upgrade'|eg -B1 '^Commandline:'|eg -v '^--$'

  Above method is gr8 but on Aku it lacks oldest installs of zsh,vim,most,p47,etc.; aptitude search (-F '%p')? '~i!~M' might work if I eventually agi aptitude.
  Another more recent way might be to ` grep " install " /var/log/dpkg.log     ` for the current  log ,
                                      ` grep " install " /var/log/dpkg.log.1   ` for the previous log ,
                                  and `zgrep " install " /var/log/dpkg.log.2.gz` for archived     logs:

FACM72HY:Probably gnome-tweak-tool will enable Taki's && Ken's CapsLock to behave as familiar Control keys;
FACMBu0s:To get alpha transparency like Compiz in Unity in Gnome in Ubuntu 11.10 (or maybe 15.04?), but in fallback Gnome Classic, try:
`gconftool-2 --set --type=bool /apps/metacity/general/compositing_manager true && gconftool-2 --set --type=bool /apps/metacity/general/compositor_effects true`
 â€“ ploum Feb 14 '12 at 10:13 from HTTP://SuperUser.Com/questions/388315/make-gnome-terminal-real-transparent/388329#388329 . Doesn't work for me because both
 Ryu && Ken run NVidia with inadequ8 3D acceler8ion for Compiz to keep transparent gnome-terminal backgroundz (even though Ryu had them before && should);
FBCLCLCL:To`pmei Term::ReadKey`onKen as root, had2`touch /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.20/CORE/fakethr.h
                                                   touch /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.20/CORE/perlsfio.h`thN`pmei IO::Tty`&&Expect;
FCEL8KYI:It seemz /var/log/apt/history.log* is the best source for recent agi actionz but only goes back about a year. =( If I wrap the agi alias, it should
 just keep logging everything to /root/.log/agi.log && maybe if I rebuild Aku before then I can log manually all I need to setup comfortably. Might be good to
 also reconfigure logrot8 to stop removing any oldest /var/log/*.log.*.gz since the disk space is generally only scarce on my /boot partition;
FCFLAthX:According to HTTP://SuperUser.Com/questions/339863/why-doesnt-broadcast-ping-work to enable pingb `sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=0` or
 append without /^sysctl / to /etc/sysctl.conf;
G5VME0wr:Today I upgraded Ken && Chun to Ubuntu 16.04LTS && d8ok term failed right away so I needed to touch fakethr && perlsfio again for new perl/5.22 then
 pmei l8st 1.34 version of Curses. Then d8ok spit new "Negative repeat count does nothing on line 1261 of Simp.pm" warnings referring to the x oper8or until I
 tested to avoid negatives. I did agi ttf-mscorefonts-installer to give them access to Andale Mono && Courier New like Aku already had. My Ckm8 terms did use
 (Liberation Mono Regular 8), Othr used (Andale Mono Regular 8) or (DejaVu Sans Mono Book 8), && Test used (Courier 10 Pitch Regular 8) or New. Terms on Ken
 with any above font seem to all render at the same pixel sizes they have always had but Chun terms got notably wider && shorter. Only Test with (Courier 10
 Pitch Regular 8) seemed to stay the same size as all her old terms used to be. Liberation && Andale are now shorter than DejaVu, which is shorter than 10
 Pitch. At least wider fonts are more legible. Not sure yet if there's any way to fix them all to have common pixel sizing again. Setting DejaVu to 7.5pt made
 pixel width match 10 Pitch but height remains much shorter. At least default Ckm8 positioning no longer obscures majority of d8ok. It's pretty workable now;
G61M4r58:Since Aku, Ryu, && Ken all only have 228MB sda1 /boot partitions with ext2 filesystems leaving the remainder of the 2TB drives for LVM to manage,
 there's only space for 1 or 2 old kernel versions to fallback on so I want to XtNd. HTTP://AskUbuntu.Com/questions/89710/how-do-i-free-up-more-space-in-boot
 suggests (with my minor edits) `umnt /boot;md /mnt/sda1;mnt /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1;cp -a /mnt/sda1/* /boot/;umnt /mnt/sda1;v /etc/fstab;grub-install /dev/sda`
 although some posts say LVM installs need a sepR8 /boot so maybe I could test it on Aku's external drive first. Major problem is that not just filesystems but
 partitions also need to be resized at the beginning of sda so maybe just clean-sl8ing a fresh install with manual  sda1 /boot to have at least 1GB of ext2;
G61M86oU:DistUpgraded Ryu&&Aku also. Aku said some 3rdParty NtrEz in sources.list disabled. rENAbl aftr upgrade with software-properties or package manager;
G61MAOOH:It looks like g3 requires pmfi IO::Tty; Maybe `v /etc/apt/sources.list` to s/wily/xenial/g then aguu would let `ag dist-upgrade` work for term log.
 Might be safer to agu, agi update-manager-core, do-release-upgrade instead since dist-upgrade may remove important packages due to dependency issues. The GUI
 DistUpgradeTool writes what I want anyway to /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt-term.log; G61ME026:Also mplayer is no longer installed;

Reading about setting up new Tor Browser v8, if ever needing to open mainly .doc or PDF files externally which were downloaded through Tor, they have strongly
  recommended only doing it offline l8r, downloading free HTTPS://VirtualBox.Org && using it with an HTTP://VirtualBoxes.Org VM image with networking disabled
  or by using HTTPS://Tails.Boum.Org instead. Under no circumstances is it safe to use BitTorrent && Tor together, since BT design deanonymizes && slows Tor.
If it l8r seems worthwhile to reduce risk of net traffic inspections revealing Tor usage, try configuring to use a 'bridge relay' rather than directly public.

  When I build, buy, or diagnose any system, I always try to run a set of stress tests. See if any component does well enough or if any has a risk being DOA.
  1) Memtest86. Make sure the memory is not defective.  # I would run this particular set of tests in succession:   ## Probably pretty worthwhile protocol!
  2)   Prime95. Stress   CPU, Motherboard, && Memory. (Don't forget to have something capable of reading temps like HW Monitor or AI suite). OCCT works too.
  3) Furmark  . Push the GPU to the thermal limit.      # OCCT alone is not a reliable evalU8ion. Gotta go through a full set of tests for thorough results.
  4) Assorted benchmarks. Think Unigine, 3DMark, AIDA64 && the likes.  # Note: Just because memory is approved, do *NOT* expect it to run it at full speed.
  #  I got a 3200MHz set, but even with AGESA1006 I can run it at 2966MHz tops. Quite a few have made that mistake. May be especially applicable for Ryzen. ;

K23LJACK:Thinking about Cg8FireCuda500GBSSD coming soon, rediscovered `dpkg -l|giv '^ii'|giv linux|cut -s -d' ' -f2-3|g '^ '` as way to grep list of RmvdCfgz
  but `ai appmenu-gtk-module-common apport fuse gpsd gtk3-nocsd jackd1 libc6-amd64:i386 libcxxtools9v5 libdvd-pkg libsensors-config libtirpc-common lirc lsm`
  wanted to Remove way too many clang fuse g++ gcc ladi jack && lib pkgz which seem more important to Oni than few install candid8z, so aborted the oper8ion.
  Trying just `ai appmenu-gtk-module-common apport gpsd gtk3-nocsd libdvd-pkg libsensors-config libtirpc-common lirc lsm` only wantd2 Remove systemd-coredump
  so allowed to proceed, expecting sysd-cordmp can just be agri back over its conflict afterward if it seems necessary or useful enough to try doing so 4 it.
  apport was the conflict but sd-cd provided coredumpctl cdc so I swapped them back && libdvd-pkg's attempt to get src && ag check failed so agr on that too;
