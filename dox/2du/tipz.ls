FACM1gaH:When Ryu had boot problemz I had to `sudo vim /etc/default/grub` to have GRUB_DEFAULT=saved && GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true then `update-grub` then hold
 Shift after BIOS to pick working older version to be saved.
FACM1jHh:For autom8ng a new setup `dpkg --get-selections|grep -v deinstall` lists dependenciez along with explicitly installed packagez,
 /var/lib/apt/extended_states lacks (fig|toi)let which I know I installed manually, Checkout blueprint,
  (zc $(ls -tr /var/log/apt/history.log*.gz);cat /var/log/apt/history.log)|eg '^(Start-Date:|Commandline:)'|eg -v 'aptdaemon|autoremove|upgrade'|eg -B1 '^Commandline:'|eg -v '^--$'
  # study above cmdz. Eventually shud rEprocS output2just hv d8:`ag[ir] pkgz` cmdz with matching acs Dscriptz folo as comNtz && rEmMbr `uname -a` 4krnl version
  Above method is gr8 but on Aku it lacks oldest installs of zsh,vim,most,p47,etc.; aptitude search (-F '%p')? '~i!~M' might work if I eventually agi aptitude.
  Another more recent way might be to ` grep " install " /var/log/dpkg.log     ` for the current  log ,
                                      ` grep " install " /var/log/dpkg.log.1   ` for the previous log ,
                                  and `zgrep " install " /var/log/dpkg.log.2.gz` for archived     logs:
FACM1rwi:Studying grub submenu spec might let me gener8 better filterz for /boot/grub/grub.cfg =~ /^\s*menuentry/ to match which optionz matter;
FACM72HY:Probably gnome-tweak-tool will enable Taki's && Ken's CapsLock to behave as familiar Control keys;
FACMBu0s:To get alpha transparency like Compiz in Unity in Gnome in Ubuntu 11.10 (or maybe 15.04?), but in fallback Gnome Classic, try:
`gconftool-2 --set --type=bool /apps/metacity/general/compositing_manager true && gconftool-2 --set --type=bool /apps/metacity/general/compositor_effects true`
 â€“ ploum Feb 14 '12 at 10:13 from HTTP://SuperUser.Com/questions/388315/make-gnome-terminal-real-transparent/388329#388329 . Doesn't work for me because both
 Ryu && Ken run NVidia with inadequ8 3D acceler8ion for Compiz to keep transparent gnome-terminal backgroundz (even though Ryu had them before && should);
FBCLCLCL:To`pmei Term::ReadKey`onKen as root, had2`touch /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.20/CORE/fakethr.h
                                                   touch /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.20/CORE/perlsfio.h`thN`pmei IO::Tty`&&Expect;
FCEL8KYI:It seemz /var/log/apt/history.log* is the best source for recent agi actionz but only goes back about a year. =( If I wrap the agi alias, it should
 just keep logging everything to /root/.log/agi.log && maybe if I rebuild Aku before then I can log manually all I need to setup comfortably. Might be good to
 also reconfigure logrot8 to stop removing any oldest /var/log/*.log.*.gz since the disk space is generally only scarce on my /boot partition;
FCFLAthX:According to HTTP://SuperUser.Com/questions/339863/why-doesnt-broadcast-ping-work to enable pingb `sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=0` or
 append without /^sysctl / to /etc/sysctl.conf;
G5VME0wr:Today I upgraded Ken && Chun to Ubuntu 16.04LTS && d8ok term failed right away so I needed to touch fakethr && perlsfio again for new perl/5.22 then
 pmei l8st 1.34 version of Curses. Then d8ok spit new "Negative repeat count does nothing on line 1261 of Simp.pm" warnings referring to the x oper8or until I
 tested to avoid negatives. I did agi ttf-mscorefonts-installer to give them access to Andale Mono && Courier New like Aku already had. My Ckm8 terms did use
 (Liberation Mono Regular 8), Othr used (Andale Mono Regular 8) or (DejaVu Sans Mono Book 8), && Test used (Courier 10 Pitch Regular 8) or New. Terms on Ken
 with any above font seem to all render at the same pixel sizes they have always had but Chun terms got notably wider && shorter. Only Test with (Courier 10
 Pitch Regular 8) seemed to stay the same size as all her old terms used to be. Liberation && Andale are now shorter than DejaVu, which is shorter than 10
 Pitch. At least wider fonts are more legible. Not sure yet if there's any way to fix them all to have common pixel sizing again. Setting DejaVu to 7.5pt made
 pixel width match 10 Pitch but height remains much shorter. At least default Ckm8 positioning no longer obscures majority of d8ok. It's pretty workable now;
G61M4r58:Since Aku, Ryu, && Ken all only have 228MB sda1 /boot partitions with ext2 filesystems leaving the remainder of the 2TB drives for LVM to manage,
 there's only space for 1 or 2 old kernel versions to fallback on so I want to XtNd. HTTP://AskUbuntu.Com/questions/89710/how-do-i-free-up-more-space-in-boot
 suggests (with my minor edits) `umnt /boot;md /mnt/sda1;mnt /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1;cp -a /mnt/sda1/* /boot/;umnt /mnt/sda1;v /etc/fstab;grub-install /dev/sda`
 although some posts say LVM installs need a sepR8 /boot so maybe I could test it on Aku's external drive first. Major problem is that not just filesystems but
 partitions also need to be resized at the beginning of sda so maybe just clean-sl8ing a fresh install with manual  sda1 /boot to have at least 1GB of ext2;
G61M86oU:DistUpgraded Ryu&&Aku also. Aku said some 3rdParty NtrEz in sources.list disabled. rENAbl aftr upgrade with software-properties or package manager;
G61MAOOH:It looks like g3 requires pmfi IO::Tty; Maybe `v /etc/apt/sources.list` to s/wily/xenial/g then aguu would let `ag dist-upgrade` work for term log.
 Might be safer to agu, agi update-manager-core, do-release-upgrade instead since dist-upgrade may remove important packages due to dependency issues. The GUI
 DistUpgradeTool writes what I want anyway to /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt-term.log; G61ME026:Also mplayer is no longer installed;

HTTPS://AskUbuntu.Com/questions/966799/ubuntu-17-10-keyboard-not-working-after-login-following-upgrade-from-17-04-gnom suggests `agr fwupd` may fix problem.

maybe `ag --purge autoremove xserver-xorg-input-all && agi xserver-xorg-input-all` then rebooting may be another avenue for resolving whatever the issue is.
