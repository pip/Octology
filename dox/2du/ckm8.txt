So maybe 4 2-week (except the last is 3-weeks wrapping my birthday DCD && Christmas DCP) milestones on Mondays: DBB,DBP,DC9,DCU
DBB:define pieces, movement, && string forms of board d8a encapsul8d in a module
DBP:render rot8able colored detail in at least pseudo 160x50 text mode && add interface features of move history with d8 timings (&& 240x67, 80x25, 8x8?)
DC9:incorpor8 best free Chess d8abase I can find or hack my own to track play history && provide navig8ion through online records
DCU:detect moving into check && checkmate conditions && polish interface for input from keyboard, mouse (Chun touch?), or joystick
DAUMGepL: Unicode pieces:

I'm still unsure about string form of board. Maybe compact form of  32 characters design8ing b64 coordin8 for RIBKQSTOPAWNCDEFpawncdefribkqsto where captured
pieces specify their loc8ion as the same as the opponent King. Then 64 character expanded form placing the above letters in position with 0 or 1 used for
unoccupied White or blacK squares respectively. The uniform length of these formats seems advantageous for comparison but l8-game FEN is more compact.
Utilities to convert between 32 position, FEN, PGN, && full board 64 will be needed. I'm not sure where axes && indexed ordering should go yet though.
Upper-left 0 has seemed best so far but puts White on top disturbingly. Rot8ing or inverting seems so desirable that maybe one of those should become default.
                                                                                                              K6k/8/8/8/8/8/8/8 might be shortest FEN.
Slashes in FEN are extraneous and dash could be used to design8 no more pieces or alt captured in 32pos form: K6k-
Roundtripping through FEN will lose track of which pawns are which and RIB vs. STO and may just have to alloc8 them in order. CCN8:Ckm8 Coordin8 Not8ion?
Another format could list pieces and positions assuming King and king as first two starting as 62 characters which dwindle by pairs as captures are made.
3xQ4 is an endgame example with kings remaining in their starting positions and the only other piece is the White Queen still on her starting square too.
Need to append fields for next turn, castling, en passant potential, half-move clock since last capture or pawn advance for 50-move draw, full-move number,
optional encoded rot8ion, history format, and then move history. 0101010110101010010101011010101001010101101010100101010110101010-NCCCCEDMMRFHHHHHHHHHHHH...
ckm8 main differences from traditional Chess programs:           01010101/10101010/01010101/10101010/01010101/10101010/01010101/10101010-NCCCCEDMMRFHH...
  0) White defaults to up top; 1) piece N means pawN instead of kNight; 2) "moves" are synonymous with 0-based plys rather than 1-based with half-moves;
History format default includes d8 stamps then reversible piece-position pairs for source and destin8ion squares which should be able to be followed all the
way back to a game's starting conditions and valid8 NCCCCEDMM. Any of my 3 board string formats (64b, 32p, && ppl) for (full 64 Board, 32 Positions, and
Piece-Position List) should termin8 with a dash where 32p and ppl with 15 pieces captured will be the same length and should be discernible as ppl if and only
if all even positions from 2 on only include valid piece name abbreV8ions. If using a dash (instead of opponent king position) for captured pieces in 32p turns
out to unacceptably complic8 things then another character should be selected or such an altern8ive captured design8ion option should just be removed entirely.
32p and ppl board represent8ion options are for brevity and slightly easier human construction but are inessential and should be back-burner to mainstay 64b.
Maybe RF rot8ion and history format options should precede NCCCCEDMM since any full history makes them unnecessary so they should be optional too.
Interface should present history with separ8 dur8ions between d8 stamps on moves. N =~ /^[Wk]$/. CCCC should get dashes for no longer available castling.
E should be - when en passant is unavailable or the position when it is (and maybe that only when an opposing pawn is in position to potentially perform it?).
D should be b64 plys toward 50-move draw. MM is b64 moves (plys) with 4096 as an abundant maximum (269*2 record). R and F will probably be b64 characters that
encode bits for board or pieces rot8ion and trailing history format options. 64b could like FEN allow any slashes and maybe digits other than 01 for blanks.
Distinctly coloring at least the backgrounds of rows differently might help readability without needing slashes.
DB6LBdXM:Now thinking appending history to single string form of board and d8a just gets too unwieldy quickly with d8 stamps so throw RF back to the end and
have similar blocks of separ8 lines starting from /^(hist|futr):/; Redefinition of "move" to 0-based plys renders N for next turn obvious so should be omitted.
So maybe RF should still come first in case full following history section describes CCCCEDMM allowing it to be omitted and gener8d.
ppl should accept arbitrary order past Kk and persist when selected as driving represent8ion but otherwise presented as RIBQSTOPAWNCDEFpawncdefribqsto.
ckm8 main innov8ions: 0) every piece has become unique, named (with expected gender), and abbreV8d because distinguishing pieces of common type adds variety;
1) every square has become positionally identifiable by a single b64 character; 2) d8 timed events and navig8ion; 3) making Chess colorful at least by type;
