H77MJYkw: Got nice Sony SXRD 50-Inch 1080i KDS-R50XBR1 TV with RCA RCRN04GZ R25947 4T25CX remote from Amanda. Maybe when Aku dies buy parts to fix && new snd
  && vids for Ryu && Ken, SlimBlade, USB, and parts for a whole new Oni box with AMD Ryzen && 2 32" monitors? Save at least $1500 for new LifeBook if needed?

H2PLCxJK: NewEgg has 2015 Samsung UN40J6200AFXZA 40-Inch 1080p HD Smart LED TV which seems pretty nice for $400. 1ms 32" monitors for little more have DVI in.

  maybe add a few of the better video cables to go with new displays && maybe rebuild whole new AntecP183 Seasonic650+ machine as Uka or Dan or new Gen?

 enable both PS2 && 3 to run into audio card without having to switch optical cables, && get another SlimBlade && HHKB while you're at it?

  maybe eventually try a Roccat IskuFX or RyosMKPro keyboard that can do TalkFX together with KoneXTD to control their LEDs as signals or just to look pretty,
  although it looks like controlling LEDs for XTD requires some barely documented firmware editing, so I should probably expect to be able to live wi default;
E1NLGc4i:thankfully l8st config seems to be quite stable without EVGA or BlueGears in there anymore, so less urgent to make big ordr, but ExpertMouse wheel
 just started failing && should be remedied quickly; maybe I should be frugal, really not knowing when I might gain substantial income again, so just get:
  SlimBlade && drives && displays && speakers && all of it.. or will I need savings more l8r? Even scarce money on most of this gear should be well spent;
E1KLMoVW:just EVGA crashed too so swapped VaporX back into lower slot where EVGA had been && TV sound blipped with indic8or-multiload upd8s then crashed so
 swapped back to top slot && sound problem gone && hopefully a little stable now, or still have to w8 for drives && rolling back to 13.04 stability?
E1KLESZ0:although just yanked BlueGears && VaporX to fallback on EVGA as might be stable with video && schism in 13.10,but glitter top bar switching vdesktop;
 also Alt-Tab blank flash && zooming flickers TV,but maybe still better than crashing? perturbing versus devast8ing, unless starts crashing too;
