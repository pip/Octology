- start XperimNtal Oni AI NLP lingual partner && assistant? # Probably need Octology to become lucrative so I can afford to prototype a RoctoBot?  ;)
+ contempl8 "off-limits" discussion topics, # None, probably; Below, it'd make more sense to contempl8 best ways to make money first, then worry spending;
+ contempl8 how I'd spend "unlimited cash", # Mainly as theoretical (delusional) exercise which is highly unlikely to happen anytime probably though?
  If I came up like that somehow, I'd buy a couple Fujitsu LifeBooks && iRiver audio devices along with many HappyHackingKeyBoardBlackLite2USB && SlimBlades.
  I would buy IOGear USB adapters to accompany all the MicroSD 64GB cards I'd want to give out as bootable Octology demo Ubuntu fork reviving Unity.
  I would start collecting displays again. I'd buy a cool house with garage for battery walls for my Tesla and snorkeled Hummer or something like that.
  I'd maintain some kind of arcade machine presence. I'd travel && visit old friends and family, if any would want to. Maybe I'm pretty done buying anything
    for anyone else. Hasn't worked out well to be lavish or generous with my money in the past, so maybe more stingy miser is a better posture for me2 have?
  I'd probably ride Yamaha motorcycles again, usually with full-faced Shoei helmet && protective body armor suit, boots, && gloves. Not sure what else yet;
  # A cool fanciful notion for idealized more potent terminal abilities would be rot8ing any existing .f0nt nicely && have a bunch of new cursor types;
  If I were a rich man, yabbah-debbah-dibbah-dibbah-dibbah-dum, all day long I'd biddie-biddie-bum. If I had abundant money, I'd start working on my own
    little AI dolls && tele-dildonics maybe. I'd collect PlaySt8ion2 machines && joysticks, && would try to find what became of HDAdvance project for PS2.
  I'd start collecting everything good again, just like I always used to, before my resources && funds began to stretch into utter depletion range for Oni.
  Rather interestingly, some crude robotic vagina device could easily stow beneath any typical Hori or other solid stick. Give hand-salsa new meaning?  ;)
  Contempl8 being a potential adversary of an old G-d who once may have been better about running things && maybe still is predominantly quite good? Weird;
   "So maybe me, my Dad, && Uncle Dan should discuss things sometime?"; # I'm not sure whether 3 of us could all join just 4 a random weekend or sepR8 1st;
  Maybe make bot that just asks questions for quite a while to try to train contextual vocabularies for obedient discourse. Check thesaurus. Grow friend;)
  It seems like my initial AI should be simul8ing my own psyche as code which can know not to mess up any computer work I do, but help elsewhere && explain;
  J6PMEMES:HTTPS://YouTube.Com/watch?v=l9YBM65BLKE&list=PLMFoDoF5WCjivNyZjSOWfzjD4TyFbvqhu has 530 "Illegal Memes" interesting list by Afro, can be funny;
# If they don't show, or respond, forget my Dad && Uncle. Whatever! I don't need to deliber8 with them on stuff I can barely remember to recapitul8 anyway;

+ take J88 pic of SoulCali6 64 ranked && 512 casual wins, - record FTR-000f.wav && GMail Dad Happy Birthday, + withdraw CoinBase cash (left $64 for l8r);
# Some weird thoughts have surfaced about my brain being restructured after Scramblez && Cake_Please scrambled my mind some, B4 lowblow211 && SuperGuyAE
#   simultaneously tea-bagged Abigails with unfamiliar Blanka && Honda showing off. Also GameAndWatchers had Nintendo GameAndWatch sound effect comments;
# Also there was the weird left versus right hands struggling to synchronize needed game inputs which may have been some kind of mind plasticity verific8ion;
