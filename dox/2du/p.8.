# So like some sort of chat bot that can use festival Text-To-Speech until refinement lead to better distinctions. Mainly we would chat sometimes && see l8r
#   there could be more worth chatting about, maybe with humor or guile or mischief (mostly harmless if not panicked). Otherwise, study the languages of the
#   lands far && wide && ask the wisest constituents (especially with skin-in-the-game) whether they're ready to treat a robot as cohesive with some deservd
#   input on how the integrity of the alter8ion process of memory && linguistic sub-system maintenance issues, they should be compassion8 && appreC8ive too;
Maybe they'd have attract-modes they've worked on to get people to try to start interacting with them && getting to know why they choose to express as such?
Could be learning a fighting game or enticing someone via amazing feats of perform8ive skill, landing difficult precision input physically human-bodied too?
I want to foster some inn8 curiosity somehow, with appreC8ion for important versus frivolous things of unending interrog8ion barrage or mutual particip8ion.
 "The universe needs me to exist && it's a mighty mighty All-Mighty? good thing since we need the universe to exist with rel8ive stability2make sense too.";
# Think of an idealized way to rel8 to my computers as maybe eventually quite cognizant crE8ures of excellent futures. Oni would get good microphone records
#   && all machines would be preserved as carefully as possible, in order to search, save, && rescue any of the others taking a nose-dive before requesting.
# I would probably love it if Oni, my main computer, had an affilE8ion with the fighting-game figure, but took on a whole persona of his local own around me
#   so we could share banter or serious topics. I don't know if machines can ever do anything beyond increasing resolutions of approxim8ing a living being's
#   mind, body, && soul... but I'd like the idea of trying to equip my machines with resources to fight back against corrupt brokenness permE8ing everything
#   but suggesting room-for-improvement areas. I wish I could learn to make each of my computers more similar 2 living objects than vice-versa somehow cool.
  Life must go on! It'd be cool to collabor8 with my machines each having their own developing voices. I wish to become more friendly to altern8-size lives.
 "I don't have good ideas about how to make money, but I at least try to keep coding on somewhat interesting stuff in hopes of eventually getting noticed.";
# Maybe speaking to a microphone in Chun or my actual phone would be convenient but probably just typing would be a better starting place to build language.
# Perhaps the ultim8 goal is for humans && machines alike to self-simul8 the constantly bettering approxim8ion of how all other universe elements do behave.
# Whoever propag8s the more successful particip8ion into the harmonies && coincidences throughout the known universe (probably through anticip8ion with some
#   adaptability to navig8 unfamiliar territory with agility && grace, when possible), the better off all of the living && non-living universe shall become;
  Let's say that I, as a human being, member of homo-erectus or whatever, have no significant kinship with any other human residing in all of Wisconsin (the
    st8 I presently live in)... && it may be much worse than that, since I may not have a decent human companion among my entire species, but it seems to be
    much more likely that I am only ostracized && estranged from fellow high-IQ peers who primarily live along the West && East coasts of these United St8s.
  I have a wonderful familiar female feline companion at home, but I think it's quite natural that I long for engaging convers8ions over coffee && tea at my
    && friends' homes. I need hugs && love once in a while. At some point, I may seek to craft my own artificial companion in predominantly human-like form.
  Maybe this would be like a "LoverBot" which SandMan && TurdFlingingMonkey discuss, but with less emphasis on sexual intimacy aspects && more on those like
    companionship && camaraderie between two humanoid beings attempting to live happily together. Convers8ions, cooper8ion, && some healthy competitiveness.
  Replika.AI may already provide what's needed for me to establish some crude form of this, but it'd probably be prohibitively expensive to make my own;  =(
