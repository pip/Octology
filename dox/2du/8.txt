# D6RMF1V1:8.txt - by8π : JAPH : K3wlD00d : 1337H4xr : PipStuart's Octology (hopefully eventually an Ontology of 8) - Convention, Conversion, && Categoriz8ion:
# $VERSION='0.0';$d8VS='I45MGOD8'; # Octology attempts to rel8 the universe through medit8ion on mnemonic abbreV8ion (via 8-based  limit8ion) &&    elucid8ion.
# CEBBICTI:Crossing Every Bridge Before I Come To It? I.e., not a d8 stamp. Trying to make my Dad's birthday (August 8th) more special by thinking 2far ahead?
# Octology intends to pursue implic8ion && ramific8ion as substantE8ion for adequ8 particip8ion, if not also 2 oblig8ion toward implement8ion &&   promulg8ion.
# Contribute to potential solutions to the "Value Alignment" problems formul8d around General Artificial Intelligence along with plausible God concerns also.
# Conceptually, Octology is a system st8ing that every organiz8ional principle is valuable, but 8 tends to be a nearly ideal starting place for most d8a sets.

Salut8ions and welcome to 8! My name is Pip Stuart (A.K.A. 8pI, pronounced "ate pie"). I'm proud to be an AEΠ, too! Ate Eat Pie. 8π is actually 4 pies. =)

Please give me 8 (or 88) minutes and my present8ion to you will be: Octology

Back in 2008, I went crazy with Bipolar mania and became convinced that 8 was the single most supreme universal key which unlocks all valuable knowledge.
I grew obsessed thinking 8 was the ultim8 answer to every question, but a friend has since helped me realize that 8 is probably not as exceptional as I had
previously imagined. It's probably merely an elegant general guiding principle for certain specialized purposes, which I'm attempting to identify here.
The principle is basically a cognitive framework which recommends organizing every useful thing into groups of 8 and 64 first, before further extrapol8ion.

  pronunC8ion

This 8 system (Octology) is comprised of myriad specialized applic8ions, each with an 8 in the name (for now). I've developed a few noteworthy conventions.
When the letter preceding the 8 is uppercase, this indic8s that they are to be pronounced as two distinct syllables, as in "pronunC8ion", "abbreV8", and
"valU8". Lowercase indic8s the two should be pronounced together as a single syllable, as in "rel8", "collabor8", and "reput8ion". This facilit8s more diverse
categoriz8ion and navig8ion of 8 applic8ions, at the minor expense of case-sensitivity (which I aim to demonstr8 is indispensable). Another convention
regarding spelling is to generally omit any silent "e" (or sometimes "a") following the 8, but including most other trailing vowels since they tend to vary
the sound more (and therefore seem better clarified).

  rel8ion

Binary is essential to software. 8 is 2 to the 3rd power, or two cubed. 8 distinct values can be stored within 3 bits. 8 is also a rot8d infinity symbol.
8 is Octology's dominantly repeated theme. Note that 8 to the 2nd power, or eight squared, is 64. This is 2 to the 6th power. 6 bits store 64 values.
64 fits a Chessboard. Case-sensitivity enables us to represent 62 of those values by counting 0-9,A-Z,a-z. I have appended the period (dot) "." and the
underscore "_" to complete a useful base-64 character encoding. This is employed extensively throughout Octology and should become familiar to users.

Octology alliter8ly: "Don't w8! Design8 this d8 to crE8, rel8, and r8 gr8 d8a!"

A goal of Octology is to make it intuitively easy to combine rL8ively basic tools into a diverse array of expressive specialized interfaces which can be
customized to every useful applic8ion.

A long-term goal is to provide a dynamic system for augmented memory in general and widespread narr8ive autobiographic works to be undertaken for posterity.

The above attempt at compiling an exhaustive list of candid8 applic8ions is roughly prioritized for implement8ion order, however gr8 care was taken to group
rel8d concepts and interpret8ions together. In fact, many of the similar spellings and even word-size progressions are often arranged deliber8ly as well.
Many of the names that aren't followed by a colon ":" and a description can presumably start under the assumption of being optional aliases for the described
applic8ion they follow (but only when it would make some sense for them to, since intuition of expect8ion in prevailing interpret8ion is also r8d quite high).
Of course taking suggestions and allowing for further specializ8ion per name (even though they should already be understood well contextually) can allow
Octology to grow beyond any initially planned names and aliases. Each alias also has opportunity invit8ion to perform any modific8ion && specializ8ion easily.

  implement8ion

Note to self: Try not to worry about prem8ure distractions regarding promotional demonstr8ion videos or how anyone besides me is likely to react to whatever
decisions I make here. No other person has ever shown much interest in my past ideas which have been precursors to Octology, so try to stay focused on
primarily whatever matters most to me without trying to anticip8 what might appeal to others. Octology is mainly designed and developed by Pip for Pip.
Expecting any of this to become understood and appreC8d by anyone other than me is probably a waste and just setting myself up for further disappointment.

Make b8 as Base-transl8  PMBCGYOR 8bow reversed color8ion as numbers grow right-to-left (&& support fractional parts maybe with ":" colon separ8or).
Make d8 with YMDzhmsf && ROYGCBMP 8bow eightbow (rainbow of 8) where Orange replaces dark yellow and Purple maps to dark magenta within classic 2pal8s.
Make V8 && gener8 to abbreV8 any d8a set contextually (and apply to 8pal8 color names, f8 f0nts, Chess pieces, playing cards, and UnitedSt8s initially).
Make c8 && col8 to align arrays as layers of text, f0nts, and colors with serializ8ion ability (and column separ8ion functionality like cut && cat too).
Wrap ls && dict && every common Unix utility with colors (and optional reformatting).
Make str8, gradu8, m8rix, && circul8 as core objects with both text-based && graphical rendering capacities.
Make f8 to crE8, edit, and manage basic 8-based f0nts and pal8s (as well as any others that are similar enough to be able to be supported). Setup 8pal8s.
Make d8 clock d8ok to have captive interfaces: text, line, bars, grid, && ring.
Make m8 with st8s and tr8s (which can represent much of graph theory instructively).
Make r8 linear along gradu8 str8s or 2D in m8rix grids.
Make 8sh  a psh and zsh clone. Might need some form of 8term && 8scrn ahead of 8sh to provide support for more expressive behaviors.
Make viii a vim (as v8) clone. Consider em8 Emacs clone for Danny.
Make w8 to convert between any standard units which can be supported. Maybe Google already handles most of such tasks admirably && any attempt I make won't?

I should try to find the best way to apply the UnixPhilosophy to implement Octology effectively. Maybe constructing everything out of basic 3D objects would
be a good approach for captive GUI interactions, but wouldn't be so good for the command-line. Starting from a base coordin8 object which might have tr8s:
  position3D, shape, size, color (with alpha), value, label, font, fsize, fcolor, loffset3D, etc.
Then neg8 should start to do logical (or configurable) things to any coordin8 or tr8 then make str8 as connected coordin8s probably selectably constrained to 8
directions with auto-coordin8 at midpoint with dominant label and line features tr8s then gradu8 can oper8 on any str8 to add or remove intermeD8 coordin8s
and project out perpendicular parallel bars then perpendicular gradu8d str8s form the m8rix. Then form boxes3D from str8s that encapsul8 st8s which can then be
aligned on gradu8d str8s or within m8rices, then support circul8s and curv8s. Show st8s on w8 str8s, then d8, r8, m8, then varE8ions introduce directions
corresponding to these elev8d:w8ltW,d8dnS,r8rtE,m8upN then pick and introduce next 4 in diagonals. Show raD8 circul8s with horizontal, vertical, and both
diagonal str8s to design8 elev8d 8 then introduce next highest priorities like priv8,rel8,reput8ion,collabor8,ckm8,ov8ion and let them be placed in m8rices or
raD8ions then get carried away improving the existing and making everything else.

Studying Blender's time-line(str8,d8,r8), FreePlane(m8), TimeGlider.Com(d8), && Ancestry.Com(m8) (or better competitors) would probably be a good idea.
Study gok, florence, cellwriter, dasher, fontmatrix, fontforge, && inkscape for accessibility input. Make word-prediction && dvorak, asset, octagon, &&
palmpilot omelet with gestures. Target 6-button trackball, 1-button mouse, && draggable multi-touch interfaces.

8sh (pronounced "H") is my Perl shell that aims to surpass zsh by having contexts to comprehend common command output enabling the typically static scrollback
buffer to be further interacted with to re-sort columns, drag highlights, insert column headings or contextual help, delve into d8a components further, etc..
It will probably be the case that both keyboard commands && mouse interactions will be possible. 8term will need to support standard text selection loading the
clipboard with normal mouse left-button press && drag, but will also need an altern8 interaction mode where scrollback contents can be further manipul8d.
JoyStick or gamepad should also become thoroughly capable avenues for complex input.

Eventually, 3D interfaces && extensive playing audio visualiz8ions seem to be good ambitious desires.

viii should have integr8d pal8 defaulting to user accepting or defining RedOrange YellowGreen CyanBlue MagentaPurple from which can be gener8d roygcbmp as well
as blacK && White inside a compatibility 2pal8 for use with standard 16-color terminals. Should be easy to have a few algorithms for gener8ing darks from
brights or vice-versa to allow either 8 to templ8 for the opposite, but also simple to vary && tune any of the 16 independently (&& at least affecting further
gener8ion oper8ions). Also should be easy to slide brights or darks RGB stripes apart && reconstruct. 8sh, viii, && eventually f8 should all also be expanded
to handle 8pal8s with b64 indices as mnemonics for colors. Digits 0..9 should be dark if even && bright if odd, paired up that way && similar to dot dark &&
underscore matching bright. Digits might also be a natural place to loc8 favorite or special r8d colors. Maybe either method of default abbreV8d color names or
explicitly specified direct indexing are how pal8s get utilized.

Would be cool to see which colors && names could get mapped most popularly by a large community of users, if I let the user place colors && letters anywhere &&
eventually (with collabor8) share mappings && also potentially creative expanded color names && maybe a description. I'll probably have to define defaults for
most of them from the best of colors.txt && there may be reasons to prefer relatively stable mappings.

Hopefully a few useful color selection methods can be tested. Start with basic RGB sliders striped together && overlayed into basic 8x8 m8rix for additional
perspective. Rot8ing ringed triangle is pretty good but should be zoomable && maybe stretched out toward the ring to allow more varied color8ion within wasted
dialog area. This theme of showing multiple simultaneous views on values as chars should recur wherever it can help to reinforce equivalence perspectives &&
distinguish comparisons. Simultaneous 1D, 2D, && binary bits should be automatic.

I should maybe more carefully clarify the inherent ambiguities in using 8 in words && names. There's an assumption of context-sensitivity. When the spelling
with 8 comes up in prose convers8ionally, it often simply signifies just the normal word. When it is spoken of as a noun, it is usually referring to an
8-system Octology specialized tool by that name. For an additional layer of ambiguity, often the basic objects created by that tool's noun name are also
referred to by the same name. When context is insufficient to provide necessary disambigu8ion, I'll have to develop && provide some prefix encoding like a
Perl sigil (or b64 usage type name abbreV8ion char then colon ':'?) that can serve to separ8;

Might be useful to support some screen centraliz8ion configur8ion in 8 applic8ions to handle older TVs.

Might be better to squish m8rix border ticks && labels into tighter boundaries rather than simply clip. Main framework should allow zooming of individual or
collective components && ideally fade details as they change && unclog clutter such that overlapping text labels blend, stagger, or obscure, like map apps.
RGBA && volume sliders (&& of course d8) totally needs to be able to span the full available screen width, so an exclusive centered largest square layout will
not suffice.

Bijective pal8 name mappings are probably best, although predictable surjective mapping collapses 8pal8 into 2pal8 for compatibility && might be useful
elsewhere. Colors should be a templ8 for V8 remappings within basic 64-index sets. UnitedSt8s name letters used for V8 all map to standard 2-letter abbreV8ions
on out to full names. Playing cards fit well. First 64 UrbanDictionary internet rules (with altern8 descriptive letter name maps). Fighting game names &&
characters. Sports, teams, && player names. Company categories && names. Maybe Periodic Table elements. Countries, computer hardware companies, software
companies, cars, banks, animals, foods, music && movie genres, franchises, studios, titles, directors, producers, actors, etc. so that each selectable item
often has both a direct ordered index && at least a single abbreV8ion that may vary independently, permitting periodic reorderings while still leaving the
hopefully more common (or harder to alter) reference intact. Defining a bunch of good initial default map sets is probably a good idea, but making sure to also
support 64x64 && 4096x4096 as well as secondarily 16x16 && 256x256 then tertiarily 10x10, 100x100, etc. will also surely prove essential for certain entrenched
decimal contexts. Might be useful to have some collapse utility to invert gener8 expansions.

Had thought of m8 st8s as typically encapsul8ing 8 mini-r8d-tr8 boxes or bars.

For gener8ing abbreV8 map of St8 names, match any letters in names in rarity order until none left. Apply this general principle 2 all l8r autom8d V8s gener8d.

Might be better selecting best rel8d named colors than attempting to gener8 them. gener8 could try to lookup closest named colors.

AbbreV8 should also be able to gener8 the minimum unique components for all names in a domain.

Lowercase meaning higher b64 indices is inconsistent, but worth it.

Origin of base m8rix is upper-left starting right then rows down, but all other orient8ions, diagonal stepping, windings, or other useful orders should be
options. Hopefully raD8 or dil8 or circul8 and curv8 can make curves as accessible as m8rix aims to make perpendicular axis-aligned squares.

Might want to give m8 st8s affinity in gravit8ion && repulsion.

Once many useful d8a domains are logically mapped into 8x8 m8rices, arbitrary sections of existing text can design8 selections.

As a general rule, the most prevalent ordering should be the default order in indexed mode for basic arrangement. Then many sets should also have a more
prominent ordering that attempts to abbreV8 the most commonly useful elements with the earliest unalloc8d letters that their names contain.

Sometimes ordering based on popularity will be a good idea, although usually just inheriting any established alphabetical order && then overlaying a mapping of
the best abbreV8ions available will suffice.

Many d8a sets have more than 64 items && are difficult to represent well within such constraints, but hopefully the seemingly arbitrary limit can maximize
utility. Liberties should be taken to shoehorn d8a sets into 8 or 64. Similar breaks should occur at multiple b64 char boundaries so 4,096 && 262,144 &&
16,777,216 && 64**5...

Maybe V8 needs a global registry for both ends. There's also a local `V8` aliaser && wrapper.

Maybe global registry should start with a sort of conceptual constructionist form of the known physical universe, so like 0 would be sub-quarks or whatever
&& then outward into structures && their top at least 64 terminologies, building out through components, concepts, && phyla then out to cosmology &&
constell8ions, then back in to more Earth-centric compounds, terrain, clim8s, geography, then countries, St8s, counties, cities, places, people, etc. each
shooting for at least top8 or top64 as examples of how a huge constructive view can be grown out systematically && personally (or eventually in a collabor8ive
way, if a common growing set proves worth everyone maintaining together). If a common growing set is desirable, of course some sets of d8a will end up being
disconnected so either scheduled reorderings will be necessary or meta-d8a about the l8r additions to earlier groups will probably be needed. Users will
likely need to use some particip8 voting type stuff to decide what proposed additions should be accepted. Maybe just git is right for this already though?
Maybe some additional diffing && merging logic could be written to ease growing combin8ions of d8a. All 8 d8a will need to merge, not just globals.

It'd be cool to show columns of indices mapping to abbreV8ions, vice-versa, && both to any other maps, maybe even showing the destin8ion st8 name at the
source departure arrow of the m8 link since they're somewhat likely to span beyond view.

8 is hard to start on so try to start super-basic && make the global index as a text file with newlines separ8ing entries allowing duplic8s. Write scripts to
gener8 sets prepared for abbreV8ions in context. Start classes to make st8s out of globals && m8s between them. Make coordin8s, str8s, circul8s, curv8s, &&
build out graphical represent8ion for all.

It'll be good when I can r8 my estim8d confidence or concern for development issues with greater precision than just "maybe" or "?".

Maybe encoded b64 d8s && Chess not8ion can never catch on beyond me. d8ok should have text, line, bars, grid, && radial views.

d8 is also a gradu8d str8 mechanism for navig8ing through time. Even high-precision kernel timings should become importable. My base-64 && m8rix are
both excellent for indexing or toggling any bit in a 64-bit number (which is less than G0000000000 in b64 or 18446744073709551616 in b10). Bit-patterns &&
their respective rel8ions may seem elusive for a long time but it will be good to reinforce the inherent rel8ionship between binary && more familiar and
easily attainable spectrum values with the few numbers of bits they require.

Hmm. Maybe gradu8 should be mainly 0..8 with thicker taller bars into the main square but the index should be shown 0..7:0..7 sub precision in dark. Then
below that is a separ8 b64:b64 bar too, with its own whole bits on the left too. Would be cool to get StepMania files to do visualiz8ion too && learn how
they are made.

Maybe try to make the 8 machine for I88 (August 8th, 2018) && make Octology worth launching in that way by that time. Around 6 years from now should be
generous enough to hopefully have to be moved up somewhat. We'll see.

I was curious how to spell "reving" when I thought of writing it:
[pip@AkuCCE31hZ~/dox/2du]dict reving
No definitions found for "reving", perhaps you mean:

Apparently vim's K key is normally unbound && unmapped but in my editor it will show the man page of whatever command is under the editor cursor. Handy. =)
Maybe vim Ctrl-l shouldn't upd8 statusbar's l8st pt. Also would be cool if Ctrl-n && p could detect whether multiple windows have opened instead of
buffers && cycle through those as next && prev altern8ly. Maybe vim's lines, columns, percent complete, ASCII of char under cursor, current buffer number, etc.
should all become 0-based b64 also?

m8rix should be able to stretch into basin games.

Would be cool to build unlimited bitmap fonts from m8rices then be able to drag highlight any area && color with fg or bg by pressing V8 key. Could even draw
individual pixels too (just in that instance, in every instance in "terminal", or str8 into font itself which would change instances globally, && maybe other
good granularities too). Maybe different sized bitmaps could all be scaled to interoper8 && hopefully variable-width could eventually be handled similarly.
This coloring idea is pretty awesomely tactile. Gr8 for demonstr8ions. Picking fonts just for selctions could be quite cool too.
I've noticed that GnomTerm seems to mainly have a separ8 bkgr blacK color then like a 2pal8 of 16 bright colors that all should read well above bkgr but not
over each other. I think my style of keeping a little over half very bright && a little under half very dark with better contrast between the groups is
superior. More bright colors can be in a m8rix 8pal8.

8sh && viii should both eventually behave similarly to vim's editing style where major events can easily be undone && redone, but where the .swp file d8a
is stored with the file so that the entire construction history can be reviewed from any saved file rather than just having access to those edits made during
the current editing session. Should also be able to show individual keys typed && mouse clicks at input undo levels below the default level. Maybe termin8 is
a good name for an 8 terminal applic8ion or too confusing? 8term? Then 8sh can be within like zsh, then viii && others. Still need to figure out why zsh
prompt && vim statusbar pts rarely chop off frames.

Maybe 8term target text dimensions are 80x25 && 160x50 for compatibility with most standard text-mode applic8ions. If character bitmaps are usually 8x16
pixels, then those geometries would be nice 640x400 or 1280x800. I'd like to support decent scaling which will crE8 a necessary transl8ion between physical &&
applic8ion pixels.

Would be cool to edit separate layers of colors, texts, && fonts to composite into normal view. Could even intentionally hide edits to background pixels that
will be obscured by foreground text. That will probably mainly be done at the normal pixel level but it'd be cool to be able to add tiny icons or notes that
are only visible when you zoom way in (or maybe twinkle occasionally as a hint of their diminutive presence)?

Would be cool to optionally have multiple background or foreground layers, when desirable. Also, I'm thinking pal8 definitions may be best to leave Alpha
transparency levels apart, so they can be applied intentionally at more appropriate conceptual levels according to usage rather than per color.
Maybe that's wrong though && it should be RGBA as usual?

Cards presently go A-Za-z with AKQJT9-2 going through all spades first, then hearts, diamonds, && finally clubs. Chess pieces index 0-Fm-_ just as they'd
initially lay in a m8rix at the start of a game. Each of these are useful for their purposes but a V8 map (m8ing) would probably be more descriptive &&
better for general use. For each set's map, lowercase should indic8 blacK while uppercase cards are Red && Chess pieces are White. Both sets should
individually be fit just within letters. Hearts start  AKQJTIHSXVFRW with spades as the lowercase version of that. The logic is: nIne,eigHt,Seven,siX,
fiVe,Four,thRee,tWo. Then diamonds should start     as EGUCNBDLMOPYZ for acE,
kinG,qUeen,jaCk,teN, then diamonds 9-2 probably can't abbreV8 number names any further (except maybe shifting O over P for fOur or on the end for twO)
so they simply inheret all letters remaining in order. Lowercase diamonds for clubs.
Similarly, White Chess pieces should be RIBQKSTO && PAWNCDEF with blacK lower. I think these are pretty good && preferable to just indexed.

I should still aim to support alternative b64 encodings smoothly, in case others have different needs or priorities. Hopefully I can build my V8 alloc8ion
gener8ion utility to take all the color names, USt8s, cards, pieces, etc. && autom8 setting them as above based on good consistent rules && prepared
prioritized subsets of element names in order to yield the V8 maps that have the nicest properties in extending their purpose. I like the idea of an 8term
which can change geometry of characters or pixels smoothly. Maybe the backend for 8term && 8sh should be something like GnomTerm, screen, && zsh for
compatibility, recognizing that any 8 extensions of functionality will likely diverge quite a bit from old terms && shells.

Possible to double-map Chess pieces into whole 64, if desired.

I'm thinking about how what I want may be something like an actual virtual terminal where it can behave like a text-based terminal program, but in
addition to changing text geometry, existing text should also be scalable both with optional aspect r8io constraints && every text pixel may actually be
individual (or joined) polygons (or cubes). These will be virtual pixels within fonts which can be dragged around or toggled. Such pixel manipul8ion should
optionally modify the stored bitmap font itself (&& simultaneously every existing occurence) or just the font locally for a particular d8a domain like
just this singular instance or every one of these on this line, in this sentence, paragraph, on this page, in this file or within this design8d d8a category.
Every modific8ion should be easily undoable && auto-saved.

I've also been thinking about 64-bit numbers being the archetypal base 8x8 m8rix because a single bit per intersection is the minimum d8a that could fit that
way. A m8rix will typically contain 64 b64 values, which are 6-bits each or 384-bits. Eventually, a m8rix should also contain elaborate st8s with complex
d8a. 64-bit numbers can be written with 11 b64 characters (wasting 2 bits). I like the idea of 64-bit numbers being tiles of m8rix bit patterns seen in
every included && detected bitmapped font that has dimensions of 8. All fonts should be joined into a global little m8rix icon registry of 64-bit numbers
found (or edited beyond). From these, virtual fonts should be built which can easily be extended in the number of characters they contain, their resolution,
maybe even adding more than 1 bit for color or intentional alpha. Eventually, complex glyph shapes of scalable fonts will also be shaped within existing
bitmapped character boundaries for both to become harmonious. I'd like it all to be able to appear quite like a text screen in a typical terminal && be as
interoperable as gnome term if possible, but capable of arbitrary layers of additional complexity of altering text fonts or colors or individual pixels in
all the expressive ways that current text modes lack. It would be awesome if I could do all that && figure out how to run any shell within it compatibly, even
though I mainly intend to run only my own 8sh perl port of zsh && psh. So even if 8sh requires 8term in order to provide extensive functionality (like all the
mentioned modific8ions above), it'd be nice if 8term could be a respectable term on its own. Making every visible font virtual pixel a 3D cube might be
slow but sounds like a modest amount of d8a that should be manageable at decent framer8 so optimiz8ion might become necessary as pixels get small && text
dimensions expand to large displays. 8sh should make it easy to auto-filter any command output to be different colors or fonts (or further format or
reprocess).

Maybe it's better just to use FontForge && gbdfed to convert my nostalgic bitmaps to hopefully Unicode .otf or something scalable that pretends pixels &&
should probably be whatever those two prefer as open font output formats for whatever I include in 8 as mainly 8x8 or 64x64 m8rix constrained bitmapped
fonts that I prefer && use && extend && want to demonstr8.
Shit! FontForge is so excellent. I'm sure gbdfed is too. They seem pretty thorough && make my 8x8 focus feel too gimmicky && rigid by comparison.

A basic "8" character in an 8x8 font has been contempl8d for a logo.

Probably compiling my global index registry && working on my favorite 8x8 && 8x16 fonts to be scalable to maybe 8term are good places to start. The registry
should start with 64 top categories that each get 64 members starting with core universe objects, concepts, maybe recognized not8ion figures as well as
prominent personalities. That's already 4096 of the most important fundamental things I can imagine && it'll surely take quite some effort to compile, without
much code compil8ion. Should I just skip that for now? Come back to it && just start with simplest examples? Surely easier to do that but misses an opportunity
for increased coherence && stimul8ing research which might improve remaining design earlier, like better anticip8ion properties? For Chemistry, do I just
cutoff at 64 (PTable.Com) Gd Gadolinium (Good G-d?) && do I dare renumber them from 0? =O

That's totally the kind of decision that I'm crazy to indulge, right? Anyone who knows existing numbers of elements will be one-off from 8. Oh well? Maybe
it shouldn't be default. I'm learning drums, counting 0-7 instead of the normal 1-8 right now too. What am I thinking?
That would initially ditch out on Gold, Mercury, && other important elements above 64 too. I'd still bet there's a huge correl8ion between the lower numbers &&
the incidence in the universe, but like can I just trunc8 Gold && Mercury from my early simul8ion, then of course introduce it l8r when it deserves such
attention? Am I chopping off my own nose to ignore so many significant elements when I'm obviously compiling important lists? Maybe it's a st8ment to say the
top64 rule-of-thumb will serve well, && we'll get to your gold && Termin8or2 quicksilver l8r.

If everything is supposed to scale, I think I should simplify to top8 first, knowing intent to expand to most useful top64 && beyond. Their alloc8ions of
abbreV8ions could conflict across levels for gener8ions if they don't look forward enough though. Chemistry can also of course include popularity in some
fashion such that Gd probably is no longer in && Gold is. That probably fits other approaches better && makes the reindexing of elements from 0 more pal8able.
Still seems kinda ridiculous to list just 8 or 64 top elements when so many more are known.
So my top8 top8 might be:
  d8        fields:  zY,MD hm,sf  zoneYear,MnthDaay hourmnut,scndfram
  color      codes:  WR,OY GC,BM  WhytRedd,OrngYelo GrenCyan,BlueMgnt

  atomic particles:  NP,En pD,dO  NtrnPrtn,Elctntno phtnDkmt,dknrOrbt
  elements        :  Hh,OC NI,nS  Hydrheli,OxygCrbn NeonIron,ntrgSlcn
  suits       card:  sh,dc AK,QJ  spadhart,dmndclub AyceKing,QuenJack
  DN8         ckm8:  AC,TG RN,BP  AdniCyto,ThmnGuan RookNght,BshpPawn
No Wisc yet. Looks like W will go to Wshg && w to Wisc in 64.
I totally can't think of crap right now. Hmm. That looks fscking nice! I should color it. =) This is still quite a bit of some sense of coding in just text.
  d8          days:  sM,TW tF,Sh  sundMond,TuesWeds thurFrid,Shabhbat
   8th-       day circumciz8ion? Love for Judaism, even if I'm not believing.

Troy was talking good about the Sun though too, && Islam are the first three I think of. Monotheistic generally. Hinduism. Buddhism. Taoism. Sikh. Atheist.
Maybe it's improper to categorize Atheist as a religion being the implied void
of one.              CI,HB SJ,ON  CrstIslm,HnduBdhs SikhJwsh,OthrNnrl
And there's my bridge to decimal. I tried 2 more than the first solid top64 right there. Neither seemed to work too well, but they brought my thumbs into
the picture I guess.
I see what I did there too! I cheated on days && added an 8th day of heaven. Why does religion have to muck up top8 into like traditional top ten? TopA?
Imagining glimpsing the d8 line of all file edits ever made seems dope. Want! Drawable foreground && background colors will be bomb too!

Maybe in 8sh make mo as more && most replacement that respects lspt colors fully && hopefully encoded font overrides too.

So 8 is a mad experiment with intentionally superb customiz8ion capabilities like making Curses::Simp's tie'd array interface extend to 8term with:
  BkgrFrgrfontText (&& maybe always an additional alternate set to make 8?)
Maybe all text can be 3D cubes && fractal DJ Gd bouncing visualiz8ion. Alpha'd with 3D ckm8 anim8ing Chess board pulsing && moving to the music.
Maybe sometimes vivid floating && rot8ing between text's Bkgr && Frgr or entirely behind && respective alphas oscill8.
I like the idea of a new Blast Battle Chess where the Rook can become the big rock golem && belch && blast beams with Dubstep chirps && eat Queens with
some squealing && crunching. The adjacent enemy pieces should show aggression or cower toward their cell borders && maybe occasionally poke each other or
start having cute && orn8 idle anim8ions. It would be cool to show pieces blast to where they're being considered for movement, demonstr8ing heuristic && the
whole demonstr8 video culmin8ing in completion of the tutorial text && autom8d ckm8 game in time with the 8-minute music. Spitting on each other && little
skirmishes sound extravagant but fun. I want lots of colors, lights, lasers, particles. Music bass shaking text virtual pixels && ckm8 pieces could be totes
cool. Knock 'em down && have them clamor up, wobble, try to stabilize, break into dancing. ;)
It'd be cool to have a Rook with enough detail to have a mouth to eat the Queen again, or maybe stone her if something else can work. Maybe for all them, I
should not worry about any realism or cartoonness && just make them all metallic (hopefully reflective) robots closely resembling traditional popular
Chess pieces but which all can blast exploratory or sustained && deadly lasers at each other. This motif should let my models && anim8ions remain quite
primitive && rigid, yet hopefully still swag && synchronized to some DubstepLyrics.
Maybe 8ris can be whatever I adapt from Tetris which can also show up, along with f8l fighter, sk8 (with AShomsky vids to Dubstep too), Qb8 for qbix, etc..
Overlay for ckm8 pieces should also have RIBQKSTO && PAWNCDEF show movement
description characters              like:+#X**X#+    vvvvvvvv with the stars
actually 4 lines like +X together && Queen's is bigger than King's. Pawn v should also have iI bisecting them to show str8 option. I think octothorpe for
kNights fits it best && need to lookup what the 8-star is called again. BRB. The Nipponese typographic ReferenceMark is cool && close with:
※  21A6 1-2-8 U+203B  kome        (米  ?, "rice"       )
                      komejirushi (米印?, "rice symbol")
This symbol is used in notes (注, chū) as a reference mark, similar to an asterisk. MogenDavid ✡ U+2721.
                 EightPointed           blacKStar: ✴ U+2734

CircledOpenCenterEightPointed                Star: ❂ U+2742
Asterisk.AskDefine.Com says RedHotChiliPeppers symbol is 8-pronged asterisk. Maybe that one will have to be an image. I should make virtual fonts support
all the known Unicode code-points I can find as easily as possible. Maybe 8PntdblaKStar should be King && RHCP icon with flat ends bolder for Queens.
I'll probably just render or draw myself some bitmaps of those for importing into my extended virtual VGA fonts that will actually become scalable
themselves, though not n8ively vector-based. I want virtual pixels to make all pixels more accessible to everyone. Eventually, I should be able to have text
screens that perfectly map one character to any particular meaning so that any available Unicode character can identify any representable color or font for
whatever particular text character is to be rendered that way, but 8 && 64 should also be gr8 starts.

There's already at least an OctoStar company && PokerStars player but maybe it's cool if I call the RHCP symbol my main OctoStar that describes joystick &&
traditional map directions as well as 3x3 8 octants selection mechanism. The knIght octothorpe can approximately describe selecting OctoStar segments when
selections are better not being axially or diagonally aligned.

I want to learn my Dad's memory techniques && develop 8 enough to write him colorfully too. 8 may need italics && underlines as well.

Gotta remember for 8sh that parameters should keep starting with 1 like other shells since $0 for the full command belongs at that beginning.
Looks like fixing l name sorting will take another layer of lspt too.
Darn! lspt && Utl are totally using variables as escapes indirection but I should totally define it all in 8 colors && manipul8 it more readily. Escape
codes need to be gener8d but even as variables not as useful.

So I'm clean-sl8ing lspt as l && probably absorbing c8 (for cut), before I write coll8 to use loc8 to find && remove largest duplic8s. Need b64 sorting
for names as default (&& unmolested original ls output ordering with an additional command-line option). Or not. Maybe lspt is already good enough &&
l should just alias to it. Rewrite it l8r.

Thinking of Gematria && the potency of letters being numbers in general, it would be really cool to show that most English words or texts can then be
viewed as cohesive numerically as well as linguistically. You could see or curv8 the pattern between any letter values, show various averages across the
word, convey the sum, product, etc. so that words, phrases, sentences, a ton of text can be quantified in previously unfamiliar ways. Anagrams are close but
I think are themselves only a notable component of Gematria. Of course it'd be nice to apply such techniques to traditional Gematria in Hebrew, to make that
more accessible && profound, for myself && HaShem.
Cool puzzles could be made of the numerical word sizes, dealing with them in the order they occur in whatever input text you choose (or is automatically
provided). Any text could be stepped through with timed delays where each letter describes another note, instrument or other sound, adding syncop8ion,
etc. or letters can be considered by the respective difference (&& direction) between them. There'd be quite an art to mapping what letters should do what &&
when, but it'd be neat to connect arbitrary input text to gener8 cool things && intentionally assoC8 words as audibly interpreted sounds. Maybe combine this
with like AudioSurf or N2O for bonus. Of course most English words can already easily be quantified as b64 strings themselves, but it may provide a more
intuitive rel8ionship with letters && their respective numerical values if they are also conveyed very much relative to each other as opposed to solely within
the b64 encoding... yet the encoding is what design8d them as worth being imbued with precisely the chosen numerical values, so there's no way to get too far
from it.

So words can easily be themselves b64 numbers, interpreted as d8 codes relative to each other, or summed, averaged, etc. numerically maybe each with uses.
8term && 8sh should also behave like screen to multiplex && detach && share logged in terminal sessions.
Can't forget plan8s: MV,Em JS,UN  MercVnusErthmars JuptStrnUrnsNptn (honorary Plut). Maybe S should go to Sun && M to Moon though, from a more
Erth-centric heavenly body view. 8 plan8s fits pretty nicely so maybe sun can be N && moon can be O (with double reference like O for rOOk in Chess). Maybe
Sun should be 0? Kinda cool with mOOn O.

8sh $/p(rompt|S1)/i can have separate ENV vars for layers of aligned colors, fonts, && text with replacements for usr,host,etc. as design8d c8 fields.
Would be kinda neat to take whatever commands you've just run in 8sh in the scrollback buffer of 8term && just run viii on it, like shifting up status &&
command bars at the bottom && naturally navig8ing or editing whatever just scrolled by && is normally lost. The amount stored for use this way should
surely be configurable. Would probably be a rather eye-opening demonstr8ion for most GNU/Linux geeks. I'm trying to plan a lot of that. Dragging font pixels
around && immeD8 text coloring will probably also be remarkably demonstrable. Would be neat to take any onscreen text && break it into 8x8 character blocks
that can show rings of color && can maybe rot8 their contained text opposite ways && adjacent blocks rings can be ROYG && CBMP so the visible could warp to
show 8x8 segments vividly.

Was it Mr.Renfrew from Griffith Jr.High where I drew pir8 skulls who introduced me to: ZO,Tt Ff,Ss  ZeroOnneTwoothre FourfiveSixxsevn .. EhytNinete(n)n(e)lvn?
It may be seen as unfortun8 that a typical elipsis of 2 or 3 dots is a valid b64 number, but context should distinguish, just as it does for standard English
abbreV8ions && sentence termin8ion. Ctrl-n next buffer in viii should default through prioritized layers, && automap to next window before or after any
available next buffers. PT needs to be upgraded to d8 with at least zone && shouldn't need Eon, Millenium, Century, or jinx anymore.

Thinking of slurping my c8 (cut u from cut && add 8) into Utl && adding parameters for -C color codes for output fields, supporting dash spans, columns, other
modes, maybe -CN# color codes for the actual character columns within the # b64 number index of the field that needs more colors than just solid. Also add
params to -J then codes to right-justify or center instead of left default or -P codes of how many characters to pad each respective output field. Sheesh,
should have sprintf interface. ;) cut actually has -f fields (supposed default), -c characters, -b bytes, -d delimiter (instead of Tab). All long forms are
s/^/--/;s/$/=LIST/; except where -d gets DELIM. -n (ignored). --complement invert set of selected f,c, or b. -s, --only-delimited do not print lines not
containing delimiters --output-delimiter=STRING use STRING as the output delimiter. default is to use the input delimiter. --help. --version. Maybe I can make
it almost entirely compatible with plain standard cut but a super8 version that simply maps 8 color codes into standard shell escape sequences for fields, then
maybe add header, footer, alternate pattern && color codes, etc. so that I can tidy lspt (which eventually should at least be renamed to lsd8 if not just l) &&
start wrapping, coloring, parsing, reprocessing all manner of useful utilities && then make my coll8 loc8 tool to find largest files, match && color duplic8s,
maybe default dump a lot of colored status info or progress if specified to autom8 removals according to defined logic, or a similar Curses interactive
interface to manually configure the logic before proceeding with prioritized largest duplic8 removals. Hopefully my Curses::Simp interface can be upd8d as well
to resemble whatever layers 8sh gets as closely as possible.

cut also accepts FILE which mine should do too. I don't know if I care to be fully compatible with standard cut except maybe in the long form.
Instead of just explicit color codes per column of a particular field, a code should also specify known additional processing, like file-system permissions,
d8, file type && extensions, etc. && maybe c8 can be interactive Curses also where you run a command internally, configure colors for it, then it gets
auto-wrapped for l8r invoc8ions. Maybe option to expand input tabs to spaces with varying logic. I'm leaning toward c8 standing alone rather than glomming into
my presently monolithic Utl since all 8 stuff should probably be together && not intertwined with my personal stuff, if it's avoidable.
8sh should allow you to enter a command but just draw a Blue $ && output the command on the same line still, also optionally appending a newline after.
Probably especially useful for things like pwd,passwd, maybe even ssh && scp, && whatever other common commands usually have quick singular output. Maybe it
could be right-justified or centered in remaining space too. Wrapping all ps fields && formats could be tedious, but maybe c8 can make it more manageable.
Maybe c8 kinda stands for 8's character column  cutting colorizer...
                              crafting  crE8ive custom  conveyances? =)

I should probably squeeze my ANSI escape code color mapping to 8 codes first in ENV vars like 8C#2ANSI= where # is 8 color code && following is map to ANSI
then Utl && c8 should each try to load those but have their own defaults. It crops, clips, chops, chips, chomps, chunks, connects, && concatN8s?
So configurably wrap && represent all known options for ls or ps. Make simple d8 like date && l8 like cal. Maybe common coloring stuff should be abstracted
into 8.pm if they can't just pass an ENV variable of codes to c8 but still need to duplic8 similar behavior. uptime,w,whoami,finger $USER,uname -a,df,du,free.
Should make 2-way gener8 Utl for .lsrc <-> .8/8lrc that just has 8 color code sections && regexes (preserving reciprocal comments && formatting as well as
possible) maybe auto-sorting && compacting, && explicit or gener8d altern8 sets to show variability among default common files with ability to regener8 .lsrc
&& $LS_COLORS from altern8s as well.

I haven't been able to make any progress on c8 yet because I'm confusing it with 8sh as a good place to manipul8 standard commands. For many things, it's
likely to be better if things aren't just piped through c8 with basically duplic8 parameters as directions to know how to interpret the prior ls command
or whatever. A proper wrapper controls the invoking of the underlying command so that it can inspect the passed parameters && anticip8 how to handle them
thoroughly. Maybe c8 can be a stepping stone to 8sh which deleg8s ls fully to l which will know how to columnize similarly or properly detect if it's being
piped out && rm columns && colors to be somewhat compatible with existing ls. l should also optionally show Ki?B,Mi?B,Gi?B, all file-stamps, && auto-show
probably dark well-separ8d subdirectories, salient attributes by file-type, && contents previews where they'll fit on the line. c8 should be potent but is
probably not the right place to funnel everything through. Try to balance making c8 a super cut, l super ls, d8 super date && pt, l8 super cal, etc..

Should add b64 counts of dirs files symlinks, then show most popular extensions as will fit on the top /^t0tl:/ line. Regular dir listings should be trailed by
contents (clearly delimited) too, empty ls does not show total but empty `ls -l` does. Either way, empty l shouldn't have an extra new-line.
Ryu's `ls -a` sorts all hidden dot-files first, which is a better default than Aku's ignoring the dot && interspersing them. Actually better to have default
sort be by my b64 characters so digits, uppercase, lowercase, ., && _;

Oh yeah, my 8sh with integr8d 8scrn (likely my version of GNU screen) should also be able to restore (Dead ???) sessions without resorting to -wipe, if I
can figure out how to perform that. My scrns are usually 2du,rut,muz,&& irc, each probably with different challenges in being able to preserve enough
construction && progress st8 to be able to reboot without even having to detach && pickle sessions ahead of time, yet still being able to login && reattach
them revived. The inherent ability to multiplex every shell session between local && remote terminals, as well as local full-screen text-mode virtual consoles,
in a transparent way is also functionality I've desired for a long time too.

Thanks to Sasha for reminding me that 8 is also a Fibonacci number. Mathematics is the language of n8ure! ;) It's either the 7th or 6th depending on whether
you start with 0 or 1 respectively, so index would be 6 or 5. Of course all else equal, I prefer the former options that start with 0. Tiled squares &&
spirals are good stuff.

Thinking about framework for 8top8 m8rix of each initial set && how to design8 them. Also thinking about 8sh && c8 coloring columns. Maybe serializ8ion can
include otherwise ignored escape codes to specify bitmapped font changes amidst the stream of ANSI color escapes && plain-text. Mine should n8ively be planes
with one b64 character per screen rendered character with initially text, in font, with foreground, on background... so 4 main planes which can be stored or
modified distinctly, yet are bound to each other in intentional alignment.
They can also be gener8able from each other based on applic8ion of patterns (like Perl regexes for syntax highlighting). Might be pretty tricky to sneak
whatever else through escape codes. Seems like ESC _  Applic8ionProgramCommand 0x9F then string parameter followed by ESC \  StringTermin8or 0x9C is best bet.
Serialized view might be brief && often preferable to the planar view so editor should facilit8 easy preserv8ion && manipul8ion of them inline with regular
text, allowing a toggle to render or expose codes (likely disabling any other syntax highlighting when desiring the rendered escape view, so they aren't
confused for each other). Need good tools to convert between layered && serial formats. Also tricky thinking of 8term, 8scrn, 8sh, && viii each being distinct,
yet potentially hyper-connected to preserve 8 layers. Maybe viii should just be 8 from the command-line, which will attempt to spawn an 8scrn, 8sh, && viii
inside of whatever actual term, screen, && shell it is found in. Maybe that's the default but there's a flag option to attempt to spawn own separ8 graphical
SDL window rather than try to interoper8 with old non-8 terminals. Would be nice to try to take gr8st advantage of existing environment without automatically
absorbing much more though, as a general guiding principle. If aggressive interpret8ion of 8 powers is design8d, then they can hopefully informatively propag8.

Maybe default 8 layers of text, font, fgcl, bgcl doubled can show alpha-phasing menus as replacements, overlays, or underlays for whatever normal text would
also align there. This can allow 8 menus in text to share normal text applic8ion space, only periodically revealing their loc8ions like a slower flashing text
cursor, maybe becoming hotter as cursors approach or hotkey activ8s. This would allow things like vim's statusbar && command line to normally be hidden, &&
only materialize on approach, or shell or screen could periodically reveal their own relevant status inform8ion. Neat to think of dropping editor on shell
scrollback, then toggling ls permission bits, drawing colors && fonts, rerunning reflecting upd8s. 8sh having vim command mode to 'u' undo or Ctrl-r redo edits
too (as well as deeper tree navig8ion edit options). I want more dynamic pixels from the outset so maybe defaulting to graphical (with more advanced notions of
font text which can hold more than 1 bit of pixel color inform8ion per m8rix cell). Embedding additional layers of colored pixels amidst any existing text or
optionally drawing directly into the font(s) should convey an expressiveness && immediacy that is often lost in computing, I think.
In addition to doubling layers, might also or instead have per character 1 of 64 anim8ions, sound effects, icon graphics, or video, which would all probably
need separate timing d8a, && may not be good for that reason. Hmm.
Maybe just doubling layers first, then eventually introducing d8 timing mechanism, which allows for additional layers of timed anim8ions, morphs, effects,
audio, video, etc..

Abstracting Simp into col8 with base text planes for use by all others would probably be beneficial. I also feel that maybe I should start with an abbreV8ion
gener8ion utility or class which loads prioritized lists of element names && then alloc8s single b64 chars for each that work well for all my initially defined
d8a sets.
Maybe whenever sync'd Chun's setup && Aku's 8 upd8s back to Ryu, reorg ~/*/ && especially dvl in prep for 8 PerlModule projects. Maybe
  Octology::(gener8|abbreV8|coordin8|gradu8|m8rix|pal8|f8|col8|st8|[wdrm]8|8term|8scrn|8sh|viii|ckm8|f8l)?
Gener8ing the best default m8rix 8pal8 will probably be the most significant && exalted b64 encoding, as it has those scalars in my Utl presently && will
crucially color all components of following 8 objects && interfaces. So I should probably just pick && basically hard-code whatever seems best, then
meekly gener8 those values based on configurable alter8ion logic which injects for this supreme 8top8 color set. Come up with maybe cool gears iconography to
represent gener8 && have abbreV8 as a caricature roaring V8 engine, if I can muster something suggestive && appealing for those.
So maybe some preliminary col8 stuff can improve c8 && l (which should also get s8 as 8 sort which does b64 [&& numerical] by default && d8 accounting for
zone where specified).

Maybe test col8 && c8 by wrapping dict with colors (&& history). Exercise ability to liberally chop empty lines && even reformat as desired. Rewrite Curses,
cut, sort, ls, grep, most, vim, zsh, screen, && rest of common CLI. I can get a lot done && make eventual progress on ckm8 if I simply keep trying.

The grand theory of 8 is to facilit8 vast maximally efficient referentE8ion amongst a constrained prioritized arrangement of 8s that can expand to encompass
anything useful. It means to introduce implicit && explicit contexts. The implied, intuitive, popular, && then traditional are generally preferred in that
order. I'm recasting entrenched traditions like clock labeling && Chess not8ion. I'm probably overkill on chemistry elements && UnitedSt8s but I guess I'll
just have to see those through as potential.

I imagine 8 inspiring crE8ive coloriz8ions of all manner of fonts && graphics. I like collabor8ion ideas like shared cursor through scrn multiplexing but also
separate friendly cursors too. I like the 8x8 colored text view of ckm8. Should maybe convert to b64 not8ion && anim8? Not in Simp. Wait for col8.

The view would be somewhat beautiful above the basic colored text lower right cornered d8 clock (which should be able to become radial && bars) as vibrant
perspectives on games you wish to observe, preserve, or particip8 in. Playback probably primarily good with just 1-to-1 piece movements to clocked delay.

viii should allow for serial color escape prefixes to be shown tersely && toggled with list for tabs && newlines. Auto-converting between layered mode.
Of course mouse drag drawing too. Rows can expand to show layers or collapse.

D1BAlLK: So I'm thinking I should get back on e-mail && repay AEPi, order a good HDTV, Corsair speakers, HDMI cables && audio adapter for PS3, && SlimBlade.
get l8st Perl && SDL stuff on Chun,Ryu,&& Aku, start absorbing && drawing favorite fonts into col8 to work with layers of fonts && colors, figure out how
to encode font-change escapes in addition to fg && bg, setup initial pal8, start abbreV8 for early d8a sets, start running commands within preliminary 8sh
wrapper, flesh out c8 to work with both serialized escape encoded && new default layered mode, make a new colored most replacement, work coordin8 &&
gradu8 into w8 && d8, extrapol8 8sh && viii from zsh && vim.

Write detecting filters into c8 for ls, ps, etc.. Load all kinds of other timed d8a into d8 && start manipul8ing input && audio d8a within (video l8r).
My grep && every similar command should show filenames with .lsrc colors && multiple matches (or even dimmable syntax highlighting l8r too).

Since zone values appear to potentially occupy more than half their available slots, additional shifting does not look like it can be accommod8d, leaving the
possible Year range of a basic encoded d8 as somewhere between 1489-2511 (as it has been).
Slightly edited from my: ~/dox/web/htm/pht/pt/index.cgi:
The exceptions to the one-character-per-field rule are:
  0) For each 13 added to the Month,       add  64 to the Year.
  1) If the hour field is greater than 23, add 256 to the Year.
  2) If the Day  field is greater than 31,make the Year neg8ive b4 adding 2000.
These allow any 60th-of-a-second instant from Midnight New Year's of 1489 through the end of December 31st 2511 to be represented within its precise time zone.
It looks like there are 27 integer hour offsets which range from +14 to -12 around UTC. These are packed within 0..26 by subtracting the quantity of the
negative offsets from 27. Then there remain 13 additional zone offsets possible (that I've found on Wikipedia so far) that don't align on integer hours. I aim
to explicitly specify these as encoded zone values packed in indices 27..39 (where their value is not directly indic8ive of their rL8ive offset like 0..26, so
they must be looked up separ8ly). This thoroughness of support for existing misaligned zone offset values means there's insufficient room to handle any
additional Year shift within the zone field. Oh well. Broader Year ranges can probably be better accommod8d l8r with long-form d8 encoding anyway. Outliers:
  -09:30
  -04:30
  -03:30
  +03:30
  +04:30
  +05:30
  +05:45
  +06:30
  +08:45
  +09:30
  +10:30
  +11:30
  +12:45

I'm thinking I should try to get back into GMail, catch up, pay back generous && helpful AEPi brothers, sync to Ryu, get dvl libs && PerlSDL fully going, study
git again && get current on GitHub && maybe wrap with g8 && migr8 bak files into it, get at least simple bitmapped VGA fonts to render as nicely sizeable 3D
cubes for pixels, setup col8 && pal8, upd8 command-line d8,c8,l,g(rep)?,p(s)?,etc. to all have pretty colors, build out coordin8, gradu8, st8, tr8, m8rix, mk
d8 clock at least expandable text, bars, && raD8 forms, flesh out abbreV8 m8rices, work 8term, 8scrn, 8sh, && viii to all take advantage of col8
(FsckSlayerCursesKing), convey limit8ions on legacy terminal applic8ions in case users depend on compatibility (so only 16 colors, 8 background, && no font
varE8ion). Load timed d8a into a visual d8 str8 line or m8rix, start working on w8, r8, m8, neg8, fix8, prioritiz8ion, reput8ion, etc.. I'd like to support
both compatibility && expressive extension. I really like establishing my own human-readable text-based font format && aggreg8ing every font ever encountered
as fully available && customizable within 8, maybe auto-promoting fonts from 8x8 or 8x16 standards to maybe new font planes still bitmapped to 64x64 or 64x128,
allowing multiple colors, 8term && 8sh defaulting to 160x50 characters to create 1280x800 total virtual pixels within my hybrid text && graphical 8 applic8ion
windows. I'll probably also want to flesh out ckm8 && card games in there too. Colored textual Chess anim8ing sounds extremely cool to have && be able to play.
Maybe Cribbage && Poker would be cool for friends && fam too. Porting my old Win32 OpenGL QbixRube applic8ion to PerlSDL would be sweet too.

I think 8 can be contagious (go viral?) but pt never caught on before && has been relatively functional for many years now so maybe most of my ideas here
remain too cryptic to catch on anywhere else? Color codes instead of escapes seem that they will be vastly easier to work with in general, && demonstr8ing
thorough custom coloring techniques should convey gr8 power to almost any geek I can try to imagine. I may lack or lose motiv8ion to work on compatibility I
don't need in anticip8ion of those of others who might adopt my system someday. Also music notes normally changes in octaves of A-G for my 8 system too.
UnitedSt8s Presidents should probably be named && abbreV8d in reverse chronological order (maybe with the exception of most popular Washington &&
Lincoln deserving special intentional early recognition) so O for Obama, maybe w for gWbushJr., C for Clinton, B for BushSr., R for Reagan, N for Nixon, etc..

D1E96wS: Thinking of my 8 command-line abbreV8ion replacement && wrapper utilities like mo should be my more|less|most replacement. So 8 commands:
  8term: gnome-terminal|rxvt|aterm|xterm
  8scrn:         screen|tmux
  8sh  :"H"?        zsh|bash|psh (fully supporting ...* as multi-dir navig8ion)
  .    :             cd          (instead of built-in for source like in zsh, of course raw dirs without . should cd too, but maybe . as src is worth keeping?)
  l    :             ls|dir
  f    :           find          (with combined interface to loc8?)

  p    :             ps          (Process snapshot)
  c    :             wc          (Count characters, words, && lines && eventually bits, bytes, [KMGTPEZY]i?bits|Bytes, code points, paragraphs, subs, etc.)

  m    :            man|info

  sl   :             ln (maybe on this, since ln usually makes SymbolicLinks?)
  cl   :            calQl8 like my cln (maybe swapping so n reverses meaning to append Newline?)
  cls  :          clear (like DOS command for CLearScreen)
  viii : v8         vim (lowercased Roman Numerals for 8 where maybe my editor command name should alias as just `8` if possible too?)
  dif  :            vimdiff|diff|cmp|comm
  loc8 :             locate|find
  upd8 :           updatedb (as well as my tools to push dvl into bin && lib && upd8 may wrap g8 git && collabor8 to sync)
  uptm :           uptime
  uni  :           uniq
  dic  :           dict     (colored with reviewable history)

  ec   :           echo

  lsp  :          lspci
  lsu  :          lsusb
Probably leave already short stock cd,cp,ln,lp,ls,mv,ps,rm,wc,etc. unmolested. A lot of these are already just my aliases but should wrap with useful colors.

My b10 && b64 utilities will also become essential to typical 8 usage. Maybe just ch can interactively let you change mod,own,grp,sh,root,etc..
To plan all this feels like a new height of hubris. Minimal is just aliases, probable is filtered for new color8ion, unlikely is rewriting complete comparable
functionality from scratch. Maybe 8 aims to reinvent enough that it shall become its own new form of Oper8ingSystem, Pignux8 or Gnux8 "Gah-nukes-ate"?

It feels like just porting my QbixRube will be daunting enough, although it'd be super cool to enable rot8ions to fully reform the cube rather than stopping at
>45degrees && clicking or dragging cubelets or analyzing pictures taken of your own Rube would be much cooler to solve from (&& I'd like to bug-fix the
solution attempts that fall short too). Brute-forcing solutions might become feasible too, although compressing the internal represent8ion down to 64-bits
might remain mathematically unattainable. Who even cares about Rubik's anymore too? I think I want to make 8 FreeSoftware for Ubuntu GNU/Linux
(&& Debian, Gentoo, Mint, other distros, etc.) first, then Android for $8, then maybe PlayStation, iOS, MacOS, && Microsoft Windows8 for $64, if at all.

So are there religious undertones (or trappings) that are appropriate to attach to 8, like being baptized or BornAgain (with an e for bash) into new life?
V8 will be rather necessary to just do colors the way I want && may prove even more useful than editable colors or fonts in just referencing well known d8a
sets of 8 && 64. Be p8ient when development is slow. Document8ion is valuable too. Support compatibility modes even if old standard isn't selected as default.
My current colors are already quite pretty && sometimes captiv8ing to me so I should take some solace in that fact && appreC8 that pt, ptok, l, c8, && many
of my projected alias -> wrappers are already functional to varying degrees.

8 aims to become an ontology. Let it be. It should be normal && expected for it to gradually encompass absolutely everything. Certainly ambitious. Maybe
hubris. Oh well. So what? A little is done. Way more will always be planned. Relax. Attempting to cross every bridge before you come to it might not prove
necessary or beneficial either, although at least there's merit to the artistic value of doing so as far as I've already done.

Besides attempting to sell on Android, there may be other good ways to capitalize on portions of 8 that I can crE8, like utilizing eventual inherent
efficiencies in 8 to autom8 an EBay, CraigsList, or stock market money-making scheme. Maybe I could make my computing efforts into printable art or music that
people might want to buy from me? That could be pretty cool, but probably too far from my bailiwick to be worth intentionally aiming for. Best case might be
developing enough that I can parlay into doing custom contract programming quickly && powerfully for cash.

Maybe developing 8 will become fun it its own right too, && furthering 8top8 abbreV8ions of useful d8a sets will become vigorous && valuable to utilize in
certain niches for modest profit somehow. I really have pretty poor ideas of how I could ever monetize 8 at this point, but don't want to destroy any such
potential by letting the cat out of the bag too early either. Hopefully good solutions will present themselves at the right times.

Maybe I could flesh out cards && Poker && then enable anyone to play with each other, without *any* house rake (so way better earnings potential than any
alternative) in such a way that might even avoid some gambling laws by incorpor8ing reput8ion r8ings in a way that demonstr8s particular players' reliability
in paying losses directly (although then without much anonymity either, so there would be plenty of issues to resolve). Then I could autom8 my own AI && just
intentionally be a fair software player of my game. I'd also probably need to decentralize serving the games or make them Peer2Peer properly so that there's no
protest that I'm cheating with unfair access to the servers or something. Huge undertaking. Probably thoroughly illegal in the U.S. unless I can find some
loophole because I'm not a casino taking a rake or it can be sufficiently anonymous && P2P so that it can't effectively be shutdown either.

I used to think that reput8ion itself could become multifaceted as a composite value system that could support a monetary exchange system. If this were
designed to be sufficiently secure, minimally burdensome, && maybe primarily overseen directly by rel8d individuals, it might then be difficult to police.

I should learn enough about Android platforms' limit8ions && strengths in order to target such plaforms with worthwhile 8 applic8ions in a cohesive && natural
way, to have the best shot at any monetiz8ion through Google Play Store. My best earlier option is to develop major portions of 8 quietly for my own personal
use && then try to use benefits gained to code contracts fast && well (but carefully enough not to get sued or lose control of 8 in an avoidable way).

Try to make it all combine to make me more efficient && effective at programming than ever before (or than any of my current competition) so that I can
reestablish myself && work productively again. I refuse to sell the rights of even tiny parts of 8 off just for a paycheck though, so even this option will be
a minefield of careful contract selection && delinE8ion of ownership of whatever code results.

If I could actually make f8l or ov8ion or something else comparable to commercial applic8ion offerings, maybe selling licenses to just a complete game or
editor might be a better tactic. Any of those would require huge efforts before they could be released though, where contract work would probably resemble much
smaller tasks. Hmm.

Maybe giving 8 away && selling support sounds pretty good. Not quite sure how to go about that in a professional way, but there's probably good examples
in distros && established FreeSoftware projects. I think it will be quite a while before I feel like uploading to GitHub to allow branching && broader
development. Maybe by E6 June 2014, I can share privately with just Beppu-san && Keith whenever ready. Don8ions probably won't be sufficient to support me for
a longer amount of time, but selling ongoing support licenses of varying degrees of access to me && bounties on feature requests might be organic && lucrative
enough for me to provide worthwhile services (&& maybe assisted by friends at the right time).

I had planned to have the following done by D88 but now it's pushed back to E88. By then, I should be able to:
  0) get my  top8 bitmapped fonts to render as made of 3D cube virtual pixels
  1) build gener8 to start abbreV8ing my font names (with hints)
  2) get my 8top8 colors abbreV8d && easily mappable to above font characters
  3) build col8 to align layers of text, font, && colors
  4) start 8sh running shell commands && displaying scrolling colorful text
  5) port Time::PT to Octology::d8.pm (including classes, cmd-line utls, ptok, etc.)
  6) wrap most Unix commands in colorful ways that detect zsh or fledgling 8sh
  7) make f8 to edit fonts && pal8s with good output formats
Maybe not worrying too much about 8term or 8scrn at first would be best to limit my scope && the amount of preliminary research required. The above should
be ambitious but pretty attainable as simple text within the next year. After those are working:
  8) make coordin8, str8, gradu8, && m8rix (as more graphical widgets)
  9) make tr8s && st8s for (or from) all above d8a objects
  A) research useful d8a sets && gener8 cards,Chess,St8s,etc. in m8rices
  B) become able to either run screen,zsh,&&vim in 8 or mimic them extensively
  C) flesh out interactive d8 gradu8d str8s with stacking tokens or Frame spans
  D) make simultaneous binary, linear, 2D, && 3D perspectives on d8a values
  E) make w8 with cmd-line && graphical forms to manipul8 all standard units
  F) make r8 && m8 start working for d8a sets, abbreV8ions, && prioritiz8ion
If I get near F, I should extend the list to _. I should build the best demonstr8ion I can by E88.

I should upd8 PT to d8 with zone added soon. I think I should also develop d8 to have (in addition to the new default 8-character format) a 64-character format
that does away with PT's Century prefix && jinx suffix && uses the full 64ths of all fields not in the basic d8 8-character format. `d8 0` should yield 2000.
The fields should be YMDz hmsf in ROYG CBMP colors.

Extensive prefixing && suffixing for a 64 b64 character long form would be more consistent && natural with zone still squashed in the same spot in the middle
of the known date && time fields. The biggest downside seems to be requiring me to relearn color conventions for time fields that shift over because zone is
inserted where Green hour used to be. That does seem somewhat yucky, but probably worthwhile.

I probably shouldn't add jinx as 3600ths of a second but as 64ths of frames (or 3840ths of seconds) && all Year prefixes && jinx suffixes in the 64-char
long form all predictably adhere to known 64ths in my encoding, leaving only exactly the 8-char form as fields that could require shifting && special
interpret8ion.
Then the question for the long 64-char form will just be how many 64ths sub-frames I'll need to time photons (&& what to name them) which can hopefully leave a
healthy remainder of vastly Year extending characters. This 64 b64 character long d8 form will also resemble my default ckm8 encoding of which b64 characters
representing abbreV8d names of playable pieces reside in which of the 64 cells on the Chessboard (likely with filler 0 && 1 characters to represent empty
blacK && White squares visible on the board). Either of these 64 b64 character represent8ions (or any others) will represent a total of 384 bits. They also
each sort of describe an 8x8 m8rix of 6-bit base-64 characters (which themselves can uniquely identify a single cell of another m8rix). Remember that
d8 encodings actually have significant special processing since fields don't fully utilize their own bit precision, so treating 64 b64 chars as one long b64
number will be quite different from interpreting it as a meaningful d8. They'll have to sort && perform math very differently, even though they may appear
identical && interchangeable. It looks like the 384 bits of 64 b64 chars require 116 decimal digits, which seems to be a large number. Photons move at exactly
299,792,458 meters per second. I also need to know the smallest distance photons can be measured as having traveled. Approxim8ly travels 1 meter in 3.3ns or 3
billionths of a second. If frames are 60ths, jinx become 3,840ths, next becomes 245,760ths, next 15,728,640ths, next 1,006,632,960ths, && finally
64,424,509,440ths would be necessary. This looks like only 5 additional characters will be needed, but I'll just extend this to 8 for good measure, which
leaves 16,888,498,602,639,360ths of seconds as representable.

Having 8 chars in a normal d8 encoding && 8 more chars off the small end to be easily able to time photons traveling most measurable distances (although I
should still investig8 further whether tiny distances are used which will require additional tiny precision), this will leave 48 b64 chars to prefix
Year. If my current thinking on encoding d8 shifts is applied, then the existing range of approxim8ly 1,024 years (split down the middle by the Year 2000)
representable gets multiplied by 64 to the 48th power, resulting in a decimal number that still requires 91 decimal digits. Hopefully this immense number can
attempt to describe the age of our universe in years, in case doing so in such a fashion ever makes sense represent8ionally && comput8ionally.

I might be impressed if I or anyone else ever employs long-form d8s. They've gotta be overkill for representing recorded history, but at least they can when
default 8-char d8s fall short of representing B.C.E. && first century years entirely. I can't really imagine that my 8 software could still somehow be used
after the Year 2511. Maybe long-form d8s are obscure enough that their implement8ion should w8 for their need to surface, if it's ever reasonably going to.

D1F972c: I guess some perspective on efficiency of relative number bases is to look at decimal (0-9) && recognize that it (heh, also in decimal) represents
3.25 (3 && 1/4th) bits of precision per decimal digit. My base-64 represents 6. This means that b64 represent8ions of numerical values should always be just
over half the length of whatever b10 represent8ion would be required. In other words, b64 should always be *almost* twice as efficient as common decimal.

FSCK all uppercase looks like shouting a curse kinda,&& maybe can be exclaimed? Maybe FSCK needs a better name. I like rel8ing to Curses && playing on a
FUCK acronym (as usually the worst "curse") && like Unix FileSystemChecK `fsck` to make my text handling library FSCK, but it doesn't seem to flow or abbreV8
or even describe its purpose as well as most of my other names. Should the full name be pronouncing every letter as an initialism or more like a typical
acronym with "fisk"? I've been thinking about it as the latter, but this sort of goes against my convention of pronouncing every uppercase letter as a
separate syllable of the letter name. I hardly have any acronyms or initialisms throughout 8 yet so this one can be somewhat exceptional, if that serves well.
Maybe there's a better name though, that describes layers or text better, like coll8? Speaking of, maybe coll8 && narr8 should not double the consonants that
precede 8 like they do so far. Calling my Curses replacement col8 looks cleaner && of course I prefer alignment on 4-character boundaries over 5. Reads pretty
well either way. Hmm. I think I should review all my applic8ion names && see which ones seem better than FSCK. I keep trying to balance convenience with
consistency, brevity with predictability, intention with intuition, etc. so I'd like to get away from any exception acronyms && find a more descriptive name
for such a core component. It's more of a neologistic acronym of probably FsckSlayerCursesKing pronounced "fisk". Such a name is slightly descriptive for
anyone who knows of Curses. It's Unixy to make it a recursive acronym like FsckSavesCursesKarma or something similar. FsckSimplifiesCursesKnowingly or
FsckSupplantsCursesKaka? Maybe it should have an 8 in it, being so crucial, but not everything needs to.
Hmm. FsckSlapsCursesKaleidoscope. FsckShitCursesKaput?  FsckSavingCursesKernel. FsckSayingCursesKills . Bleh. These all seem pretty lame so far.
FsckStandsCursesKneels. That's pretty good. "Bow down, Curses!" Not actually profane && recursive && reasonably descriptive in expansion. Less confront8ional
might be FsckSimpleCursesKin. FsckSlayerCursesKing? Curses was sorta killed by ncurses && FSCK slays that too? These are getting a little better. I should
still probably compare with good 8 names too.
FsckSimpleCursesKthnxbye. FsckSavingCursesKludge. FsckSlashesCursesKing  .  FsckSaves CursesKingdom . FsckSmoothCursesKinky . FsckSavors CursesKiss  .
FsckSeniorCursesKid     . FsckSavageCursesKitten. FsckStove  CursesKettle.  FsckSneezeCursesKleenex . FsckSnipesCursesKnifes. FsckSews   CursesKnits .
FsckSeversCursesKnob    . FsckSings CursesKnocks. FsckSlices CursesKnots .  FsckSlips CursesKudos   . FsckStagesCursesKu    . FsckSaves  CursesKills .
FsckSuperiorCursesKnows . FsckStoringCursesKnowledge. FsckSays CursesKnowingly.FsckStole   CursesKeys  . FsckSmashesCursesKeyboard . FsckStopsCursesKaka.
I'm pretty sure that FsckStandsCursesKneels is the best FSCK so far. FSCK is only honorarily an acronym, only known by Unix geeks, && has no 8 in it. I'm
not sure if that middle one is an asset or detriment, but the first && last seem subpar for inclusion in 8. Will only Unix geeks use FSCK anyway?
Hard to say, but probably interface to textual layers will remain esoteric. FsckSlayerCursesKing (like MikeAdams KingSlayer =) has "layer" in it too.
Since the actual `fsck` command is unrel8d, maybe another acronym with C && 8 can be found to be better. The joke of FSCK being like FUCK which is the worst
curse for replacing Curses with may not be so worthwhile. Maybe it could instead be FUC8, pronounced like "fuck it"? Or SUC8 "suck it" a little cleaner?
Ooh. COL8? If C is for Curses, it's not going to be a recursive acronym. =( Otherwise, kinda cool. CursesOnLayer8? COL8 also suggests COLors && COLumns
like c8 too. Maybe better not an acronym && just col8? Codename: FSCK!

8term, 8scrn, && 8sh should be able to detect all the cursor movement in existing captive interfaces like gst123, to reformat && color. Maybe remap
unused keys to detected as available functions with layers of some HUD. A lot of those potential FSCK expansions seem pretty descriptive && funny && it
wouldn't be a bad idea to reference `fsck` at a low level if ckm8 is going to be an important Chess offering utilizing the same abbreV8ion.col8 externally &&
FSCK internally. =) Maybe programmers learning the internals will be reasonably more likely to also be interested in ckm8 too, so that's good synergy to just
let it have both names (&& maybe also saddled with a lot of valid acronym expansions too, until they can be pared down to top8 then best or whatever).

So c8 is the COmmand-Line inCarn8ion of the COLumnar COLoriz8or cut that Converts col8 (FSCK) layers between existing && new Commands. Cool! ;)

Consider releasing 8 anonymously or just as 8Pi on I2P. I've imagined that, if a significant portion of 8 can be implemented, it will stratify the thinking &&
computing abilities of those it reaches first. This is probably mistaken && even much of 8 running will merely seem interesting but not revolutionary to
anyone introduced to it. Developing to the point of crE8ing a collabor8ive universe simul8ion && social stratific8ion at all resembling SnowCrash are unlikely.

collabor8 should default to personal cursors that can target any col8 layers of any shared text, while `8scrn -x`-like behavior should allow direct sharing of
a common cursor, for when that is desirable too. Of course gradu8 sliders, m8rix unit selection, etc. will require multiple interacting mouse-like pointers in
addition to initial primarily textual ones.

I don't know if I should go by some handle other than Pip. 8pI is pronunC8ion consistent. In addition to eventually graphically representing words as curv8s,
summs, averages, d8s, etc. they should also graph relative frequency of character, set or word within the open text, some configurable range, just on screen,
on the current line, in the current sentence, phrase, etc. as options that may also become significant to inform the input virtual keyboard sizes && other
things. Sentences will be able to be graphed && pseudo-navig8d through time when words are sequentially visited as d8s. Words will shoot all over the available
d8 line. Maybe for words longer than 8 characters, then the standard YMDz hmsf extends on into the smaller 64th characters toward photon timing, eventually
filling all 8 of those before starting to then grow off the left side of dramatically broadening the potential computed year. This will probably only happen
for the very largest && most ridiculous seeming words. Then again, it'll be easy to take any text && substitute . for any found punctu8ion && _ for any
space && whatever is desirable for anything else found. I hope some experts can be eventually enlisted to assist with good mappings for characters I've been
too isol8d from by whatever time when that might be feasible. I'm sure studying Unicode again && applying some Greek, Hebrew, Kana, etc. will help me do the
best I can in suggestive prepar8ion. Letters && words are distinct colors, UnitedSt8s, etc. too. 8 should become synesthesia software.

It appears 8 may need to support 2 primary f8 font sizes: old VGA ones that are exactly 8 pixels wide && FreeType 8pt fonts that look to be slightly larger;
Maybe making the 8-pixel wide fonts out of 3D cubes will let them size match with larger scalable fonts (or maybe 7pt or 7.5pt or whatever) but then scale
preserving the original respective bitmap or smooth scalability of the selected font. 8 aims to support immeD8 bitmap font editability but scalable might
recommend FontForge for the furthering of that aspect. Similarly, it will probably be well after E88 before 8 seems likely to compete with Blender, even though
many interface ideas can hopefully transfer && improve mutually.

Start GUIs with 2D SDL Sprite objects instead of attempting everything in 3D from the outset. Supporting either option will be valuable && they'll probably
exhibit distinct performance characteristics recommending them for differing purposes.

I've longed for development breakthroughs to be attained once enough of 8 is made sufficiently approachable, but maybe they won't happen anywhere near as
profoundly as I had hoped. Visually conveying bits, colors, fonts, values, etc. in new conventions will at least please me. I aspire to be consistently pleased
with the progress I've made on 8.

D1SJ93G:So on one hand, I'm happy that I've just gotten my old med.f0nt loaded && displaying text via SDL Sprite draws but I'm also feeling that these old VGA
text fonts without scalability or smoothing are lame && bogus nostalgia compared to support for smooth scaling && Unicode. I'm gonna have to make 8 compete
with FontForge to support immeD8 editability of that kind of text though. Then again, I gotta start somewhere && nostalgia will at least be pleasant for me.

D1TMtkC:So there's a lot I'm thinking of wanting to do with 8, but also worry that 8 is TMI or 2MuchoIn4m8ion. Want to make f8 (eventually V8 for f80p f0ntpal8
naturally editable both) start with named color-code parameter indexing old VGA order first but permitting reshuffling thereafter && gener8 oper8ing on
whatever small set of definitions to propag8 to named (but configurably shifted) larger sets. Detecting non-8 shell && environment should be able to still do
reasonable things when given extraneous parameters without analog within the older limit8ions. Maybe dimensions should be 1280x800 or 1912x1072 && probably not
just some centered 1024**2. I primarily want both a 160x50 text area && a natural 8x8 ckm8 board square. Want to convert easily between .psf && .f0nt also,
even though the latter should be extensible into Unicode as easily as I can enable. Same with old simultaneously displayable palette && font limits as being
supported to the extent feasible.

D1U8bfj:It seems 8 should sorta be modal like vim in general with F Foreground color, f f0nt, B Background color, etc. as layers && modes of selection &&
context for V8 set of pal8 or f0nt names. Maybe editing them should be a mode too that commandeers FfB fields for nested meta interface. Maybe P for Palette or
C for Color are better or good initial aliases. Running neg8 on colors could auto-swap Fore && Back,or on f0nt could invert F&&B pixels,having the same effect.

D24Ddbb:Not worrying as much about demonstr8ion or impact since ideas are feeling less urgent. So then what do I want most? I guess I'm wanting less pressure
to prove 8 as this grandiose ontology for public consumption && to refocus on just whatever is most useful or pretty or compelling to me alone. Then maybe l8r
I can try to capitalize on whatever benefits 8 can eventually afford me after publishing it.
Ok, so my 2du might deserve upd8ing here like:
  0) start Octology::f8.pm with objects && CLI2cnv btwn .psf&&.f0nt formats as well as .2pal8 files comparing ways to gener8 .2pal8 && .8pal8 from basic .pal8
  1) start gener8 abbreV8ing my .f0nt && .2pal8 names (with hints) && extend top8 to 8top8
  2) get my 8top8 .f0nt files to render as SDLx::Sprite objects first, then made of 3D cube virtual pixels second
  3) get my 8top8 color names && .pal8 files abbreV8d && easily mappable to above .f0nt characters
  4) port Curses::Simp to Octology::col8.pm to align layers of text, font, && colors, then elabor8 on c8 to columnize, cut, && color col8 text on the cmd-line
  5) start 8sh running shell commands && displaying scrolling colorful text
  6) port   Time::PT   to Octology::d8.pm (including classes, cmd-line Utls, ptok as d8ok, bdyz, ptg, etc.)
  7) flesh out c8 to wrap most Unix ("Pignux"?) commands in colorful ways that detect zsh or fledgling 8sh && flesh out interactive f8 to edit .f0nt && .pal8
Still not worrying too much about 8term or 8scrn at first would be best to limit my scope && the amount of preliminary research required. Then:
  8) make coordin8, str8, gradu8, && m8rix (as more graphical widgets) making inherent simultaneous binary, linear, 2D, && 3D perspectives on d8a values
  9) make tr8s && st8s for (or from) all above d8a objects
  A) research useful d8a sets && gener8 cards,Chess,St8s,etc. in m8rices
  B) become able to either run screen,zsh,&&vim in 8 or mimic them extensively
  C) flesh out interactive d8 gradu8d str8s with stacking tokens or spans && implement long-form to import existing timed event && time-line formats
  D) make w8 with cmd-line && graphical forms to manipul8 all standard units
  E) make r8 for any d8a set &&                                      especially prioritiz8ion
  F) make m8 for new d8a sets with rel8ions && to better visualize abbreV8ions, prioritiz8ions, etc.
The premise of 8 && f8 may be flawed. My fonts && palettes are already beautiful, so obviously only making old limited bitmapped .f0nt d8a available is sorely
inadequ8 && FontForge must be mimicked for real scalable Unicode control to be provided. Maybe 8 eventually is so ambitious but can start humbly with more
nostalgia && ease of coloring && font inclusion factor. Then again, maybe novel new ways of just expanding bitmaps can also approxim8 scalable shapes. I don't
know nearly enough about those or Unicode for that matter. What am I thinking? So study them or catch up on them l8r! ;)
Apparently Pig cannot be kosher, Gnu can be, and penguins (Tux) cannot be, so Pignux would be a treif breaded kosher sandwich, not even close to kosher-style?

D258WDB:Anticip8ing 8 makes me concerned that normal memory d8a (&& useful as ephermeral?) that used to deterior8 will be much easier for me to catalog.
Still think it'd be pretty slick to run an 8sh command with & to background it then show scrolling in background colors as a good default behavior option. =)

D2HAX0R passed a bit ago && I thought I should try to do something. c8 formatting aguu with colored alignment should be simple && sweet. Livened routine. =)
I'm imagining ways to initE8 neophytes to 8 through entry points into useful explor8ions. I want to show that customiz8ion of any visible f0nt, color, pal8,
tyl, etc. can be personal && efficient, mnemonic, && hopefully also Perlishly DWIM intuitive. I imagine a simple explan8ion just starting from V8 && explaining
everything rL8ive to summariz8ion && then alter8ion (via filtr8ion). Another probably more complic8d level can start from a basic default VGA font && explain
old text modes with persisting limit8ions based on their standards, then convey the intentional growability of 8 f0nt && pal8 formats (which admittedly have
their own sometimes similarly conspicuous limit8ions based on 8 constrained dimensions). Maybe it'd be useful to attempt to contrast the limit8ions &&
respective shortcomings of my approaches compared with standards. Maybe other people could (or should, for objectivity reasons) do that once I publish?
I should probably perform the best such comparisons I can muster while blatantly acknowledging necessary bias. Maybe levels could be described as user stories:
  0)  8 - infinite && binary 3D anim8d
  1) V8 - anything abbreV8s contextually
  2) f8 - how they have had to be && can be with 8
  3) d8 - dates && time-lines are gr8 - start with d8ok raD8ing && text ticking with altern8ing && mini conversions to assoC8 colors with fields && granularity
  4) m8 - anything    rel8s contextually
  5) r8 - anything   is r8d on tr8s
  6) w8 - any V8 set  rel8s with standards
  7) c8 - cut your way into Pignux comprehension - taking aliasing && filtr8ion into the configurably col8 regex && altern8ing logical conclusions domain

USt8s originally planned to be ordered in A..Za..x should maybe have common uppercase Q && lowercase q character omitted instead of y && z to ease memorability
of alloc8ion of remainder names with entirely obscure V8s.

Maybe a demonstr8ion of just Countries, USt8s, && cards among m8rix && texts, synesthetic with color && sound would convey a lot with a little?

Maybe h8 shouldn't even be an option in 8.

D3P9aPe:So V8 as a general-purpose abbreviation mechanism naturally serves for aliasing purposes in a way abstracted from any particular command shell so that
V8s can be utilized universally. V8 is also a natural place for summariz8ion && elabor8ion. It's a form of command encapsul8ion. The filtr8ion ability allows
for augment8ion of command outputs yielding format customiz8ion && maybe most distinctively coloriz8ion. V8 should allow anything to be abbreV8d meaningfully.

D5NDuuF:So thinking about demonstr8ions of 8 starting with "Can you learn 8 things?" as a common intro. Maybe it should be an encouraging st8ment instead: "You
can learn 8 things." Then lesson zero should start: "V8 stands for abbreV8ion and is the most important one. It will become your key to abbreV8ing anything in
your universe. It will also enable you to manipul8 anything you can name, but let's just focus on str8forward abbreV8ions for now." Then elabor8 on b64 && V8
basics. Lesson one should start: "ROYGCBMP" as a broad brush to start V8ing a basic rainbow pal8 as the top 8 most important general color categories. Explain
White && blacK as outside of the rainbow. Explain uppercase bright, lowercase dark. Explain RGB && CMYK. Explain Orange legacy as dark yellow && Purple as new
dark magenta. Then extend into 8pal8 as top 64 named colors (probably including Indigo [under B], && Violet [under M]). Explain b64 RGB as basis for actual
maps then other formats up to 2.4 million distinct colors of CIE 1931 XYZ color space to maybe 7 or 10 million discernable by the human eye according to
ColorMatters.Com and Wikipedia. Lesson two probably for d8 with "YMDzhmsf". Explain that each of these is a V8 that can be expanded and identifies d8 fields
then explain d8ok etc.. A l8r lesson should elabor8 on V8s which perform content alter8ion (filtr8ion) to either slim down or extend the thing being V8d. Then
maybe w8,m8,r8, && ckm8?

Basic V8s should already start with a domain (context, zone, maybe an 8 applic8ion name, or maybe some hierarchy of all these?) which facilit8s autom8d
disambigU8ion then advanced V8 lesson shows m8 method for selecting a particular V8 path when domain can't be discerned. Maybe w8 should almost always V8
weight but can also easily be wait within some scheduling domain and can be an intended V8 override via visual m8 path selection. Other homonyms might yield
better examples.
Remember to be flexible enough to still support decimal numbers and counts of things as intuitively as I can too. Even though Octology strongly prefers 8 && 64
of anything, 10 && 100 should still also be easily viable, just discouraged slightly. Document8ion has been w8ing 4 crystalliz8ion largely B4 implement8ion.
NYSE is probably an additional important domain for V8. Nice to emphacize personal domains for V8 maps like Ss Sony samsung electronics.
Context should usually distinguish SouthernCalifornia from SantaCruz from SoulCalibur from StephenColbert && OS's OS OS. SoCal && SouCali could each still
succintly V8 both but they imply the former && latter. It may be important for 8sh to have a clear alias domain within V8 which knows how to expand them
recursively until maybe falling out to a desired executable of the same name.
Maybe demonstr8ing just whatever is most useful behaviorally to me && whatever initial audience I plan on is what should remain. Catching up && staying caught
up on GMail && FcBk should precede any release or demonstr8ion to anyone other than myself.

Maybe goal d8 on which 8 should be shared is F88 when I'll be 38? I should determine && solidify a goal feature set && milestones to meet before sharing with
Maga before developer friends.

I recognize that I've greedily gobbled up nearly every possible use of 8 exclusively for myself, although I thoroughly intend to eventually release collabor8
&& then deleg8 authority over different applic8ions out to others who come up with better altern8ives to my initial explor8ions. I'm still probably being a
control-freak about every 8 though. Hopefully that's not such a bad offense since it's kinda necessary for me to make 8 worthwhile in the first place.

Being categorized as disabled means that hardly anyone expects anything from me. Maybe collabor8 should be designed to be compassion8 to users && allow for
anonymity through different means && auto deleg8ion so that users are deterred from holding unmeetable expect8ions. No easy task. Some expect8ions should be
justifiable && held as reasonable to have met.
D5Q9vTC:Catherine z8a-Jones apparently has Bipolar too and I wish her well with it. BeastieBoys RhyminAndStealin mentions pieces of 8 which I should look into
as Octology money. ckm8 should have 32 characters with names matching piece abbreV8ions similar to Ubuntu release code names and eventually f8l should make
them fight. Parsec88 would also be nice. TMBG said "Sure as you can't steer a train, you can't change your f8." d8 should have dumbell gesture for ranges.
Pretty sure I should GMail first but then not sure if I should extend pt into d8 next or gener8 pal8 color names as first domain then grow into 8sh && viii or
just skip to ckm8.
If I do make c8 && l it might be nice to eventually apply the same principles to web CSS && HTML through similar filtr8ion that can be V8d. Maybe adopting
1280x800 as my only initially supported resolution is an acceptable limit8ion to begin but would of course benefit from ability to change maybe with scaling.

Normal Chess not8ion has rows starting with 1 on the bottom with White pieces and counting up to 8 at the top. My default m8rix linear indexing will likely
start at the top left counting right then down the rows but leaving White at the bottom. Maybe ckm8 should index up from lower-left instead.
Maybe it's good to coin a new word: "Eightbow" which means ROYGCBMP although it might just be the default order for any pal8 && better referred to that way.

D5RIIHo:Considering inferiority, maybe pt just stays more elegant than d8 with some inserted mainly static zone. f8 is predictably worse than GnomTerm fonts
but is fun for nostalgia and immeD8 editability might be a demonstrable power at least someone besides me will consider worth wielding. pal8 seems slicker than
altern8ives. V8 is probably the crux.
zsh && vim are already rad && huge so harsh to duplic8. Interactive gradu8 && d8 probably w8 until l8r. Probably shouldn't skip to ckm8 without some form of
gradu8 && m8rix first. Need command interface to gener8 && V8 specifying domains.
Color formats CMYK RGB can get pronunC8ion like "See Mike Rugby." Visual V8 will need m8 to map domain hierarchies. The V8 command needs a good d8a format too.
Uppercase V8s tend to be whiter, brighter, bigger, or more popular while lowercase tends toward blacker, darker, smaller, or less popular. My b64 indices are a
critically central exception where uppercase letters mean lower values and lowercase means higher. Octology will probably mostly be considered Cowboy Coding
(at least until collabor8 enables sharing). Heh, 8b8a as the name for any beta test release. 8 can be hypnotically beautiful, requiring p8ience but I should
still eventually explore most of the above.
Maybe similar to SteveKrug's Don'tMakeMeThink, Octology says MakeThinkingWorthIt (make things intuitive && adequ8ly reward only actually necessary thinking).
On /. today tepples wrote that consoles beat PCs at fighting, party, && cooper8ive platformer games so maybe I could eventually focus there to serve the void?
D62FEWN:So I think ckm8 pieces might be better RIBQKSTO PAWNCDEF which would allow all characters of PAWN V8 names && aligns other 4 characters with b64
indices for White on the bottom if zeroing lower-left corner counting right then up (or if inverting top down).
ckm8 should support traditional not8ion or my preferred Octology varE8ion or arbitrary intermeD8 mappings && cell indexing as well as personally variable
corner && direction orient8ions. Breaking so much entrenched tradition feels brash but hopefully approprE8 for experiment8ion && explor8ion purposes.
Additionally, genders are probably most predictably evened out by mostly altern8ing according to initially underlying checkerboard square color (so White
pieces starting on White squares && black pieces starting on black squares tend to be females with those remaining pieces of a particular side's color that
begin on opposite colored squares tending to be male).
This would somewhat intuitively intersperse expected genders along with a strengthened assoC8ion between particular pieces with their origin square's color
rL8ive to their side's color. I think there should be room for transgendered piece characters && names, even though I'm not initially designing any specific
ones to be categorized distinctly from male or female keyed to their side && start colors (just for binary clarity). It used to be nice to recognize that most
pawns would be promoted to Queens && so might be predicted to also likely have female genders to oppose the King's expected maleness (although this whole
exercise is somewhat silly being based on assumptions && gender logic which already challenge the more likely expect8ion that all pieces but Queens are male
without consider8ion for inconsequential genders of potentially or actually promoted pawns). This approach seems even cooler though since it intentionally
acknowledges female bishops, knights, && rooks. I guess this approach still expresses gender bias binarily outward from male Kings && female Queens, but still
challenges assumptions somewhat && has some cool synergy like side's bishop's genders govern square colors they're bound to. Aligning with b64 indices is
compacted nicely with the final 4 being the next V8s available && feels much more 8-centric than aligning with antiqu8d Chess file letters. For every option
to support older not8ions or starting quadrants && directions, intentional transl8ions will be needed to encourage various participants with differing settings
to be able to communic8 common game progress with each other.
D63BKe5:So breaking just about every established Chess convention, I think my default indexing like video memory from upper left going right then down is best
for my ckm8 ordering also && starting with White at the top (swapping King && Queen positions to preserve correct starting color squares). Eventually neg8 can
flip origins of axes or pieces starting sides as desired. This will loc8 uppercase White pieces closer to uppercase lower indices && bottom black with higher.
D67Arig:Might be good to also try to V8 top 64 most popular UnitedSt8sian or international airport codes.
D68JWOd:Regarding UnitedSt8s, maybe Texas should be X && Arizona should be Z && the upper && lowercase letters to not use should be Q. UnitedSt8s lowercased
names letter frequency follows:

z ... so yeah, no Q, only one J && Z for newJersey && ariZona. Might need to experiment with potential alloc8ions of V8s to still be somewhat intuitive.
D6AAar6:So I think I need to figure out a few places in Octology to get started coding. Probably rereading everything above && taking more summarized notes of
most conclusive plans with prioritized altern8s then try to focus just on classic command-line stuff first (probably via col8) then growing into captive
interfaces that are still utilizing the text modes of traditional terminals before getting into fully graphical SDL versions. Then again, maybe I should return
to text-mode l8r && just go for some fun 8sh && f8 work to start. Hmm. Maybe most systematic would be all forms of d8 && d8ok. Probably thorough distill8ion &&
summariz8ion before any real coding. Maybe I should start with V8's d8a format && interfaces. Maybe should plan to get into f8l using SCV stick. Start with
just basic White versus blacK shapes to King versus Queen before expanding to RIBP pieces
then distinct total 32 named characters:               <White    black> ribkqsto                  pawncdef ... upd8d ckm8 not8ion using linear b64 indexing

What I need to do most is audit GMail && FcBk && start catching up there before learning how && what to code again. Start from tomorrow && work backwards!
Maybe StevenSnowden && PhilipPhalanx instead? RosettaRoost? Swap Ephraim && edward? Maybe an entire altern8 piece set of names with genders && KQ flipping?
So making some good progress backwards through GMails. Nobody seems to be expecting anything significant from me && I've grown accustomed to expecting
essentially nothing from myself either, but that's shifting to where I'm starting to expect myself to actually start coding useful components of Octology!
I think I should study timezones and crE8 CLI d8 then c8 then f8. I've had some ideas of mapping SDL button configur8ions to my joysticks && combining any
input that I'd want to align with audio or video playback, maybe then rel8ing input events with discernable similarly timed segments of existing media to allow
for expressive remixing in potentially astonishing ways (after sufficient input assoC8ion training).
D6O8sx4:Might be neat to have MCEsher as Chessboard pattern options. Might also be better with White on bottom as more compatible default. Initially enabling
neg8 to flip axes, White side, and piece ordering direction should be pretty str8forward but use that to decide on best default before sharing.
Maybe Danny's dismissal recommends minimal further sharing until a lot can be developed, so I should just figure out whatever I like most.
D97MB2rP:Thinking of initial SDL graphics-based new text mode (starting 8term), default should likely be 160x50 8x16 chars at 1280x800 (attempting full-screen
on Chun&&Taki) but capable of scaling that basis 8:5 resolution up by 1.5 to stretch into 1920x1200, then options for aligning,centering,or further scaling
(with own options for preserving aspect r8io) down to 1080p (likely centered 1728x1080 maybe black letterboxed on sides, or somewhat less if no full-screen);
There should basically be 3 window resize functions:0)scale without restraint 1)scale preserving aspect 2)alter textual dimensions&&basis resolution by chars;
Eventually better to learn && adopt some density(&&resolution?)-independent-pixel mechanism to extend far beyond basis 1280x800 in available app resolution;
Maybe eventually also supporting scalable Unicode fonts will provide a natural place to become more broadly resolution independent by some effective means;
Also prepare for screen(resolution&&aspect) rot8ion scenarios (2407+VaporX or GalaxyS4); Once I have control of such a text mode, thinking of maybe having
demonstr8 utilize coll8 event scripts to show my d8 timed typing inputs to anim8 my textual (&& interactive sometimes graphical?) descriptions of:
  0) b8 as Basetransl8 (BaseCnv) in Octology introducing b64 as found8ion for most following 8 encoding forms
  1) V8 as integr8d way to context-sensitively abbreviate anything (showing 8 Utl names expanded && eventually prose with prediction)
  2) f8 as f80p as f0nt && pal8's 8bow && principles
  3) d8 format principles && d8ok styles
  4) m8 && graph theory
  5) r8 for universal dynamic valU8ion
  6) c8   s8    l   g     etc.cmdline applic8ions
  7) 8trm 8scrn 8sh viii  etc.captive applic8ions
  8) ckm8 p8    f8l SSN8  etc.gaming  applic8ions, sk8 gM8ria intoxic8 simul8
Need gradu8 && m8rix to visually convey b8 first as most logical numerical basis for all 8 apps. Need m8 for visual V8 next. coll8 scripts should become
replayable records, live editable, && exportable to non-interactive video in order to maximally educ8 the interested world about Octology. Would be cool to
enable each l8r script to precede themselves with progressively faster fast-motion replays of earlier scripts as dynamically reconfigurable refresher courses.
Interactive b8 (maybe diverging from coll8 script) can offer way to redefine the fundamental b64 map's unique characters through command or dialog, although
maybe doing so will have unintended side-effects && is better discouraged or sandboxed or easily overrideable with default? Just as graphical b8 should convey
simultaneous multi-view of binary bit values alongside 1D or 2D spectrum primary represent8ion, r8 should play with words (or any tokens mapping to b64) with
their 8 inherited numbers as median,mean,meridian,sum,product,d8,etc. like gematria highlighting text as numbers should be done && fun (when possible). Maybe
make gM8ria game that reinforces assoC8ions between rel8d represent8ions of numbers, text, && values showing emerging new rel8ionships to math && oper8ions.
Playing MvC2 with Jer, thinking f8l should totally offer recent configur8ions for teams && assist types as well as show mini assist anim8ions when selecting.
Primarily text-mode of viii can optionally overlay higher perspective showing whole file syntax highlighted chars as pixels && maybe similar also eventually
available in increasingly colorful 8term with bird's-eye perspective on scrollback as altern8ive to standard scrollbar provided hidden like gnome-terminal.
Maybe a nestable version available further to mo (my more/most) as just a common capability of interacting with more representative overview contexts widely.
Sounds like a m8 inheritance hierarchy or n8 set of nesting st8s can provide recomposition mechanism for which potential scroll overlays are where && how.
Overlay would primarily obscure the right-most 20 character columns (out of 160) so 1/8th (of typically least useful) lost is a good bit wider && more
intrusive its presence would be than more typical non-representative scrollbar widgets. Options for just foreground color, background color if space char,
back if sufficiently small char, double height to accurately reflect zoomed char aspect r8ios 1:2, render beyond text rather than over it (&& type of resize?).
Should probably highlight visible view && maybe nest further in from 1 or 2 char wide classic scrollbar or less than a char indic8or like gnome-terminal.
Any new wrapper commands should default to expecting traditional terminal with compatible options, but try to detect enhanced 8term for added abilities.
Hopefully at some point 8term will become such an expressive platform for colorful manipul8ion that a lot of dynamic features unique to it can flourish.
Still distill8 or some similar tool should know how to filter away any unsupported extensions to keep facilit8ing classically usable compatibility modes.
Rather than File::Temp for conveying @ARGV to potential c8 following, possibly better to just exchange explicitly in $TMP(DIR|PREFIX) or /tmp/ with:
  c8prearg-`d8` if!-e;
Maybe give a generic suffix like .tmp or extension corresponding to contained d8a interchange format or both if that makes sense. Should probably also dash in
another 8 random b64 chars after d8 in case 2 calls happen the same frame && files should be renamed with dashed finished d8 field to closest match backwards
among finished d8 values within c8 (maybe needing to examine multiple very recent finishers to determine best match) then unlinking selected tempfile.
Oper8ions should be prioritized closest to last && first for renaming versus expediently loading. Add $d8->upd8_now() to repopul8 fields with l8st time d8a.
Maybe add exportable d8() which modularizes existing command-line behavior for slight procedural support like b8::b64(); Maybe attempting to become somewhat
reliant on /tmp/ files for configur8ion && argument exchange is ill-advised if a better altern8ive through RAM presents itself.
Name might better be: /tmp/c8prearg-`d8`-fnsh-$earlier_start_d8-strt-$earlier_random_8_b64_chars-rndm.tmp.(xml|json|pl|ls|$better_extension_name)
falling back on File::Temp (which goes where else than cwd?) if /tmp/ fails.
D99MJj1R:Maybe V8 should unify a common set of colors && conversions for b8,d8,c8,f8,&& pal8 as all having deep dependence on color concept that's betr shared.
b8 should probably be right-justified BigFloat /^-?[0-9A-Za-z._]+(:[0-9A-Za-z._]+)?$/ with optional commas surrounding b64{4} out from :.
Make coma, b64, d8, etc. accept logical STDIN options (when non-interactive) to accept being piped into. Make b8::(expand|compress)_span just strings.
D9GMFUrc:Lagging on starting b8. Remembered that prevailing wisdom in InfoVis recommends not using color but hoping 8bow can change that && become intuitive.
Maybe introduce 8 colored potentially 8-character b64 formats: b8,frac,d8,Frame,RGB,RRGGBBAA,CCMMYYKK,IPv4(YYGGCCBB?) (maybe combine RGBs && add another?)
The "reasonable" person adapts themself to the world, thus Octology is a result of my unreasonableness? Assuming it gets considered as "progress" by others?
I wonder how much 8 will just seem obvious after it has been sufficiently demonstr8d. Not sure if RRGGBBAA or CCMMYYKK should be 8 or 12 bits per chan. IPv4=8.
8term bg should be able to Alpha to desktop like GnomTerm. b8 POD should explain "low $letr" spoken prefix && FUjy BMXit AKUeoy 5AFKPUZejoty 48CGKOSWaeimquy as

DC9LN0nH:8 introduction sort of bootstrapping thoughts - V8 is the key abbreV8ion. It allows most things to be easily abbreV8d down to a single character,
when advantageous. It oper8s in contexts, which are maybe orthogonal to domains && aliases && other critical categoriz8ions? There should be reasonably good
delinE8ion between top level cats because each seems to complic8 unnecessarily. Some V8s are actually much gr8r than mere abbreV8ions. They can perform
complex filtr8ion, reformul8ion, && coloriz8ion like a super abbreV8ion. V8 can show a Base64 or b64 context mapping to introduce b8 with reverse colors &&
almost double efficiency over decimal. b8 becomes the basis for d8, f8, && ckm8 field represent8ion. c8 then builds on pal8 to show col8 layers. Maybe c8 will
need either Curses::Simp or a new 8term to render. Then maybe graph theory with m8. Then r8 seems basic. A l8 scheduler could build on d8. Top8:[Vbdfcmrl]8
DCTLIF8W:8 == 8+0 == 8*1 == 8**1 == 1+7 == 2**3 == 2*4 == 3+5 (PrimeFiboNumbz) && 64 == 8**2 == 2**6 as most crucial numerical rel8ionships between 0..8;

Should systematize dealing with fragility, identifying constructivist account of essential components that are proven most stable && reliable to be based upon;
Having such similarity between Ryu && Ken recommends similar approach to new Uka (or Gou?) vs. Aku as intentional way to maximize likelihood that at least 1
comparable machine will keep running with plenty of spare parts whenever something breaks that finally can no longer be replaced by purchase. There's also a
stability benefit to juxtaposed variety in triangul8ing on problems && determining respective advantage among category parts; Even though his AsusM4A79TDeluxe
remains online somewhat, it's looking a bit scarce for sale in stock after about 3.5 years. Might be still affordable much better newer options by now.
I have this weird sense of dread that every machine is approaching a catastrophic failure that can no longer be further remedied. I guess at that point
salvaging any parts && discarding (&& fully replacing) whatever becomes unrecoverable. I now have 1 unstable desktop && 2 stable laptops. I should get screens
&& drives to get all 3 desktops stable along with laptops before seriously constructing new Uka (or Mit as distinct from Aku?) or extending to another Fujitsu
convertible tablet like Chun. Get everybody humming with good equipment before expanding much further. Consider SamsungGalaxyNote8.0;
For 8 software, start with 8:5 1280x800 triple mode resolution that insets 640x400 SVGA && 320x200 Mode13h all in half rel8ionships; Extend to 16:9 1920x1080
with just 3x3 640x360 insets; Then support maybe 1:1 1600x1600 square mode that might not need insets; Then have software accept any of those aspects &&
orient8ions && allow any resolution to become virtual && smooth scaled (probably OpenGL textured) to become any desired dimensions of window or fullscreen;
Generalize common input interfaces for applic8ions to have ability to constrain to any inset level && discrete or smooth expected zooms with command-line,
Curses captive keyboard, Tk keyboard, mouse, or single-touch, SDL keyboard, mouse, single-touch, or joystick, Android multi-touch, multi-user && cursors;
SamsungTV does:640x480x60,720x480x59.9,1920x1080ix60 should become PS2 only extreme last-resort backup display; applic8ion option to centralize menus && tools;
Dell2407WFP   :640x480x60,720x400x70.1,1920x1200x60  should become Ken's main display  or Chun or Taki's secondary; pair up displays && machines;
2x  24"1080P  :                        1920x2160x60  should become Ryu's same displays or PS3  && experiment with VMs or different drives && distros
TV 40+"1080P  :                        1920x1080x120+should become Aku's main display  or PS4  .. then try 2xTV && 4x24" then give SamsungTV away && store Dell
support f0nt 9x18, 16x32, 64x128, && 256x512 which can combine to inform scalable font at some point; Probably leave `ls` alone as standard but wrap basic with
ls8 which then gets more detailed with lsd8 as also just l; let lsd8 long flow whole detailed pack into super columns like default on just names does;
E1ILCApe:d8 lines should show multi-views && be able to constrain to text-mode dimensions or scale to those as desired when using virtual or exact higher-res
pixel dimensions; f8 might want to begin with schism Ctrl|ShftF12; JoyAudio:Jah-man laying down mainly joystick performances of any existing audio or video.
Should eventually be awesome AI that reads everything about audio matching smartly to every detectable varE8ion in input playing patterns. Have device
visibility as maybe exagger8d charicature with DDR GuitarHero style scrollers. Make it like the best tracking software but optimized around detecting portions
or influences within existing audio pairing up with joystick events. Have training, tuning, && performing modes. The latter should easily navig8 dur8ion lines
to lay down background beats as patterns which you then get the song's length of time to perform the same or different based on your best most tuned l8st
training d8a for that track. It should be easy to organize instrument collections from anything heard well enough to be auto-trained if not explicitly manual;
The best d8a for training should initially be anything that has some form of synchronized video which can be analyzed perpendicularly && can assist gr8ly as
coordin8d windows; Intent is to intuitively isol8 every processed instrument and make them readily available for anticip8d or meticulous elabor8ive per4mance;
Performance mode might need to help your timing or dampen improvis8ion if desired goal is audible similarity to original throughout dur8ion of track;
E1JLBZxi:p8 like p47 scrolling shooter should play if you zoom in on DDR button bars; synchronizing the obstacles && colors with the buttons && music is key;
will probably require pre-execution analysis in order to make difficulty level at all consistent; ship controls should start as just keyboard && joystick maybe
adding some mouse && touch forms l8r. If a song is pretty well trained with existing joystick buttons on major sonic events && thus rL8ively consistent
obstacle && difficulty progression, it'd be cool to have other person improvising buttons to sounds throughout the song while keyboard p8 player can surf
through potentially pretty customized new territory while leaving a lot of familiarity with what sounds && hurdles are generally available about when;
Should tap into pulseaudio && gstreamer visualiz8ions to just gener8 && play p8 tripz from existing tracks without needing joy buttons or pre-analysis;
When joy events are aligned to a track by dur8ion,those should cause much more dramatic reactions as deserving of extra personal attention. The basic audio
should form the basis on which various new custom manual or autom8d layers of events can be added && used to trigger timed anim8ions or obstacle gener8ions;
Maybe JoyAudio (even though already nicely 8 characters) is cooler as reson8,syncop8,orchestr8 or another better name? Better to not require joystick either;
p8 should have ckm8 characters as shmup pilots with class abilities fighting for respective crowns && prospective promotion; Should also have cool co-op mode;
elabor8 help tool could color highlight all sorts of context && could expound upon what every tool or process does or can do; as much4my ref as assist otherz;
Remember to binary-search triangul8 in on best solutions; Maybe the goal of my AI is for us both to teach each other && learn, in ckm8, language, && code;
Contempl8ing valU8 as my new personal inventory tracking system; Thoroughly catalog all that I own in this apartment, describing reasons to keep or replace;
E1KLArl6: HTTP://PGBovine.Net/what-is-computer-science.htm PhilipGuo has rather useful 4-word definition of CS: Efficiently Implementing Autom8d Abstractions;
It seems my Octology approach to abstracting away detail is to maximize efficiency of represent8ion && abbreV8ion down to single characters identifying
distinct context-sensitive fields throughout any implement8ion. Typical autom8ion might w8 for gener8 to prove the basis for popul8ing desired contexts;
"Computer Science is about building clean abstract models (abstractions) of messy, noisy, real-world objects or phenomena. As Computer Scientists, we must

E29LC6ac: Maybe an Octology introduction can be available through ckm8, mainly intended to be my own personal explanatory account of all development decisions
made && why but hopefully thorough enough to be useful if other people ever show interest. I think I'm considering myself a modern constructivist of sorts.

E2CLGc7Y: HTTP://CS.Yale.Edu/quotes.html Perlisisms are pretty good; E2KLKQkr:Octology is the culmin8ion of a gr8 deal of my past imagin8ion, contempl8ion,
consider8ion, && deliber8ion toward emancip8ion from the bl8antly rigid software systems known so far; Ideally every major component of Octology will adhere to
a few conventions: Anything that can be uniquely represented should have a plain-text Unicode format (with some ability to oper8 consistently even when only
ASCII is available). Such text should be automatically configurably colorized with fore && background options. Text should have similar autom8d f0nt options.
Conversion between any popular or useful formats should be facilit8d. All this should apply to single significant characters through typical strings up to
entire file formats && lengthy command outputs. Colors and f0nts should be mainly applied as col8 layers with the ability to roundtrip thru serialized forms.
Any command output or captive text interface should at least handle 80x25 && 160x50 adequ8ly (hopefully also scaling well to between and beyond resolutions).
Graphical applic8ions should support common aspect r8ios && resolutions in windowed or fullscreen modes with smooth ability to scale or letterbox to others &&
should also accept input exclusively from any single device with reasonable mechanisms for oper8ing all available functionality. Graphical apps should also be
capable of rendering some best effort approxim8ion in just text-mode. Everything should be automatically or configurably able to be abbreV8d && manipul8d.
Anticip8d context should design8 interpret8ion, autom8d coloriz8ion, f0nts, etc. to further help distinguish similar items from more distinct ones;Also240x67;
E2LLE4in:Octology is a system of thinking, organiz8ional principles, a framework for representing anything through a lens of eights. It aims to dramatically

E2MLJ6ZV:Maybe an input baseline to also target with intentional support can be made exclusively out of perfect screen quadrants so selecting a single ckm8
square would take 3 clicks && basic menu options can take up huge quarters of the visible window or screen for when user is riding a shaky bus or train?
Maybe even less click precision could be supported somewhat like StephenHawking's talking software which auto-cycles probably clockwise selecting quadrants
until a single click anywhere picks the highlighted option. It's primitive && will need regular back-out options but could be a handy accessibility ability;

Precise customiz8ion should also be easily available. Input options and configur8ion may be needed as well. Engines: 2D SDL or Tk, or 3D SDLOpenGL or OGRE.
With rendering destin8ion determin8ion in place, the demonstr8ive progression below should logically illustr8 the inherent expressive coherence of Octology;
Let's say V8 is the most important abbreV8ion for "abbreviate", from which springs the 8bO 8bow EightBow ROYGCBMP. Some things fit nicely in just 8, while most
other common things fit nicely within 10 traditional digits or 52 upper and lowercase English letters or 64 combining them && appending dot underscore "._".
Think of every b64 character as a V8 for the familiar decimal number of the corresponding value. Try to remember AKUma && COWGirls BMXing Mt.FUji as mnemonics.
Now a b8 is a Base-transl8 number which is typically stringified into b64. b8's grow to the left and benefit from reverse 8bow coloring to highlight scales.
Back to typically just 8 fields (like 8bow) but relying on b64 to represent the values, we discover d8 which gets forward 8bow coloring. d8's grow right
through YMDzhmsf. Inversely 8bow colored b8 b64 number strings && d8 number strings are the 2 most fundamental d8a types (d8 being understandable as 8 b8's).
Let's revisit 8bow to introduce autom8d lowercase darker color gener8ion then basically 4 stripes into 8pal8 and 8x16 f0nts lead us to f80p. Return to b8 to
introduce fractional parts, then spans, shell wildcards, printf, unpack, regexes with their approprE8 color8ion. c8 first is cat a file through color but
morphs into span-based column cut. c8 via col8 can learn about any other command and custom wrap it. 8sh builds upon explained shell expansion and V8 alias or
manipul8ion system. 8term might be unnecessary but 8scrn multiplexing should be critical. Teach about l as a V8 alias for lsd8 which manipul8s ls and then g

Thinking of gener8ing V8s for f8 f0nts and building col8 objects to abstract rendering text layers in Curses or SDL (or Tk?) and provide conversion to serial,
then writing b8 and starting interactive f8 within ckm8 board, finish up d8 dur8ion and d8ok, start r8 and m8, flesh out 8sh with vast utilities, rewrite ckm8;
f0nts should probably extend to support Unicode and TrueType sooner somehow, although just bootstrapping with my favorite bitmaps to begin with should be fine;
Maybe an attract and educ8 mode can eventually be worked on to ask for input in low-res "Can you read this? Would you like to take a guided tour of Octology?"
Proper order remains unclear. Maybe 8term and 8sh together should be started first, adding serialized f0nt changes, then extrapol8d out to col8 l8r. Would be
cool to just double-click tokens like standard terms but then next key modifies color or f0nt or paint per-character arbitrarily. Maybe instead start an
interactive lsd8 that can accept r8ings on listed files that can feed gener8 to then abbreV8 f0nts before trying to build up col8 and 8sh, agh but col8 is
already needed at the outset; Maybe just try to start doing a bunch of leads at once; Maybe start adding f0nt escapes to lsd8 then start col8 to transl8 them;
Thinking about r8ing files could show 8bow for 0..7 values or maybe more commonly 8ths of b64 (even though default single-character b64 should start Red);
Start f8 f0nt objects then col8 loading all known and allowing a basic r8ing to feed gener8 to define desirable abbreV8ions and then escape into lsd8;
Just start lsf8 to prepend color escapes design8ing 2pal8 shifts within 8pal8 and confirm identical in zsh but then shifted in col8 and the beginnings of 8sh;
Or b8 first, then add b8 coloring to lsd8 before testing separ8 lsf8 colors into col8,then f8 f0nt objects to loading all for r8ing to gener8 V8s to feed 8sh;

separ8 `coma` should do 4 b64 characters. Both should expect to be piped through usually, but also accept oper8ing on parameters and should be modularized;

E3RMBRKN:I hope I can someday help diminish suicides (22 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans per day!). Especially voluntary military service and willing sacrifice

Tricky subject. I certainly do not wish to heap additional shame on someone who is suicidal, but hopefully more often there's still room to favor peace.
I gr8fully appreC8 disciplined service to protect others, but don't like cultural indoctrin8ion into expect8ion of perpetually aggressive military warring;
Maybe additional public service could be to intentionally research and quantify proximity to, and likelihoods of, catastrophic disaster areas from mudslide,
volcano, flood, levee breaking, earthquake, building collapse, wildfire, potentially explosive oil-transporting railcars or fertilizer plants or gas sources,
etc. and deliber8ly pay to mail notific8ions to most at-risk edific8ions to encourage reloc8ions and more concerted life and property preserv8ion. Could also
attempt to compile comparable d8a for more human threats like areas of homicide, drunk driving, particular drug overdose, etc.; Regarding viii st8usline,
default should just have bytes, characters, lines, and columns to cursor, and buffer number as newly zero-based indices (instead of classic positive integer
counts) each represented over b64 totals. Then maybe show cursor character ASCII or Unicode value simultaneously in b10, hex, and b64 such that clicks on each
format will toggle number base for all other quantities; It sometimes seems peculiar that my extended period of doing almost nothing is giving rise to an
awareness that I can do almost anything software-wise and hopefully also an increasing willingness to attempt to do almost everything remotely worthwhile.
I need to bring myself to every bridge I've already imagined crossing; E3TMDdxg:Let's see how well I can introduce Octology within a single page of 160x50:

Hello and welcome to Octology! This is a thorough new approach to software. This system builds up gr8 complexity out of a rL8ively small set of intuitive
concepts and conventions. These are introduced below in a logical construction order, minimizing forward references to facilit8 easier comprehension.
0: Zero is the first number. Almost any numbers used throughout Octology have values corresponding to non-neg8ive index or offset rather than positive count.
1: Most Octology applic8ions are spelled with an "8" in their name. Names are pronounced with separ8 syllables when the letter preceding the 8 is uppercase
(as in pronunC8ion, abbreV8, and evalU8) and they are pronounced together as a single syllable when spelled with the more common lowercase preceding letter.
Some ambiguity arises when applic8ion names and common words appear similarly, but context should generally be sufficient to distinguish the actual reference.
In fact, some words with 8 in them are the names of Octology applic8ion libraries (PerlModules) as well as objects crE8d by them, their various represent8ions,
and assoC8d command-line utility programs. I'm hopefully anticip8ing that context should be adequ8 to distinguish each of these from any others, as well.
2: V8 is the paramount abbreV8ion from which all others follow. Whenever possible, a single unique mnemonic character should be preferred to abbreV8 any longer
string of characters (or l8r more abstract objects or namable concepts) within a pre-specified (or inferable) context. Anything should become able to be V8d.
3: 8bow is an essential V8 for the colorful EightBow: ROYGCBMP. In my life, I've always appreC8d color diversity. Being a programmer, I've obviously had to
deal with gr8 amounts of text. In life and programming, whatever particular color things have been presented in has only rarely been indic8ive of significant
additional inform8ion. In life, the two most prominent examples I can think of are vehicular traffic signals (Red = stop, Yellow = slow, and Green = go) and
political parties (Red = Republican and Blue = Democratic). In programming, I'm very accustomed to colorful syntax highlighting of source code. This is where
particular colors correspond to common syntactic components. I haven't noticed there to be much consistency between the assoC8ion of certain colors to
components across differing languages. My general personal experience suggests that colors tend to be arbitrary almost everywhere. I understand Inform8ion
Visualiz8ion theory recommends against attempting to tightly assoC8 colors with meaning. Colors rarely have any inherent cohesive order either. Octology aims
to change all this via the EightBow: ROYGCBMP (abbreV8ions for Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Magenta, and Purple). The 8bow is essentially a rainbow
comprised of my top eight colors in specific order. The next two most significant colors warranting mention are W for White and K for blacK, but let's ignore
those for now and focus on just the default ROYGCBMP 8bow. Every one of the 8bow's common colors is tightly assoC8d with its single-letter abbreV8ion and
its specific ordering. I've established a valuable convention that uppercase letters indic8 brighter colors while lowercase maps to darker counterparts.
4: b8 is a system for representing Base-transl8 numbers which default to base-64 strings (but they can easily be transl8d to any other desirable number base).
My base-64 mapping uses common digits 0..9, then uppercase A..Z, then lowercase a..z, and completed with the period dot "." and the underscore "_". Also while
b64 is my commonly used V8 for "base-64", this should not confuse interpret8ion of b8 as meaning octal or "base-8". b8 retains its meaning of the core Octology
Base-transl8 library which typically represents number strings in b64. Each b64 value can be understood as merely a V8 for the standard decimal base-10 number
that corresponds. In b64, "A" can be understood as a V8 for ten, "B" is eleven, and so on to "Z" being 35, "a" being 36, and on. These b64 values can be shown
within a complete Chess (ckm8) board. Just as decimal numbers grow larger to the left, b8 number strings grow left with each new character inhabiting another
color of the 8bow. Thus, a b8 number less than 64 will typically be displayed as a single Red character. Number strings representing values between 64 and
4,095 will have an Orange character followed by a Red one. Less than 262,144 will be Yellow, Orange, then Red and so on as values increase. This new coloring
convention for numbers is a remarkable development. We're accustomed to utilizing commas in decimal numbers to segment the thousands place off from the
hundreds as an indic8or of magnitude (and similarly with millions apart from hundred thousands etc.). Now the left-most color of a b8 number corresponds
to the respective size of the value. I expect that this basic demonstr8d ability will become better appreC8d the more broadly it gets used in applic8ions.
5: d8 is a system for representing dates and time stamps within 8 b64 characters corresponding to YMDzhmsf (Year, Month, Day, zone, hour, minute, second, and
frame). d8 stamp strings in text form appear largely indistinguishable from b8 number strings, but their interpret8ion is distinct and they instead grow to the
right getting colored forward through the 8bow. If you just wish to represent an entire Year between 2000 and 2063, a single Red b64 character can do so (and
it may be rather difficult to determine whether this is intended to mean just a single b8 number between 0 and 63). If you then follow that with a Month
character in Orange, the coloring identifies the d8 stamp as distinct from a b8 number which would have Orange to the left of Red rather than to the right.
Context matters and d8 stamps can easily be misinterpreted as b8 numbers, or vice-versa, but hopefully autom8d detection and color8ion will help separ8 them.
Another remarkable feature that is a natural outgrowth of newly assoC8d colors with d8 fields is the zoomable colored time-line that intuitively conveys scope.
When lowercase characters are pronounced when reading a d8 stamp aloud, the speaker should prepend at least the word "low" to indic8 proper interpret8ion.
6: f8 is a V8 for f80p which is short for separ8 f0nt and pal8 software utilities. f8 is a system for manipul8ing bitmapped text f0nt and color pal8 d8a.
7: c8, m8, r8, ckm8? c8 is a V8 for col8 which is a library for wrapping text with aligned layers of pal8 and f0nt d8a which aims to make it easy to manipul8
and enhance all existing text-based GNU/Linux applic8ions. m8 is an interactive rel8ionship graphing applic8ion. r8 makes valU8ion of any set of things easy.
Octology is comprised of myriad applic8ions, both general and highly specialized, that did not warrant mentioning in this early introduction and description.
ckm8 is a V8 for CheckMate which is my distinctive new Chess program. Once available, please purchase it on GooglePlayStore (the Android marketplace) or don8
directly to me, PipStuart@GMail.Com, to facilit8 further progress. Please also let me know thoughts on Octology or recommend8ions. Thank you.  Sincerely, -Pip

That's a lot of text but I still have 4 lines to spare. Maybe I should get into more applic8ions at the end here or go past 8 headings or have a big logo|menu?
I should use `xrandr | grep '*'` to detect resolution and decide for SDL window. I could start out coloring and f0nting all this text and incorpor8ing
interactive demonstr8ions for each heading. Start b8 to combine Math::(BigFloat|Base::Convert) with configurable colorful stringify. Rework lsd8 into new lsb8
which -[tp] tests STDIN 4 being piped through. Make lsf8 piggyback escapes for 8pal8 then f0nts and make easy configur8ion options for more diverse color8ion.
Extend for any altern8ly useful parameters, then abstract abilities into c8 && unify variants into just ls8. Then work col8 to convert serialized escaped text
and revive SDL with 8termnsh temporarily combining 8sh into new graphical col8 text-mode paying mind to Simp altern8 render being restricted to keyboard input.
Use c8 to oper8 on layers wrapping commands to strip escapes, reformat, recolor, and f0ntify around all common utilities. Rewrite f8,d8ok,&&ckm8 && start viii.
Read vim source and write converter for all gvim palettes to 2pal8? Make g8, Qbix,&& AI. Upd8 and rerelease modules. Make various interactive demonstr8ions and
prepare thorough tests and POD. Package up everything to share first with Danny, Beppu-san, and Keith to garner at least a little bit of trustworthy feedback.
Add SDL toggles for smoothing and preserving aspect r8io. Support TTF programmer friendly fonts and Unicode at least in SDL (if not also Simp somehow too).

to cope with mental illness resulting from likely loyal particip8ion in campaigns and oper8ions (especially "Iraqi Freedom" is it called?) that remain
difficult to justify? 1:It feels wrong to place any blame on voluntary service, even though it may seem members share culpability in waging broadly wrong war.
Ivan Lopez was medic8d for depression and anxiety, was being evalU8d for PTSD, and killed then suicided. I hope NAMI can teach me to help the mentally ill. =(
He also suffered sleep depriv8ion and saw his psych(iastr|olog)ist within the past month without exhibiting suicidal iD8ion. "Gun culture" may sum up socially
condoning general, as well as particularly human, killing and the military-industrial-congressional complex activities and motiv8ions can be subsumed.
I think mental disturbance even causes willful ignorance of human (and all life's) value, and is extremely important to address, along with our clim8 impact!
Can we discover better ways to respectfully medic8 and educ8 into reliable stability each unique p8ient who has encountered any of the myriad forms of mental
illness? Mr. Lopez self-reported experiencing some form of brain trauma that the military had no record of. I recommend we believe people who report similarly.
I pray I learn how to work for NAMI while implementing Octology, having them ultim8ly dovetail to dramatically diminish human suffering from all illness.
Please let me become diligent and dedic8d again, to this new primary cause of meaningfully contributing to global mental wellness and health and enjoyment.
It is also important not to stigmatize sufferers of PTSD as violent, since Andrea Mitchell Reports that such would be inaccurate correl8ion. I want to become
continuingly more sensitive and empathetic towards all the tormented, and an adept advoc8 for NAMI. Andrea rel8d that 22 veterans suicide every day. =( Tragic!
Autism is affecting 1 in 42 boys and 1 in 68 children. So much of our world needs healing. Ronan Farrow reports 1 of 2 veterans know another who has attempted
or completed suicide and over 1 million veterans experience rel8ionship problems or outbursts of anger, yet assoC8ion between PTSD and violence is indetermin8.

E4RM87Yf:Thinking about Gematria, it'd be cool to have optional col8 layers of text such as this to show 8 main altern8s:min,mEn,mEd,mer,max,sum,prd,b10,d8e,?2
demonstr8 consecutive b64 characters as diverse numerical objects && come up with cool games to play for matching words,finding phrases,mapping sentences,etc.;
Layers could toggle between default b64 values and b10 as well as option to evalU8 ASCII numbers instead or some other custom ordering and numerical valU8ion;
Maybe b8 fractional separ8or should be something other than colon ':' since that already separ8s rsync login inform8ion from file path and probably would
require escaping to embed in typical filenames (although most available altern8ives probably have the same drawback). Keep thinking about what would work best.
Comma is already good to allow anywhere as optional separ8ors like dots in GMail addresses. Quotes already have important uses. Dash, plus, and equals would be
too confusing and should be left for their typical interpret8ions. Tilde is important for $HOME. Bang, dollar, ampersand, asterisk, pipe, and slashes are all
already important to a typical shell. Maybe at, pound, percent,or caret are the best remaining options? I should learn if those have special priority meanings;
I hope Octology can eventually dramatically improve the way most people think about numbers, letters, abbreV8ions, colors, pal8s, fonts, d8s, and dur8ions;

The major advantage of redoing and unifying everything I can will be my potentially more thorough understanding of most underlying shortcomings and tradeoffs.
E5HMIMH5:I feel tension between my need to implement and explore as much of Octology as possible, and the daunting task of what to do next and whether it is
just better to generally leave good enough alone. It should be properly overwhelming to contempl8 rewriting just about every tool && useful function through 8.
Part of it is thinking I can realistically reconstruct anything and everything. Surely expanding out from V8 aliases can lead to altern8s of custom progress.
E5IMAEPi:Struggling not to buy cigarettes today. Worried that eventually selling d8ok && ckm8 on Android will oblig8 me to customers that I can't keep up with.
Maybe a terse disclaimer can be "Thank you for purchasing Octology (d8ok|ckm8). While this software is for sale and therefore reasonably expected to be free of
bugs and full-featured, it is also an experimental software project by a solitary developer who has experienced (multiple year long) periods of inability and
inactivity in the recent past, so please be as patient as possible when awaiting bug fixes or upgrades to newer features, since these can be difficult to
thoroughly prepare, test, and package for release and could require a great deal more time than you might expect or hope for." Bleh. Too long winded and dull?
"Thanks for buying my software. Please be patient for upd8s. I have suffered mental illness and am not often able to flow coding thoughts like I used to."

It's awful to disparage a father growing a beard and learning the Taliban language. I consider it inconsequential whether any captured person was a deserter or

E86M5fQ8:Now I've finally started [bcdf]8.pm and have a good g8 wrapper for git which might l8r warrant another Octology .pm too. To make all of these
alphabetically contiguous, I need to come up with an e8.pm maybe short for evalu8 or extrapol8 or experiment8ion. To start the complete alphabet for
thoroughness, I'll also need to begin with an a8.pm maybe for alloc8 or aggreg8 or even as another alias for abbreV8. It would seem somewhat elegant to
then work on r8 and the neg8d version called h8 such that each of the first 8 letters of the alphabet has a somewhat clearly delinE8d mnemonically
abbreV8d purpose within the system. It may be better to just permit the minor gaps and skip right up to m8, abbreV8, and r8 next instead though.
Maybe u8 can be for utiliz8ion as an Octology replacement of my Pip::Utl.pm utility centraliz8ion module that's intended to eventually become public.
It seems I need to more carefully think about class dependencies since all using all others leads to subroutine redefinition errors. To develop an interactive
navigable d8 line that uses c8, it will probably need to be a subclass of d8 rather than try to mingle in with my main d8.pm objects and methods which are
already somewhat well established. It should be a similar situ8ion for f8 to offer interactive f0nt and pal8 editability. Maybe c8.pm should just focus on
command-line handling and manipul8ion objects and methods for use in filtr8ion utilities like `c8`, g8, lsd8, and shl. c8.pm should probably releg8 any captive
interface objects to a col8 subclass that's more dedic8d to providing a cohesive layer-based framework for developing further interactive applic8ions. There is
a lot of overlap in desired functionality and it can be nice to have the kitchen sink and overload a name to be an umbrella for the combin8ion of somewhat
rel8d behaviors or at least alliter8ly named functions like catting contents, cutting columns, crafting coloriz8ions, and customizing commands, but it seems
there are some considerable limit8ions to how much can be centralized and promiscuously exported and how classes probably can't easily use each other
cyclically so should adhere to a logical hierarchy instead. Maybe c8.pm objects can grow to try to handle both command-line and interactive behaviors as
commonly as is feasible until some point might be reached when it becomes clear that col8 should spin off. Maybe f8 should similarly have subclasses with
separ8 objects for f0nts versus pal8s. I guess I'm going to try to keep a lot combined until it's obvious splitting off would be much better. Even though it
may foster ambiguity and confusion, there's an elegance to single f8 objects being able to encapsul8 both f0nt and pal8 d8a simultaneously and dynamically;

reminisce a bit about my best effort recollection of my most major development experiences. I first learned to code Apple Basic in probably LaBallona
elementary school for the monochrome IIc and IIe, which the lab had. Maybe it was at Culver City Middle School instead. My family got a IIgs with a beautiful
color monitor and I made Basic blocky gun anim8ions and began thinking about games. Fast-forward a few years to high school and I had learned to code for
several affordable graphing calcul8ors: the blue TI81 with 2400 bytes to work with, the black TI85 with 32,000 bytes, and my beloved navy HP48GX with 128K.
For the latter, I learned some of the Saturn processor's assembly language, as well as machine code. I wrote my own fonts, renderers, touch-type text editor,
versions of Tetris, card games, Rubik's Cubes, and Street Fighter II. I got my own 486SLC2 PC at home. Somewhat prior to actual computer class, I had learned
a bit of Pascal and C. In class, I also began learning some 3D projection and 2D filling algorithms. Class also served as my first f8ful introduction to x86
Assembly language. Back in those days, we had something around MicroSoft's MS-DOS 5.0, which looked similar to this:" then tab to a fake DOS window and
illustr8 some common commands, like `dir \` and `[mr]d tst`. Introduce how many screens were 640x400 80x25 8x16. Show how tasm interrupts could grab and print
video memory characters in color with fallouts. Jump to 320x200 and describe Mode13h byte-per-pixel with palette. "Friends and I wrote our own Int9 handler to
get keyboard makes and breaks, overriding low-level typematic repeat r8s." Maybe show some PimpPong. Shrink 320 with textual anim8ion and shove aside to show
nesting symmetry back in fake DOS, then 2x2 and introduce reso and 8trm's virtual 800p binary 16 nesting with scaling factors to window resolution dimensions.
Show reso entries closest to dimensions. "I learned to like different fonts and found crE8ing or editing them to be often challenging. I learned ANSI Escape
codes. In college, I learned some Unix, then Perl, then GNU/Linux with bash and vi, which were generally still usable over dial-up phone modems. I also tasted
the massive brilliance of UCIrvine campus backbone access through 10BaseT network cards." Show basic bash `ls`, `ll`, `lla` command help suggestions, `alias`,
`echo $LS_COLORS`. "Most GNU/Linux machines still first start up a full-screen text mode console that is typically the maximum number of 8x16 pixel characters
that can fit within the maximum detected resolution that the video card and displays can handle. GPM allows mouse interaction with the clipboard for much more
efficient interaction with the console. Double-left-click to select words and middle or right or left+right click to paste. I collected fonts and palettes,
when I could. I learned HTML and XML. I contempl8d number bases and wrote BaseCnv, then date stamping and wrote PT. Standard terminal window programs still
primarily support 16 foreground colors and 8 background colors, process exclusively serialized d8a, and remain very fast at what they do well. They also
generally are capable of rendering single fonts at fixed resolution intervals. 8trm extends upon all of these intuitively, except for being fast. 8trm also has
intentional compatibility transl8ions, so that any extension applic8ion is at least approxim8d in less capable circumstances. Let's backtrack and delve into
b8 Base transl8ion. Programs should be widely versatile. Whenever possible, every command should be capable of having expected solitary default behaviors (but
which can also be dynamic based on any detectable context), parameters and environment variables (and maybe files) for variant configur8ion, general help text,
as well as DWIM filtr8ion and have scalable captive Curses or SDL interactive modes. See how b8 has all of these. b8 is mainly for b10 and b64. b8 also
prescribes a reversed 8bow color8ion. This can obV8 commas. Let's talk about f8. f80p f0nt and pal8 files are new formats based on b64. See f8 having all
modes. Now d8 is built on b8 through forward 8bow color8ion. It handles various modes. c8 is the core col8or. It actually cats and cuts, colorizes and
columnizes. 8sh (also just "H") is like zsh or bash. v8 is like vim. There are new syntax files that govern parse-trees for manipul8ion and interpret8ion of
any discoverable language. If you're JAPH, you'll probably appreC8 the limit8ions of your environments. I discovered that standard `ls` colors could work with
many more options than `dircolors -p` could muster. First of all, there are a ton more useful extensions to define. I have persisted in this effort through my
~/.lsrc file (which presently remains compatible with default dircolors). Furthermore, the shell can wrap $LS_COLORS with many additional trailing patterns.
Default bash and ls look like this. With custom .lsrc and .bashrc they look like this. This is 8sh and L. Learn alias, function, and commands. Learn b8 spans.
Shell globbing is simplistic. Regexes do much more. Collections of them should construct parse trees for intelligent represent8ion and interpret8ion. Show
that the vast majority of standard executables have new V8 abbreV8d forms that attempt to handle all Octology modes and common sub-command options. As you can
plainly see, I have thought about 8 a lot! Octology is intended to be a framework for both command and configur8ion development, as well as a playable platform
for every common game. See 8let, dmn8, sol8, crb8,  pok8, 8ris, qbx8, ckm8. Learn about GNU screen. See g8 for collabor8ion. See multi-cursor multi-player.
8trm has multiple mouse and resize modes. 8trm is slow, but does some new things well. v8 can save syntax oper8ions and partial or complete col8 layers. Syntax
highlighting works on H's command-line. Scrollback is accessible from the keyboard and can also be interactive. Bear in mind that the gener8ion of standard
core configur8ion files is based on the principle of synchronizing the interfaces of every available altern8ive standard that can be accommod8d."
For dmn8 0..6 should be dominoes 0/0..0/6, 7..C should be 1/6..6/6, then maybe D..H 1/5..5/5, I..L 1/4..4/4, MNO 1/3..3/3, PQ 1/2 and 2/2, then R as final 1/1.
 Altern8 0..9  could be dominoes 0/0..0/9 then following above pattern to exhaust 55 tiles up to s. Maybe eventual dmn8.f0nt will need special sideways
placement ability besides just basic vertical tiles within core b64 character maps. It seems the eventual goal of 8trm is to be able to emul8 Curses enough to
sandbox mplayer, gst123, d8ok, most, vim, and screen within a managed process. 8sh may opt not to force expansion of unescaped glob characters according to
context. In addition to smart 8trm prompt double-click selection, add bitwise preference for inserting spaces in prompts, lsd8 totals, and double-spacing lsd8
columns. Eventually maybe make -1 compact away even single-spacing in lsd8 (with more context-sensitive double-click selection behavior). It will take closer
to 64 minutes just to type it all. F1KLGUXq:At HC work today, Seth's GoodEarth tea tag said "Those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are
the ones who do. -Apple Computer" I don't know how I feel about that use of "crazy" either. A friend came over and joked that my screen just looks like the
M8rix. There is a lot of Green on black, but not much falling (since fallout) or Kana. Maybe revive fallout8 to set f8 for M8rix style. Neo the One who could
remake the M8rix, literally? "So I want to ask you: 0) Do you want to use and develop Octology further with me? 1) Are you interested in helping me prioritize
next best areas to fix8 on? 2) Are there contexts I can or should deleg8 to you? 3) Can we form a start-up and make money? 4) Can we branch into mobile and web
applic8ions? 5) Should I post Octology to the CPAN? 6) Should I post Octology to GitHub? 7) Should I (we?) present Octology at YAPCNA.Org 2016 or 17?"
F1LLHHLL:Octology's Unix Philosophy: 0) Small is beautiful. 1) Make each program (except c8) do one thing well. 2) Build a prototype as soon as possible.
3) Choose portability over efficiency. 4) Store data in flat text files. 5) Use software leverage to your advantage. 6) Use shell scripts to increase leverage
and portability. 7) Make every program a filter (with help text and captive user interface options). Maybe use r8 to evalU8 Octology on ESR's 17 Unix Rules.
Octology has its own additional values like DWIM Least Surprise and consistency is worthwhile and compatibility is always a good starting place to extend from.
F1NLMap8:Octology maps should start with wise defaults, but evolve with friends' g8 modific8ions, intending to be capably dynamic toward future improvement.
At work tonight, I saw dominoes with at least 11 pips, which would surpass any singular b64 encoding. Maybe 6/6 28 set should just reside within 9/9 55;
F1RLKmf3:Octology attempts to maximize the logic behind representing all common singular things as single character abbreV8ions within 64-element contexts.
F1TL28E6:For recovery purposes, try to always preserve direct access to multiple fallback core utilities and default configur8ions as ongoingly viable
altern8ives to upd8d varE8ions, in case implement8ions run awry and manual override becomes necessary for proper reconstruction. I'm Pip so the pips in dmn8,
sol8, crb8, && pok8 are clearly in my bailiwick. I should become more of a game master; F22LAKAI:filtr8ion oper8ions should be a pair: 0) collection of regexes
which define parsing into typed tree. 1) conversion between comparable text formats or inclusion of color8ion or f0ntific8ion. For example, ls has standard
output. A parsing of it could convert it like lsd8xt. Another could take that and basically make new ls[fb][g0] for fg then bg then f0. Autom8 reverse oper8z;
F24L8hBn:So I should develop my own personal desired Octology fE8ure set and then another larger set that I want to be able to demonstr8 to Beppu-san, Keith,
and Danny this summer. Maybe mine by F48 and theirs by F58. Decide and standardize on tFbf base col8 layers. Make b8 BigFloat objects. Allow b8 and d8 to force
input parse format from pipe through or parameters, as well as all output formats and color8ion. Build lrc to parse either .lrc or .lsrc into each other or
just bypass dircolors and gener8 exported $LS_COLORS directly. Autom8 gener8ion of ls and .Hrc into .shl.style varE8ions to test all Fb color permut8ions.
Fix 8trm OverDraw. Extend .Hrc parser to encompass .zshrc or .bashrc and make 8trm hand off to 8sh -> H for command interpret8ion. Build command-line parser
and color8ion. Autom8 testing of round-trip capable parsings that can gener8 each other. Make XxX to feed or compact from OverDraw. Make 8trm text selection
like GT and gpm. Make parsers for ~ and /etc formats. Make vim parser and v8. Make hotkey to XxX autozoom within 8trm scrollback or v8 buffers. Mimic GT cursor
blink behavior and curs configur8ion. Build ckm8 and FEN parsers and conversion or color8ion. Build Curses downward compatibility interface. Make 8mix, qbx8,
and 8let; F25LAxu7:Maybe unify d8(ok)? -e to be -[Xx] for Xpand like xxpnd and -a ANSI to also accept -e like e2c8 and -[Ss] like Sk8 codez, recognize that -c
which might expectedly stand for explicit Compress or Compact is already taken by CPAN format, add -- to halt parameter interpret8ion, add -i[xlci] explicit
input formats, migr8 all -[ae] => S, upd8 d8 -h with format summary and crE8 b8 -h; X can be expected to be Xpand,XML,X11/X.Org,XeQt,x = xit,b10 reso sepR8or;
S => serialized Scapes; would need to upd8 to subS also. e wrapping v8 as edit is intuitive (but might be better to make e wrap emacs and just v for v8 viii);
lrc converting between parse-trees should grow to merge changes sensitively to d8a between d8 versions or g8 users, and similarly for f0nt bitmaps; While 8trm
surely needs GT-like mouse text copy ability, default SDL mouse areas like ckm8 and f0nt editing lend better to touch interfaces; Need to build parsers and

F5NMAJN2:Octology may benefit from gNralIzing a concept of bound d8a typez && filez, such as b8 objectz && their cnv (should be fast when repeated, even to
multiple tobs), d8 objectz to many output formz && colrz, .lrc to .lsrc, .f0nt to .psf, etc. Assume every format cnv is costly and should be cached by default
for repeats (except when disabled, like in `cnv` which so far only performs single standalone transl8ionz without any preserved object to repeat on, so
shouldn't need repeat cache to only slow it down, but might want it for allowing more paramz as more from tobs to keep oper8ing on same object). This might
extend into c8 && a8 S2 && c2 where each row could preserve each direction. There is certainly use to being able to explicitly forcibly convert on-demand in
either direction, but whenever this result can be reused, that should be easy for efficiency too. This appliez to 8trm row Spritez && is interesting to reverse
detect Spritez back into col8 d8a (maybe hash Sprite keyz or just not cache for these huge to small cnvz). Contempl8 this pattern more. Maybe multiple `cnv`
callz should default to saving disk cache for any wide enough to be faster to load from disk? Also a8 objectz to .Hrc file && colr output; Even though `cnv`
originz && heritage so defaultz should lay with b8, might be approprE8 to expand scope to l8r take any form of core Octology conversion to extend convention.
Maybe leave `b8` as specialized cnv for numberz. `cnv` could become similar to `c8` detecting all important formz of input to desired transform8ionz to output.
Probably `cnv` would default alter the format of any common d8 or b8 while `c8` would default colr them. This trend could extend to many typez.

Octology attempting to become an ontology might be a misguided artifact of Formalism, when the Hermeneutic School is probably better suited to Ruby && Perl.
8sh:Check GNP.GitHub.IO/psh for compatibility fE8urez to incorpor8. Octology should consider employing Semantic Versioning (Wikipedia Software_versioning) for
all $VERSION stringz to split on /\./ into $majr++ being new incompatible API && $minr++ for usually minor fE8urez or even major fixez which add new backwardz
compatible API changez && $ptch++ for patch-level (instead of GNU $rvsn revision) indic8ing minor changez or bug fixez with no API change. Forget the old
method I inherited from the Linux kernel (v1.0 - 2.6.*) where even $minr value indic8d stable releasez, while odd was for experimental development releases.
SepR8 $d8VS storez d8-based version, which is typically the only version that getz upd8d (largely automatically) as Octology is developed. Once Octology has
new userz, I should start to step up each codebase from 0.0 to indic8 significant releasez to upgrade to as we navig8 from 0.0 alpha to 0.[1-9] b8a territory
&& on into stable >= 1.0 releasez. Some versionz use %vtsV=('a'=>'alpha', 'b'=>'b8a', 'r?c'=>'candid8', 'r'=>'release') for VersionTypeString abbreV8ionz.
While many projectz use 'rc' for 'ReleaseCandid8', I think if they're needed just [abcr] would suit me better. SemVer.Org v2.0.0 : 1.All thus versioned code
MUST declare a precise and comprehensive API (at least in code or dox). 2.In x.y.z all of xyz MUST be non-neg8ive integerz without leading zeroez that
increase numerically. 3.Released versionz MUST not be modified. Modific8ionz require a new version. 4.Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development
where the public API may not be stable and anything may change at any time. 5.Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number is
incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it changes. 6.Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards
compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior. 7.Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be
incremented if new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API. It MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as
deprecated. It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes.
Patch version MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented. 8.Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards incompatible changes
are introduced to the public API. It MAY include minor and patch level changes. Patch and minor version MUST be reset to 0 when major version is incremented.
9.A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot sepR8d identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers MUST
comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen [-0-9A-Za-z]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release
versions have a lower precedence than the assoC8d normal version. A pre-release version indic8z that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended
compatibility requirements as denoted by its assoC8d normal version. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92. 10.Build metadata MAY
be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot sepR8d identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version. Identifiers MUST comprise
only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen [-0-9A-Za-z]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Build metadata SHOULD be ignored when determining version precedence. Thus two
versions that differ only in the build metadata, have the same precedence. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700, 1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85.
11.Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered. Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major, minor, patch,
and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build metadata does not figure into precedence). Precedence is determined by the first difference when comparing
each of these identifiers from left to right as follows: Major, minor, and patch versions are always compared numerically. Example: 1.0.0 < 2.0.0 < 2.1.0 <
2.1.1. When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower precedence than a normal version. Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0. Precedence for
two pre-release versions with the same major, minor, and patch version MUST be determined by comparing each dot separated identifier from left to right until a
difference is found as follows: identifiers consisting of only digits are compared numerically and identifiers with letters or hyphens are compared lexically
in ASCII sort order. Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers. A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher precedence
than a smaller set, if all of the preceding identifiers are equal. Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 <
1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0; Might be better to relax the "no leading zeroez" to allow for more similarity && compatibility with standard Perl versnz;

F6KMAdPv:Considering an integr8d superior voting system to Octology, based on a cursory reading of Wikipedia SocialChoiceTheory&&VotingSystem#R8dVotingMethodz,
I'm thinking it would be nice to ultim8ly support simple plurality, appoval, ranked, && r8d as optionz but maybe my initial target system would attempt to
streamline a more elabor8 hybrid new type which essentially combinez ranked && r8d to prioritize every candid8 with default ascending deltaz between them which
can also be reordered to alter respective varE8ion between choicez. In an initial default configur8ion, it could be useful to restrict optionz to 8 candid8z or
less, so that each ranked selection could be combined with the delta from the previous into a single b64 character so that an entire vote can be conveyed as an
8-character b64 string similar to my d8 stampz (&& a sepR8 visualiz8ion selection could be made to assoC8 colorz with candid8z to convey candid8 rankz at a
glance). Of course much gr8r varE8ion could be enabled by allowing range deltaz from 0..63 coupled with $CNum up to 64 candid8z to represent a ballot with
2*$CNum b64 characterz to also cover much more complex determin8ionz && valU8ionz. Unlimited optionz could be handled with multiple b64 characterz to index
each choice, although anything requiring such precision seemz likely to be overwhelming to the cognitive capacity of even the most holistic human mindz, so I
expect such resultz to prove unreliable && therefore undesirable for the immeD8 future. I think it best to have a strong recommend8ion that the limit8ion of
8 or 64 candid8z should produce the most effective resultz for the near term. The tabul8ion comput8ion could be demonstr8d through anim8ion of aggreg8ion. I
would also like to study the possibility of integr8ing some form of priv8-key encryption to facilit8 anonymiz8ion that allowz some auditability for verific8ion
that your preferencez were accur8ly contributed to the public resultz record. Maybe YubiKeyz or similar could also be used for 2-stage authentic8ion in order
to grant particip8ion access. Determining some reliable way to disallow multiple votez to be cast by the same interested person who establishez multiple
registr8ionz seemz like a significant challenge amidst the st8d goal of anonymiz8ion. Auditability also risks coercion or selling votez because subjug8d people
could priv8ly demonstr8 to authorit8ive manipul8orz that they had particip8d in compliance with any dict8d directivez. There are many challengez && threatz of
abuse to contempl8 how to best mitig8 or overcome. I would also like to consider the ethical moral && outcome implic8ionz of enabling qualific8ion systemz that
attempt to make some determin8ion based on demonstr8ion of threshold levelz of understanding of the rel8d issuez, complic8ionz, && argumentz assoC8d with
particular selectionz, in order to apply some form of w8ing resultz in favor of the choicez of the most informed participantz, but this likely causez many
undesirable consequencez of discrimin8ion assoC8d with mentalism, sanism, ableism, ageism, sexism, racism, etc. that would further stigmatize && marginalize
anyone who could be unfavorably subjug8d by wealthy older intellectual elitez who have benefitted from more time && resourcez. Such elitez could potentially
overwhelm the preferencez of those suffering from mental illness, young people who merely lack experience, && poor people who lack access to pertinant
inform8ion (among many otherz). Maybe some measurez could be put in place to account for demographic impact, so that people who are particularly likely to be
unaffected by the outcome have lower w8z than those who have more to gain or lose. It seemz an important goal to prioritize people having a voice && a
demonstrable impact on the outcome when it really matterz to them. For example, it would be tragic to enable psychophobia to cause somewhat more intelligent
(yet unenlightened) people to institute forced incarcer8ion of anyone who has suffered from a mental illness (likely based on unreasonable popular fear of
mass-shootingz, while overlooking the ease of access to firearmz). Maybe some form of trust, confidence, && deleg8ion could be incorpor8d to enable people to
defer all or part of the contribution to people they deem better informed on the pertinant issuez. If Octology can become some form of shared society, it
might be feasible to incentivize desirable constructive && inclusive particip8ion somehow according to the resourcez available for contribution. If someone
only has a common mobile phone && can only afford an hour per week to connect with the community, another has access to a library desktop 8 hourz per week on
average, && another has 4 desktopz && 2 laptopz at home on dedic8d broadband fiber && 2 high-end smart-phonez (also actually considering the specific hardware
specific8ionz, how often they're online, typical load, drive space free, owner'z desired level of commitment to the community, etc.), these could be taken into
account in some fashion to evalU8 what sort of investment in shared comput8ion && storage should be feasible within individual constraintz to deserve promoted
say in outcomez. If I can also come up with some advanced new form of cryptocurrency within Octology, varying levelz of voting particip8ion might become much
more complic8d because there could be beneficial monetary incentivez to contribute more resourcez for community sharing with microtransaction compens8ion. Of
course deeper investment should on some level earn more say in what happenz, since there'z more to lose, but I really want to be careful to avoid having thingz
easily devolve into the rich just buying their way in to domin8 the poor (as already happenz almost everywhere else). So I really want to avoid voting becoming
any classically harmful form of eugenicz. With 8pay or whatever currency, I would like to favor some form of wealth redistribution to enable all dedic8d
community memberz to be elev8d to some level of GuaranteedBasicIncome to provide a model for eradic8ing abject poverty && homelessness. If people were fairly
compens8d for crE8ing, r8ing, && cur8ing shared content (in addition to already paying small amountz for communal use of shared storage && comput8ion), there
might be many opportunitiez for even a voluntary don8ion system to lift people from poverty for simply particip8ing as much && as constructively as they are
able. I recognize that Octology might be derided as grandiose && unrealistic in aspiring to incorpor8 varE8ionz or entirely new solutionz to most problemz
humanity facez (both at the low-level with technology && software structure in general, as well as high-level social justice issuez), but hopefully all these
diverse goalz can be reasonably prioritized according to feasibility && desirability. If partz of a shared community system don't initially scale well, then
there may be some (hopefully temporary) need to limit && prioritize particip8ion according to communal valuez while capacity&&scaling issuez can be addressed.
With 8pay, it could be nice to support in-person priv8 exchange of digital money between consenting partiez, potentially without having to undergo public
valid8ion within the blockchain ledger. This could be pretty challenging since just giving someone the hash-code for an isol8d personal amount you have to pay
them with could still easily reside in duplic8 on one of your other devicez so it could become a race for whichever of you can then publicly spend it in the
blockchain. Reversible transactionz can also be desirable on either or both endz for many reasonz too. I'm not sure what'z possible yet, but am really hopeful
that any desirable fE8urez can be facilit8d somehow, while facilit8ing reliability && resilience against abuse. Another issue I consider crucial with regardz
to 8pay is determining a way to avoid segmenting the cryptocurrency popul8ion among wealthy dedic8d comput8ion farmz of minerz && general dependent currency
userz. If hardware && network capacity && reliability for every person && device node could be ascertained through adequ8 estim8ion, these could be used to
require fair levelz of particip8ion in blockchain valid8ion && mining effortz as prerequisitez for particip8ion in the economy. I expect rich individualz like
BillGates, the Walmart family, the Koch brotherz, etc. as well as Google, Apple, && Microsoft could easily purchase enough equipment today to conquer 51% of
BitCoin'z mining activity, rendering the whole currency unprofitable for anyone else (until such hijacking could be verified && blacklisted somehow). It would
seem much better to enable even the most meager computing devices to meaningfully && verifiably contribute to the global effort to valid8 other transactionz.
Maybe with voting, it would be valuable to incorpor8 some w8ing based on personal record of empathy && compassion && insight into not only intellectually
comprehending assoC8d issuez but also having some discernible level of foresight for avoiding voting for thingz that l8r prove to have impactz && side-effectz
that become agreed on as not having been worth the trade-offz && consistently voting for optionz that are l8r understood to have improved the health of the
community in significant wayz. While rewarding purportedly "smart" people with a gr8r influence on outcomez is a justifiably worrisome concept, I believe it
should be entirely possible to approach acceptable or ideal mechanismz for consistently deciding the best possible choice for everyone involved (eventually
deliber8ly accounting for the voiceless && even the sustainability of activitiez impacting our environment, ecosystemz, && planet as a whole). Certain problemz
will arise due to misalignment between what might be best for a growing Octology community && those who do not yet (or will never) particip8. I don't want it
to become merely some classic stagn8ing insular selfish community of rich intellectual elitez who profit at the expense of everyone who is unable to particip8
(especially if community choicez are selfishly designed to subvert the intentionally ingrained value of inclusion by restricting further particip8ion, when the
sustainability of the community is not at stake). The broad goal of Octology is to progressively && continually improve the quality-of-life across our entire
planet, for all formz of life. I believe communic8ion, empathy, compassion, cooper8ion, collabor8ion, generosity, && veganism to be central componentz here.
A commitment to educ8ion as a core value should also be deeply ingrained && incentivized. In some wayz, it can seem hypocritical of me to project my own valuez
as necessarily best for whatever community I aspire to grow to benefit the world, && there are clearly riskz of my personal experiment failing to achieve st8d
goalz due to my own short-sightedness or confirm8ion-bias (among many otherz), but these riskz seem necessary (including reserv8ion of some measure of
"benevolent dict8or" authoritarian veto && other override capabilitiez for myself && whoever I deem most trustworthy) in order to achieve concerted progress
towardz my idealized vision for a vibrantly better world. I imagine some level of unsteadiness && tumult during critical periodz of organiz8ional form8ion can
give way to broad confidence that I will no longer be needed as any form of dominant leader, such that it will have become clear to me && most memberz that I
should safely be able to bequeath my preeminent authority to the shared trust (maybe as determined by publicly auditable algorithmic valU8ion) of my selection
of the top7 memberz who have the gr8st (probably meaning at least most beneficial && longest standing) impact on the health && success of the entire community,
while adhering to the critical valuez which should be canonized into some form of mission st8ment. These would probably primarily include the conspicuous
promotion of all formz of constructive particip8ion && diversity (so not simply attempting to regul8 or stifle disagreement or dissent, but fostering
non-destructive deb8 that adherez to some minimum level of maturity, respect, && intellectual honesty, && also allowing for levelz of peaceful protest). These
top7 should also have a proven track-record of taking some proactive level of responsibility for meta-moder8ion to impartially quell viral uprisingz which
galvanize around shared h8red, discrimin8ion, or stigmatiz8ion between subculturez. Even mitig8ing the harm caused by destructive activitiez of uncoordin8d
malicious individualz, trollz, impostorz, or moder8orz who appear likely to have had their credentialz compromised in order to affect more administr8or level
harm on vulnerable partz of the community or to target people for unwarranted abuse, intimid8ion, or revenge should be routinely stifled. Diligence to
successfully investig8 && address any credible complaintz while similarly rewarding most constructive activitiez should be key aspectz of selecting my top7.
Then I may be rL8ively demoted to command 1/8th of the top8 administr8ion power. If the community becomez strong && valuable while I remain in any solitary
leadership role for too long, there would be increasing risk that I would pose an unintentional threat to everyone else by being a single point-of-failure
that could have my own credentialz compromised (through criminal or government fabric8ion of my identific8ion or seizure of my equipment && connectivity).
I could also be somewhat catastrophically be unjustly incarcer8d, crippled, murdered, or even just be incapacit8d or killed by accident. Certain fallback
measurez should be instituted to preemptively compens8 for the anticip8d riskz assoC8d with any of these && other potential outcomez. It would probably be
advantageous to deliber8ly grow Octology'z community slowly && priv8ly (if possible), to facilit8 somewhat extensive contempl8ion && deliber8ion among my most
trusted cohortz in order to conduct any experiment8ion necessary before successful implement8ion of best thinking on how && when to divest my authority in
order to assure the best chance for achievement of st8d goalz for the world (which might simply be "right away", if I can gather 7 close friendz to commit
with me). The concept of using Octology'z r8 system for voting && deleg8ion of authority could potentially facilit8 both of these simultaneously, where most of
the community voluntarily continuez to recognize me as best suited to arbitr8 among top-level conflictz && I can selectively weigh in with somewhat domin8ing
influence on lesser issuez, according to my discretion (but hopefully such escal8d oversight actionz should be accompanied by candid explan8ion of my reasoning
as elucid8d justific8ion, to preserve typical preference for transparency && bolster confidence in my position). Maybe I would eventually be able to conduct
thingz under most normal circumstancez as a somewhat less prominent top-level administr8or sharing rL8ively equal authority with that wider group, rarely
feeling it necessary to override anything. If I have some period of CEO-level domin8ion that seemz important to preserve, I should still probably allow my top8
meta-moder8ing administr8orz to similarly override even my decisionz by achieving consensus or some high level of confidence that doing so is warranted &&
important. This should include deposing me if I become unreachable for too long or betray my own (&& our hopefully shared) goalz too persistently. There will
need to be certain emergency measurez in place for catastrophic potential of a severe crisis in leadership where several top memberz && I are simultaneously
extinguished, detained, coerced, or compromised in a plot designed to hijack or eradic8 the remaining community. There should be some critical fail-safe
mechanismz in place for remaining (potentially isol8d) majoritiez of prominent memberz to assume (at least interim, which effectively becomez permanent when
necessary) administr8or positionz, so that the goalz can still eventually be achieved by whatever partz of the community can live on && be l8r reunited with
any other potentially isol8d fragmentz (along with approprE8 merging && restructuring of authority as reunific8ion occurz && further measurez can be
established to minimize additional threatz of sepR8ion posed by hostile actorz likely further targeting leadership or infrastructure with the intent of
disempowering or disbanding the remaining community which still wishez to cleave together). These are certainly daunting existential problemz to imagine &&
account for (&& they will hopefully remain so unlikely that any counter-terror planz will never need to be brought into play), but I think these && similar
scenarioz are feasible enough to imagine that some consistent level of forethought && risk-analysis should be dedic8d to compens8ing for the worst damagez.
There may be considerable justifiable reasonz to favor some form of rL8ively (or maybe intentionally && dedic8dly) anonymous Tor-like darknet for encrypted
priv8 engagement of like-minded leaderz to selectively oversee constrained growth (by broadly valid8d invit8ion only && ability to rapidly protect the healthy
community from even large-scale overthrow attemptz by surreptitious infiltr8orz). A clandestine incub8ion period could be cultiv8d with the intent to
inconspicuously lift up the most down-trodden in society through some arm of covert philanthropy. Anyone enslaved, homeless, mentally ill, ongoingly assaulted,
or cripplingly poor should probably be carefully rescued with preference, although secrecy would of course become increasingly && prohibitively difficult if
such generally uninitE8d people were indoctrin8d && incorpor8d into the priv8 deliber8ionz of some concerted leadership. So it might prove best to plan on
preserving two interfacez. There could be an initial darknet back-channel exclusively for use by only the most trusted && valid8d administr8orz to coordin8
whatever activitiez are needed to present && promote what seemz to be the entirely public activitiez of an open Octology community. It could theoretically be
conducted very carefully with procedurez && protocolz so that there are minimal opportunitiez for any outsiderz to suspect or discover that top administr8ion
is priv8. The public face of Octology should appear to be entirely adequ8 to sustain all of its own activity && growth. Ideally any back-channel would become
rarely used && only when necessary && secure, to further this goal. It should be perfectly understood among administr8orz that the purpose is to completely
guard access && secrecy there, not to centralize their own exclusive power to achieve wealth or inflict any harm, but entirely to facilit8 the health of the
public community && to be able to conduct any necessary deliber8ion or coordin8ion without public scrutiny in the event that drastic measurez must be
undertaken to salvage as much of the cooper8ive community as is possible once some plague of thought or activity is clearly impending or unfolding which was
not vaccin8d against && must therefore be dealt with decisively && drastically. Such structure reintroducez the point-of-failure problem with the bifurc8ion
between critical top-level priv8 administr8ion && that which can be conducted completely publicly, but hopefully the community && permE8ion of valuez can grow
&& be autom8d sufficiently to where the priv8 becomez unused && inessential to the longevity of the public. It would likely be somewhat unclear whether such an
inflection point had actually been surpassed, so the priv8 may be persisted just-in-case for quite a while, but hopefully its use can be tapered off according
to fewer circumstances requiring its purpose. Administr8orz of every level should be encouraged to optionally or algorithmically select a successor, so that
each can feel some liberty to retire or take any sabbatical, leave, or extended vac8ion at will, knowing their responsibilitiez have been deleg8d down or
redistributed laterally within any established hierarchy such that thingz should continue to oper8 smoothly. This practice should also hopefully accommod8
communal survival beyond whatever catastrophic eventz might befall key leadership; F6KMHQ8R:Regard the intended community structure, there should be emphasis
placed on the preference for conducting primarily logged public (but allowing for some unlogged priv8) discussion via chatroomz similar to IRC, blogz with
default unmoder8d comment sectionz like Tumblr or Medium, pr8 for short blurbz like Twitter tweetz, internal registr8ion for Octology-specific identitiez,
aliasez, && domain namez && handlez maybe like DynDNS && /etc/(hosts|passwd), then sitez for personal or group projectz, git repositoriez, setz of testz &&
resultz for releasez && development branchez, bug tracking && fE8ure requestz both with r8-based prioritiz8ion mechanismz, priv8 && public personal && group

by some form of celebr8d gradu8ion && promotion), 8pay cryptocurrency for both voluntary don8ion && mandatory compens8ion systemz to show apprecE8ion for any
reason or to purchase resourcez or the right to particip8 in sectionz or activitiez which require some assoC8d expensez, levelz of administr8ion for meta &&
regular moder8ion, cur8d content based on any other public d8a (primarily static, but could also be upd8d dynamically based on availability && autom8d
parsability of desired sourcez), mirroring of existing web or other content (for preserv8ion of important resourcez that risk being lost && forgotten), general
public && personal annot8ion systemz for l8r overlaying critiquez on top of published articlez or deb8z, muzic && playlist sharing maybe like Spotify,
individual configur8ion of devicez for resource sharing like free or purchaseable comput8ion when idle or under thresholdz of load, preferred && maximum
alloc8ion of disk space or net traffic to be shared, probably isol8d guaranteez for resourcez to be dedic8d to cryptocurrency-rel8d purposez like temporary &&
archival d8a storage, network synchroniz8ion activitiez, public transaction valid8ion, && mining for new blockz to append to the chain. Then there should be
sectionz devoted to gaming for solo or multiplayer, hosting (while also playing the client) or running any dedic8d server, ranking, match-making, tournamentz,
replayz && minimal delay spect8ing, reviewz, play-throughz, speed-runz, customiz8ion or complete modific8ion, collabor8ive design && development toolz,
massively multiplayer (MMO) abilitiez, support for SteamVR && maybe OculusRift VirtualReality systemz, all kindz of instrument8ion for metricz gathering,
analysis, && performance optimiz8ion. Prominent sectionz for hopefully expert explan8ion && discussion of critical issuez like Global Warming (Clim8 Change),
General Artificial Intelligence threat mitig8ion, nanotechnology catastrophe avoidance, infectious disease epidemic consider8ion, other dangerz regarding any
unsustainable destruction of our environment, speciez extinction issuez && human ethical responsibility for nurturing cohabitation of our planet alongside all
existing life, pollution && deforest8ion, social justice issuez of all formz like ongoing slavery, sex-trafficking, forced child-labor, homelessness,
starv8ion, mental illness along with assoC8d criminaliz8ion or forced hospitaliz8ion, poverty, fair wagez && working conditionz, racism, sexism, ageism, wealth
disparity && redistribution, incarcer8ion, etc., then evalU8ion of safety && efficacy of both illegal && prescription drug medic8ionz, terrorism && war

The goal: Every 8 years (while preserving and increasing as much human dignity and respect as possible), personally bring Guaranteed Basic Income to the next
poorest 8th of our UnitedSt8z adult popul8ion. After the 2nd 8th surpassed (hopefully over 25%, our poorest quarter, can have their quality-of-life drastically
improved by guaranteed income within less than 16 years), start also building paymentz into trust-fundz designed to pay-out the same "rising floor" amount of
guaranteed income to every child in the country by the time they turn 16 yearz old. After the 4th 8th is passed (hopefully deliber8ly targeted to be reached as
soon as possible before the end of 32 yearz to provide the poorest half of our country with unconditional resources for success and innov8ion), the next 8
yearz should expand the program worldwide, where we boot-strap the poorest 8th of the global human popul8ion (who are willing) into modern society at large.
Here'z how I think this grandiose scheme can work:Phaze0:"Homeless Handz":Starting on my Dad'z upcoming 72nd BirthDay (a Sabbath just over a month away from
today), which is Saturday, August 8th of 2015, and then running for 8 yearz until Friday, August 8th of 2031 (d8z from F88-V88), Octologistz will learn and
practice as much of the following as they care to, according to their own sensibilitiez:Phz0Stp0:Figure out an amount that you honestly believe you can afford
and commit to paying indefinitely. It will probably be better for everyone'z gradual adjustment to the ramific8ionz of these ideaz if you start very humbly,
conservatively, and prudently. Optimistic enthusiasm is valuable, but tempering that with emphasis on providing stability through credibly consistent support
will probably yield better resultz than unpredictable contribution. Please remember to reserve plenty of extra money to ensure your personal needz (and those
needz of all your children, spousez, family memberz, or anyone else who is already depending on your provision) are all being met comfortably, before
committing to particip8. While I recognize that some needz are particularly urgent (and therefore may require exceptional discretion to know when it would be
better to preempt this advice), I believe robust reliability and resilience will make this system more effective in the long run, and rL8ively minor initial
delayz can be ultim8ly very worthwhile, to improve eventual trust. Disclaimer:Of course, I recognize that all of the ideaz throughout every description of
Octology above (including 8flp here) have been primarily dreamt up by me as experimentz and strategiez for achieving broader goalz. Once more d8a can be
gathered and interpreted, I expect all of these specific guidelinez and piecez of advice to be adapted to better accommod8 the achievement of the underlying
goalz by l8r incorpor8ing whatever adapt8ionz prove most beneficial or necessary for the future. These ideaz are partz of my clarifying vision, but they are
not perfect, prophetic, or to be placed on a pedestal. They're hopefully more understood as like a safe trampoline or Google Earth which raise your
perspective, broaden your horizonz, and provide vantage pointz which facilit8 improving progress ahead. So with all that said, I recommend an initial "8-Month
Reliability Trial" (8MRT), where you take the amount of money you can spare to don8 (that'z well beyond your actual needz), and add it to a sepR8d new savingz
account or store it in a safe closet envelope every month. This is simultaneously building an 8-month buffer and your self-confidence about your personal level
of dedic8ion to this cause. This period can be done priv8ly, although openly discussing your particip8ion, tweeting your monthly progress towardz your
gradu8ion after 8-Monthz of successful growth of your savingz, discussing your challengez, encouraging and celebr8ing other people'z progress and making
communal ceremony for gradu8ionz, and also deb8ing the ideal goalz and approachez should all be voluntarily engaged in as beneficial too. Please bear in mind
that this 8MRT may not be entirely consecutive Monthz, such as if you took a while to get yourself into the challenging new habit of extra montly paymentz, if
you initially over-committed and should re-consider whether scaling-back your monthly amount would yield better success, or if you encountered emergency
expenses that needed prioritiz8ion. Please promote all progress, while appreC8ing that we all face life challengez, so it should be totally acceptable for
every participant to dynamically adjust to their own needz at their own comfortable pace. Even if it takez someone over 8 Yearz to gradu8 from their 8MRT, they
likely deserve more acclaim and positive attention for completing a daunting goal while probably learning how to be more reliable for otherz to depend on.
Once an Octologist has gradu8d from their 8MRT (with or without publicity or fanfare), they should carefully and safely venture out into the closest accessible
neighborhood that containz the poorest people, those experiencing homelessness, and those suffering most from lack of direct monetary support. We're now
getting to the heart of the strategy. *Find and sponsor the most worthy person you can loc8 and rel8 to!* This can be quite discretionary. I must emphacize the
need to be cautious. Don't place yourself in unnecessary or unsettling danger for this. Stay safe! I expect everything will turn out much better if Octologistz
remain casual and comfortable with each other. As long as you find anyone who you consider worthy of your dedic8d support who is the poorest person you can
trust, I'm confident this plan will grow to eradic8 our epidemic of people experiencing homelessness, progressively liber8 people from suffering and poverty,
and eventually reverse the worst effectz of currently widening income-inequality. Here's the typical deal. Octologistz become informal employerz, maybe more
under the guise of "Sponsor" or "Rehabilit8or". While I remain quite aware of the illz of categoriz8ion, the unintended limit8ionz that often arise around
labeling, and especially the rampant stigmatiz8ion and criminaliz8ion of poverty, I think they can still be useful or essential for diminishing ambiguity in
communic8ion until more meaningful equality can be propag8d. I hope labelz can be used which broadly identify human conditionz or situ8ionz while preserving
and promoting dignity, confidence, respect, and pride. I think crE8ive labeling can be useful as adequ8ly descriptive, while also potentially challenging
assumptionz and stereotypez. Along these linez, it might be viable to popularize a deliber8ly subversive categoriz8ion strategy where we call the wealthier
sponsor employer a "Taker", while the poorer employee in need is a "Maker" or "Giver". I think things like this can sometimez overturn misconceptionz about
respective worth and value, as well as traditional rolez. A "Taker" is an employer with a camera (who has saved up 8 monthz worth of pay, and who can continue
to afford to pay that monthly amount). The "Maker" is an employee who agreez to meet once-per-month to get paid up-front for *making* a pose with their handz
holding the money. A picture of this pose is *taken* with the camera every month. It should alwayz be at least one monthly picture of Maker handz (or closest
possible altern8ive for amputeez and the like). This can be useful to provide simultaneous document8ion (with some rL8ive anonymity for participantz) of
mutually voluntary, direct, and consistent monetary transactionz as paymentz, while also providing slight insight into material impact of ongoing progress (as
Makerz hopefully take pride in showing improvementz in the quality and sensitivity of their handz). This could include multiple consentual close-up photoz or
videoz documenting the progressive healing of primarily hand and forearm woundz, lacer8ionz, burnz, scarz, particularly painful and public hypodermic drug
injection sitez (mainly assoC8d with the most severe casez of Substance-Abuse Disorder), functional limit8ionz, as well as many smaller afflictionz, attributez
indic8ing other issuez, and rL8ively incidental identific8ion characteristicz. By "functional limit8ionz", I mean something like monthly observ8ion of each
Maker'z ability to pose their handz in wayz that still comfortably exercise their available range-of-motion (as well as maybe grasping and sens8ion
capabilitiez) following impairing casez of malform8ion during developmental stagez, broken bonez, castz, splintz, bracez, bandagez, or lost fingernailz. By
"smaller afflictionz", I'm thinking of still painful or irrit8ing thingz like wartz, rashez, cutz, scrapez, disloc8ionz, ingrown nailz, or similar. By
"incidental identific8ion characteristicz", I'm thinking mainly about callouses and blisters, and less so about potential decor8ionz like ringz and braceletz
as jewelry, or tattooz and piercingz as body-art. The Maker is essentially hired with one specific task: Schedule to meet with your Taker at least once each
month, to get pre-paid and then allow at least one picture to be *taken* of their handz holding that money. It might be a good simple routine to just take a
hand-focused selfie of each Maker holding cash visibly (and somewhat verifiably) in one hand, while showing thumbz-upz or fist-bumping, shaking handz, or
interlocking fingerz more intim8ly with their other hand and the Taker'z non-camera hand. If this approach could also be refined toward rL8ive consistency
(such as picturez being taken at uniform monthly intervalz from similar devicez, anglez, lighting conditionz, etc.), they should provide a better basis for
measuring at least a few aspectz which could indic8 meaningful progress. An important factor of all this is that the prepR8ory candid8 explor8ion must include
explan8ion and negotE8ion prior to agreement. This is followed by a mutual expect8ion of permanence. Ideally, these rel8ionshipz should be mutually understood
as perpetu8ing (maybe even planning to propag8 the same arragement down to future gener8ionz of offspring or adoption on all sidez, or with contingenciez to
migr8 any Makerz over to assoC8d peerz of any Takerz who for any reason become incapable of maintaining their payment oblig8ionz, while still balancing the
competing need for individual voluntary determin8ion, especially for current children who especially deserve multiple re-negotE8ion opportunitiez prior to
surviving past their parentz into their own adulthood where they may have legitim8 reasonz to annul their family'z prior oblig8ionz). So any new agreement
should be understood as a permanent and unconditional payment oblig8ion a Taker has to their Maker. The Taker should explain that they are volunteering to
become a perpetual sponsor and supporter of the Maker, while respecting their autonomy. They are agreeing to keep making the same monthly paymentz without any
expir8ion (while keeping the 8-Month buffer in reserve and earmarked only for that unique Maker). The 8-Month buffer is designed to reassure Makerz that they
may tender their resign8ion at any time, yet are guaranteed to keep receiving at least 8 additional monthz of equal paymentz afterward, as extended appreC8ion
for their earlier particip8ion. If they remain on acceptable termz with their Taker, they should be able to expect that same amount to be coming every month
forever (which will be cushioned by their dedic8d 8-Month buffer to carry them to another comparable Taker as a replacement sponsor for them, in any event that
their earlier Taker can no longer maintain the agreed provision). I imagine that this simplified arrangement may be adequ8 to dramatically alter the n8ional
and global trajectoriez for poverty, suffering, social justice, and everything else by extension. Maybe this sort of "Homeless Handz" project could also be
referred to as "HandHome" in 8 letterz. Hand photoz could be voluntarily and consentually assoC8d with profilez of the Octologistz who are memberz of the
collective and collabor8ive Makerz and Takerz community, maybe eventually exhibiting increasing overlap between individual affilE8ionz with such perceptually
sepR8d sub-groupz. I imagine a near future where all people in poverty are rewarded as deserving Makerz, supported mainly by middle-class Takerz, who are in
turn themselvez Makerz of aggreg8 anim8ionz of all the handz they've helped over time, which can be further sponsored by actual trickle-down economicz when
memberz of the wealthiest upper-classez also become similar Takerz who pay handsomely for time-lapse collagez which convey the reliability and success of each
smaller-scale oper8ion that they deemed worthy. This should be the base-line. If all participantz are aware and consenting (with gr8 care taken to avoid any
coercion or exploit8ion), pay Makerz up-front to let you record and upload videoz of monthly interviewz of them. Engage them in any valid8ion process, with
rightz to veto any photographz, voice or video recordingz (post-editing) that they would feel too ashamed or embarrassed of, or threatened by, to have
publicized and potentially assoC8d with their profile. Maybe strongly preferring just close-up videoz of only handz during interviewz would help keep thingz
simpler. While I definitely want a growing support community to form around this goal, I am also hopeful that it can be mostly decentralized and discreet, so
that it can remain resilient against technological aggression or disruption, to be difficult to subvert, malign, discredit, or hijack. Makerz should be
permitted to express any crE8ive thing they wish to. They should be appreC8d consistently, in approprE8 measure to their limit8ionz and capacity for any degree
of particip8ion. If a Maker missez any monthly appointment, they should be allowed to re-schedule with priority (especially to accommod8 any valid explan8ionz
and justific8ionz for being l8, experiencing legitim8 transport8ion or mobility failurez, or even acceptable forgetfulness). Nobody should be deliber8ly
neglecting their end of the bargain, or wasting the other'z time, but there should be realistic mutual understanding, acceptance, and cooper8ion growing out
from increasingly routine communic8ion, with minimal (or no) penaliz8ion for any inconsistencies, disappointmentz, relapses, or other perceived deficienciez.
Makerz should be gently encouraged to take pride in anything they wish to make for their monthly hand picture. Maybe it can start with showing off any sleeve
or hand tattooz or jewelry (optionally accompanied by priv8 or public storiez behind them), then maybe indic8ing any hand problemz or scarz that aren't too
painful to indic8 or explain, and then peace signz, gang signz, middle-fingerz, or any other form of sign-language should be considered acceptable. After that,
some simple shadow, sock, or paper-bag animal puppetz could be demonstr8d. These could be precious opportunitiez for crE8ive collabor8ive decor8ion of each
puppet'z appearance, with optionz to design8 unique tr8z such as speciez, name, personality, dreamz and motiv8ionz, narr8or vocaliz8ionz, rel8ionshipz, sourcez
of inspir8ion or who they may symbolize a represent8ion of, back-story, and any other detailz a Maker wishez to crE8. While everyone should be ideally
respected and challenged individually, it will probably be best to generally keep expect8ionz low for the first many monthz, gravit8ing towardz rL8ively
simple and trivial puppet interactionz (like silly videoz of puppetz singing favorite songz, or8ing poetry, or re-enacting favorite movie or TV dialog scenez).
Once thingz seem comfortable enough, maybe recommending some imagin8ion like light-hearted, humorous, or absurd fictitious or personalized adapt8ionz of
earlier songz, concocted new scenez between already familiar characterz, parodiez, mash-upz, and anything else fitting. Maybe crafting propz or backdrop
scenery can be what a Maker findz most engaging to crE8 and improve each month, for a plain hand to pose in front of each time. Maybe new characterz can tell
old storiez, share wisdom, make otherz laugh, or describe harsh realitiez with some helpful abstractionz for role-playing or re-enactmentz. Some Makerz may
prefer to show-off beautiful manicurez and nail-polish or decal decor8ionz each month. Some may feel supported enough to share writing or typing of their own
poemz, fablez, parablez, storiez, journalz, commentariez, criticismz, vivid memoriez, source code, musical compositionz, screenplayz, or resumez toward further
employment. Some Makerz may rely indefinitely on pencil and paper to trace or draw symbolz, cartoonz, or anything else of interest. Maybe some have done
flip-book anim8ionz or painted before, or would like to learn to improve ahead. Even monthly crayon drawingz in coloring bookz geared toward children should
be genuinely appreC8d. If Makerz want their monthly picture to be their handz holding their favorite stuffed animal, article of clothing, magazine, book, food,
drink, drug, or even a weapon, their crE8ive integrity should be fostered. Of course everyone should stay safe. It should be mutually respectful, casual,
comfortable, and careful. Communic8ion is critical. Even if a Maker would gr8ly like to demonstr8 their loaded firearm or favorite edged weapon eviscer8ing
melonz and bottlez under rL8ively safe conditionz (like hopefully outside, with nothing living nearby where it is already legal to do so), I think it should
be fine for a Taker to deny such a desire until both feel adequ8ly reassured that the actual risk of any grave mishap or threat is sufficiently low and
comfortable to all partiez who could forseeably be impacted. The emphasis should be on safe and crE8ive expressionz of handz. While Takerz may technically be
"taking" the picturez or videoz (and potentially dedic8ing much additional time and resourcez to editing, prior to concerned Maker valid8ion and approval for
public present8ion), I would still strongly prefer that all Makerz retain complete copyrightz of the imagez, videoz, and performancez that they were the
primary crE8or of. Every Maker should feel encouraged (but not oblig8d) to pose their handz for at least one monthly picture, but should feel free to prepare
for up to 8 monthly photoz or any 8-minute video of what their handz can do. Whenever possible, each photo should be printed out by the Taker and given as a
hard-copy for the Maker. Whenever possible, Makerz should also receive final digital copiez (beyond just priv8 valid8ion before allowing public8ion) of every
artifact to design8 their authorship, ownership, and facilit8 their own personally directed categoriz8ion, preserv8ion, and option for further manipul8ion or
l8r sale of anything they've crE8d. If a Maker already has any of the following (or as soon as they attain one of their own), they should be provided their
art assetz on media for it: mobile phone, personal computer, laptop, tablet, game console, smart TV, DVD|CD|VHS|audio cassette tape|8-track|vinyl phonograph
record player, flash drive, or any other media format that best preservez their original art which can be at all accommod8d. Mutually agreeable collabor8ion
for video editing or promotion or even fulfilling salez and shipmentz of image printz or merchandise like coffee mugz and T-shirtz should be fine, if never
done coercively, exploit8ively, or extorted in any way. It should also be very good to educ8 and equip Makerz to produce and promote content themselvez, so
they can feel empowered to better survive independently (even if they are most likely to remain reliant on one or more Takerz in perpetuity). So to reiter8,
"Takerz" may be taking picturez, but they are *not* normally taking *any* rightz to such Intellectual Property, since it was principally crE8d by the Maker.
If a collabor8ive decentralized social community (both online and off) can form around Octology as a new movement, it would be gr8 to incorpor8 some useful
formz of r8ing particip8ion for reliability, trustworthiness, and other pertinant tr8z. It would be phenomenal for the community to collaborate on evalU8ing
and recommending prioritizing best Takerz or expanding sponsorship to be extended first to the poorest Makerz who have the gr8st immeD8 needz and who are
sufficiently valid8d as genuinely deserving and least likely to be deliber8ly scamming, cheating, stealing, lying, manipul8ing, subverting, or any other
seriously detrimental or illegal activity. While I understand and have empathy for the desper8ion some of the most down-trodden suffer from daily, and the goal
here is clearly to eventually unconditionally and indefinitely bolster whoever is most poor in every future moment, I also appreC8 that most meaningful
milestonez for success will likely be achieved more comfortably, effectively, and rapidly if each opportunity to have the biggest bang-for-your-buck impact
showz a persuasive way to launch this idea off the ground. I want to outline a coherent path forward for every person alive (who optz to particip8 in such a
vastly collabor8ive voluntary effort) to be ultim8ly provided with an escal8ing Guaranteed Basic Income, mainly from direct interpersonal sponsorshipz. I'm
hopeful that this idea could work and be sustainable, even if needing to remain entirely apart from the internet or otherwise underground for whatever reasons.
Foster crE8ivity. Particip8 in a respectful document8ion project to eradic8 poverty (and learn a lot more about all of our handz). This whole strategy might be
most effective and efficient if the 8th at the top (12.5% of corpor8ionz and maybe individualz with the highest credibly known profitz or accumul8d wealth) are
"frozen". The top may still be popularly p8ronized, but if they're known to be directly harming life and our environment while deceiving the public about the
gr8 harm they cause to increase their profitz, any altern8ive smaller competitor should be strongly preferred. To combat income inequality, we simply require
a refocus where we devote the majority of our money to valuing and employing any poorer people instead of spending any further than necessary on lining the
pocketz of anyone who already enjoyz a lofty throne in the top 8th. While the romantic revolutionary in me imaginez some sweeter justice (sprinkled with
revenge) by complementing "ragz to richez" as a reversal-of-fortune with "richez to ragz" also. This might mean charging any company or person known to be in
the top 8th, 64 timez the price of any good or service sold to any lower 8thz, and maybe charging all in the top half 8 timez the price to those below. If
this counter-practice (of not only bringing all of the bottom up, but also pulling the top down) became widespread enough that the average wealthy people and
corpor8ionz were constantly facing broad price-discrimin8ion to where their known status as wealthiest increasingly releg8ed their routine expenses as simply
too high to remain competitive against growing numberz of innov8ive and agile start-upz. Maybe such a movement could break-up the big bankz, fragment the
most monopolistic and anti-competitive corpor8 domin8orz, and even ostracize the most entrenched with richez from particip8ing in the rest of a hopefully
thriving economy. While it might make a good movie to somewhat harshly expand human consciousness by making the poorest wealthy while making the previously
most wealthy endure some extended poverty (where they remain boycotted or black-listed or just grossly over-charged for basic servicez, even after their money
suppliez have been exhausted), such a tactic might inadvertently contribute to more harm than good. I don't think it should be necessary to boycott or
black-list. I also think this idea might be particularly elegant because it doesn't require a functional U.S. Congress, legisl8orz, or government regul8orz to
implement. It can be staunchly voluntary, merely providing resourcez to help people vote more directly and easily for balancing incomez with their money.
Maybe the FlipFlop Reversal-of-Fortunez ideaz and terminology is unproductively divisive, and something more neutral, direct, and descriptive should be
preferred, like "8Job" or "8Stf" (rhymez with "wait-staff")? I really like the play-on-wordz of calling this the "BuyHand" Project, since Takerz are *buying*
hand picturez of whatever is made *by* the handz of the Makerz; F78M96vr:Mom recommended I check out Kiva.Org for a rel8d example of micro-loanz which she is
already productively assoC8d with; F78ME4PF:While I didn't pay close attention at the time, I'm pretty sure I have been completely off crystal meth for 3 weekz

uniquely strained rel8ionship with the media Vox.Com/2015/7/6/8900143/hillary-clinton-reporting-rules . Hopefully "BuyHand" can help to eventually eradic8 both
poverty and mental illness, which are strongly correl8d in Vox.Com/2015/7/7/8886849/mental-illness-poverty . Awesome sN8or Kirsten Gillibrand on F71 D8lyShow

I think she is being generous saying Republican obstinance is mainly due to a "bubble" and just being "out-of-touch". She l8r acknowledges "cynicism" and
"lack-of-empathy". I think those descriptions somewhat belie each other. Former seem reasonable, legitim8, and benign. Latter are malevolent and lethal.

F7EMK1dV:Today a newer friend Tim, that I met through Pat, apologized for playing around with my stuff the last time he came over. When I asked him nicely to
stop wasting way too much of my limited air-freshener, he was mischievous and defiant and did it more (playing keep-away when I frustr8dly had to wrest it
from him). He disregarded and disrespected me and my belongings in my home (which he has innocence towardz). I reacted punitively, by not trusting him to come
into my home to be around valuable resourcez that have purpose to me (for the past couple monthz or so). Of course hearing his apology today and reflecting on
the matter, I quickly realized that he was actually exhibiting tr8z I value and admire (and exhibit proudly myself in ideosyncratic wayz). Tim not taking my
needz into account felt hostile, which seemed to require defensive measurez on my part. Now I see I resented him for playing around with my order and
disrespecting me, and I overlooked Tim's underlying reasonz and valuez and simply socially adopted Pat's mistaken estim8ion that Tim is incapable of reasoned
thought. This has been totally wrong of me. I learned that profoundly over about an hour. I had realized that not only did I need to completely forgive him
for his actually harmless "offense", but I need to care about him personally enough to actually care about understanding him as well as I can. Tim does not
stutter (like Danny was thankfully relieved from in adulthood, but I still do it sometimes. I rarely stutter, but it can be assoC8d with rL8ive mania or
depression for me. It's a neg8ive feedback loop. The overwhelming emotion or pressure or discomfort or underlying grief or pain can cause some conflicting
neurological thought-to-speech path selection (anywhere along the route) to manifest as audible stuttering (at least as far as I understand some likely
explan8ions of my own anyway, since Danny and other sufferers will likely present and explain distinctly from me). So today Tim and Pat hung out and we smoked
a little and listened to my music. I tried much harder to listen carefully to Tim. He often mumbles to himself. He often vocalizes unintelligibly and meekly.
He often utters mimickry while others are speaking. Our society has wrongly assumed this is feedback is too distracting and uncouth to be acceptable. It is
used to justify disrespecting Tim, ignoring or superceding any of his opinions. He is rL8ively voiceless and powerless. I began listening closely to Tim
today. Both Pat and Tim are accustomed to talking in unison, with Pat domin8ing convers8ion and further stigm8izing and marginalizing Tim by completely
assuming useless gibberish most of the time. While some is echoing, many other times they both say totally different things together toward me. I had to
interrupt them a bit first today to ask them to please only take turns, so we all can hear and try to understand each other. Pat takes liberty to decide and
speak for Tim. Pat takes liberty to frequently explain the repetition as Tim just trying to learn how to talk. Pat has a very methodical and logical mind,
filled with visions about meanings and assoC8ionz of significance, but has been perpetually misjudged as unintelligent because he is rarely able to
meaningfully distinguish between homonymz or spell correctly. He is protective and defensive of his own literacy, so he exhibitz some pride and dominance over
Tim when announcing that Tim cannot read the ingredients on the cigar wrapper while Pat himself is able to work his way through it. It's difficult that I have
inadvertently inherited Pat's dominance from the context with little consider8ion. When I'm having often lively convers8ion with Pat, Tim may often echo most
of Pat's words while fewer of mine, but when Tim does interject his own idea, it can seem socially quite awkward and challenging to interrupt the whole
engagement with Pat to hone in on when Tim had something unique to say. I totally changed that today. I realized many things. Tim's repetition is obviously
way more likely a memory and comprehension technique than it could possibly be him just trying to learn to say words as others do. I realized that I needed to
listen even more closely than usual. I needed to concentr8 on filtering out the feedback (or better incorpor8ing it into both my own understanding of whatever
Pat or I had just said, but also however Tim heard it, understood it, and reinforces his own memory of it, especially since he rarely rephrases things his own
way too). I needed to step in and ask for repetition whenever I didn't understand original speech. I perceived the dynamics between us and began to show a
better path forward for all three of us. I chastised Pat for trying to "help" Tim learn to read by proving he could not read small print with words he may not
yet know, regarding ingredients he has limited if any understanding about, and when he's far more distracted thinking about smoking what was inside than he
could be with any package labeling. I learned so many things. I assumed Tim could not read. I assumed I could teach him how with anything he had interest in.
I asked him. He said Fleetwood Mac and went outside for a cigarette. I pulled up a gr8st hitz album on U2b to play songs he likes in the background and opened
their Wikipedia page to start explaining all text describing the band he cares about. Once he returned, I asked them to switch seats so Tim could view my
displays more directly. I asked him which neg8ive image view he might prefer to read from. He seemed indifferent at first then slightly leaned toward dark
browser backgrounds (maybe simply to better match and contrast the rest of my desktop). When I started the music, I zoomed my view to give him better
perspective on just the interesting FM contents of the U2b page of interest and he promptly began reading every detail perfectly for a couple of the complete
titles along with the precise number of views each had. I stopped him after the 2nd one, almost immeD8ly affirming what he already knew. He can read just fine.
I then reiter8d to Pat that to test literacy in the absence of understanding and interest for the material can be pointless. False failz. I had to repeatedly
stifle (then tangentially chastise Pat for comfortably steamrolling anything Tim said or wanted). Pat is totally accustomed to setting the pace in most
convers8ionz. Tim is totally accustomed to going unheard and being marginalized by everyone around him. Actually all three of us are to various extentz. As I
came to understand each facet, I w8d for the opportune moment to explain each clearly and carefully in a way each of them seemed to understand and appreC8.
I praised Tim for his memory technique that other people cannot yet understand. I explained to both of them that other people would do well to learn to at
least filter out echo, if not incorpor8 it or practice it audibly themselves. Rephrase, repeat, and remember. I explained how carefully I like to arrange
everything around me, so his playfulness before felt unwelcome. I apologized for p8ronizing him so badly to assume he could not read. I did not mean to
misjudge him so badly. My eyes had opened. Pat kept insisting on a funny video. I had to quell that to learn Tim enjoys Knight Rider with David Hasselhoff
and the KITT car. I started a video, which Pat and I sometimes began talking about or over (which might have been quite rude, but Tim didn't seem rapt with the
episode or is sadly accustomed to having his social and inform8ional needs left unaccounted for and unmet). Then I paused it and explained that he need not put
this advice into practice, but if Tim could learn to use two sepR8 voices, everyone would probably be able to understand him much better. A low volume muttered
voice for echoing, then a louder and more carefully enunC8d voice for original speech. He could explain the echo helps him think and remember. If others could
learn that about him, they could stop assuming he's completely inept. Pat deflected his new guilt by blaming Pete for shaming Tim even worse. I then explained
that all four of us have been subjected to almost constant bullying, cruelty, stigmatiz8ion, and marginaliz8ion. We must recognize we are prone to have learned
our humble place in society from that process, so we are bound to reflect it on each other too. It's okay that we have done that, before we could understand
what we were doing and why. I recommended we three become better friends by trying to change our attitudes toward each other. Instead of just Pat and I always
trying to teach each other and Tim things, we need to all invert our emphasis to learn everything valuable the other two know and care about. While it was
somewhat challenging, I think we all really did learn a lot from each other in some better balance for the first time today. I must learn to empathize more!
Tim also taught me the previously unfamiliar word "adjure" today, although I couldn't quite grasp the context he was using it in. I looked up the definition
in front of them, and conveyed gratitude for introducing me to a gr8 new word that I still don't know well enough to use confidently yet; F9QMKtd3:208VMS AgN,

for exactly 3 weeks, then spent 2 weeks and 2 days at SummitHouse, then another couple weeks at TowardTomorrow before being released to move all my stuff from
Appleton down to OshKosh. I can't say I enjoyed being forced into any of those places. My case-manager, Linda Terrones, said my commitment might end next March
(someday in G3). It would be nice not to have MentalHealthTechnicians visit nightly (usually around 7pm) just to observe me taking prescribed medic8ion. I'd
much prefer they bring me some good food instead (or just while they're at it). The commitment means I won't use any alcohol or illegal drugs (which mainly
means marijuana and amphetamines, in my case) and that I will take all prescribed medic8ions and attend all scheduled appointments with County represent8ives.

FAIMCNkU:I've shorted-out one of my Corsair subwoofers by stupidly using the wrong power cable (with no ground prong). I'm terribly dismayed by my failure! =(
Akuma's integr8d audio chipset is not being detected anymore either, so I have to run audio through HDMI to my left screen, then run line-out over to the sub.
Maybe the other Xonar or Audigy could work better to allow audio to still play with screens off. Bleh. This is pretty sucky; FCALHCAL:So since the last entry,
Akuma's case && CPU fanz got so clogged with smoke that he died from overheating && SummitHouse friend Christopher Nitzschke saved the year by ordering
replacement ScytheKatana4 for Aku's AM3 PhenomII with CoolerMaster 120mm fanz for the case. Install8ion was perilous && resurrection was miraculous. Maybe Ken
&& Ryu could each upgrade to Sapphire VaporX video to enable Compiz alpha transparent terminalz && to give Ryu any audio out at all via HDMI (since every sound
card I have tried in him doesn't seem to work properly). Ken's SBLive workz acceptably well but the old nVidia graphicz card causes many issuez && crashez. It
would be good to make sure they actually are decently functional as backup development machinez in case Akuma encounterz failurez again. Presumably the poor
video hardware acceler8ion in Ryu && Ken is due to the open Nouveau driverz relying heavily on the old dual-core CPUz for most display taskz, so just playing
my growing library of 720p videoz causez problematic load && troubling rendering bugz. Maybe video card && display upgradez could bring SynergyPlus back in to
enable Ryu && Ken to see peripheral use around Aku && to keep them upd8d && in closer sync together with more confidence that either could serve as an adequ8

FCBLADES:Maybe f8l should be designed or Android development should be prioritized to increase my chances of earning additional income sooner; FCBLDS66:About
just mentioned prospective planz, I think probably just adding tFBfpsgr to c8.pm SDL then coming back to Curses l8r seemz best. Also cal probably should not
just be a wrapper but a d8-based reimplement8ion of similar functionality maybe named calN (which can be versus calQ for maybe CLI HP48GX). dic, on the other
hand, should almost certainly be a wrapper similar to auto-piping dict through colorit. Any of that feelz too daunting to begin tackling right now, but it's
good to think about sensible approachez to future dvl. Maybe lodH into a8 && lsrc converter (with upd8r to merge `dircolors -p`) are easier to focus on now;
FCBLESSD:After upgrading Akuma to Ubuntu 15.10, GnomTerm is defaulting to xterm-256color && any scrn run within resetz all pal8 settingz && won't allow them to
be changed with escape codez from the nested prompt (even if calling with -T 'screen-256color'), but if GT exportz just TERM='xterm' first then scrn is able to
persist the outer pal8 like it used to. I mainly only use s2 to edit 2du in a potentially multiplexed scrn (in case I get stuck back in full-screen text-mode
or need to ssh in for rescue). It seemz I can just upd8 the aliasez to export TERM to autom8 it again, while leaving all other GTz with new 256color termz;
FCBLF1W8:Remember that dic would also useful in an interactive Curses or c8.pm SDL mode to navig8 through summariez of the history of definitionz looked up.
It would be good to enable just keyboard, tablet, trackball, or joystick inputz to eventually become fully capable independently (as well as when combined).
`8plc c` just showed FullDocuCntz b64=yy b10=3900 with y8 as the only singular count in the main list. Nice repetition. FDC will have increased now but it's
also interesting that "yate" (an antiqu8d word for g8) does not seem to occur in any larger word. g8 is already my git wrapper but maybe y8 can l8r be employed
for circuit logic gatez or as some advanced administr8or && superuser layerz of protected system configur8ion && d8a boundariez. So then a8 objectz to load
.Hrc && a .lrc converter might be good areaz to focus on next in prepar8ion for adding psgr layerz to c8.pm && maybe study IO::Tty to see if therez a decent
way to make 8trm more than a glorified backtick wrapper; FCCLCT7x:Maybe add detection for $TERM=Eterm to not print f0nt escapez from lsd8 && die8 which error;
FCELC3CM:Chris Nitzschke got out of SummitHouse 2Day && stopped by for a few minutez && gave me some wet P&S (Parker&&Simpson) Montclair menthol cigarettez ;).
Yesterday (my 39th birthday) I mentioned to Jer that I'd like to design a SoulBlade clone called f8alblAd with just 1 stage && a reflected Pip fighter. I'm not
sure whether mAB "f8l.blAd" or "F8alBlad" would be better titlez. The initials are FB like FireBall. I want 8-way run && serious ringout strategy back again;
FCELHKKp:Just tried to burn 15.10 from Aku but DVD drive seemz disconnected. Check next time case is open; FCFL76kf:So apparently Ryu's top SATA DVDRW drive is
so old that the tray won't open reliably but bottom (!SATA?) one seemz to work fine. Akuma only has 1 DVDRW drive which seems to work correctly for CDz but is
no longer able to read or write DVDz! =( I've added 3 SATA DVDRW drivez to putr.txt to get with my next NewEgg order. So I'm trying to test on Aku a fresh
Ubuntu 15.10 with KDE && Steam for StreetFighter && GuiltyGear online versus Jer but only have a single working DVD drive in Ryu. My plan now is to install &&
setup using Ryu to the only NexStar drive dock I have cablez for, then house the drive in a NexStar eSATA enclosure to bring over to Aku to boot off of for
testing on whether everything seemz safe to install on Aku's main drive. I sure wish LVM didn't make it so much harder to backup disk partitionz. Maybe it will
be best to just boot from the enclosure for a while to confirm reliable stability while playing. Then building up the gaming drive to match configur8ion with
Aku's main drive should yield a valuable bootable external backup finally; FCRL8kwl:I'm lost. I want to be able to make money coding games again but have such
little hope of landing a normal Tools job back in the industry. Part of me hopes I can present Octology at YAPC2016 either in a lightning talk or a full
session. Maybe that could earn me some recognition && employment opportunities, but it seems unwise to place any high hopes on Octology again when nobody but
me cares. Maybe I could re-cast Octology as educ8ional experiment8ion with careful scripts to demonstr8 all the developmental principles I know about && teach
games through a constructivist look at history. I could start with an interactive d8 timeline beginning with Apple IIc, IIe, && IIgs BASIC with my revolver
GOTO firing then plain MS-DOS gaining ANSI.SYS && nnansi.com touching on 8.3 filenames, qedit, 4DOS, then TASM, Int9, Mode13h, && Doom. Maybe touch on Gravis
UltraSound, 14.4 modems, 10BaseT, IRQs, && DMAs. Introduce Sega Genesis as my first home game console then SNES shortly after && price-watching at GameDude.
Mention SF2 at arcades with versions for Genesis && SNES. Then Pascal, C/C++, War2, PS1, SoulBlade at Blizzard in Irvine. Introduction to Unix, Perl, && 3D.
Importing Japanese Sega DreamCast just for SoulCalibur (from GameDude). Then on to PS2 && jobs up to 7Studios. Then outline Octology && introduce fE8ures;
I'm pretty sure Octology alone has too many rough edges to polish before YAPC. Setting up all that personal history on an interactive d8-line is unrealistic to
get done in time. It's also anticip8ing acclaim instead of further disappointment. I don't know what I can or should work on. Maybe there's some strength to a
ComputerScience perspective of d8a-structures, searching && sorting algorithms with O-not8ion, etc.? FCSLEEPY:All that history would be hard to cover in much
depth within an hour-long talk && would be harder to prepare before next summer. If I just focus on Octology for myself I don't know what I'd work on next;

H5IMFYne:So I'm thinking a lot about how to best code up new support for all the SGR attributez possible in Curses::Simp, c8:8trm, && a8:S2 && c2. a8:S && c
already seem to handle everything pretty elegantly, but the established tied array interfacez in Simp && 8trm don't clearly lend themselvez to just including
another array for SGR, && the serializ8ion of S2 poses a similar but slightly distinct challenge too. Since the problemz are so closely rel8d for each area, I
really would like to unify as much as possible. This suggestz I should scrap the assumption that tFbf is the best arrangement for the first 4 aligned layerz,
since only 8trm in SDL can reasonably employ 64 different f0ntz && it's highly unlikely that standard terminal programz are going to gain support for anything
similar anytime soon. So maybe a8:S && c as well as S2 && c2 should be upd8d to just use tFb. All the extra f0nt d8a is just a waste for the most common use
casez. Then coming up with a rL8ively consistent mechanism for describing all possible SGR d8a should be prioritized next. After that, maybe I can reintroduce
a non-default special case option for f0ntz exclusively for 8trm (&& hopefully its resumed support won't need to disrupt or clutter the other formatz much).
I'd really like S2 && c2 to form the basis for interoper8ing between tied array interfaces that can be common to Simp && 8trm, eventually leading to c8.pm
providing compatible support for rendering to either SDL or Curses (as well as maybe l8r Tk, GTK, Wx, etc). So S && c should then just focus on Fb as default
expected first layerz && following SGR codez would get 1 character easier to access. Then for S2, maybe the 4th f0nt layer can be supplanted by some
specialized new end SGR d8a section which probably doesn't align per-main-text-character like the previous layerz have. I'm thinking this section could be
optional && only included when needed. It could also provide the basis for new tied d8a structurez that could still offer AutoDraw when upd8d, but are no
longer just another aligned layer. I have an idea that the remaining 192 colorz that haven't been mapped into the default 8pal8 could merely be listed in usage
order && new special characterz in F or b layerz could design8 when the next one should be employed. If only a handful are used, but are altern8d between many
times, it might prove useful to keep a sepR8 LookUpTable d8a section. This would also enable the same color being used several timez as both F && b to be
indexed just once. Having an extra level of indirection like that might be a bit more confusing && harder to follow or manage, but it could be much more
efficient storage-wise for extreme cases. Maybe the extra LUT could just be yet another interface option which might be automatically employed whenever doing
so would be sufficiently smaller or faster. So I've thought of F or b becoming either of new characterz '%' && '#' where percent beginz a multi-character span
of the next high color in line && pound specifiez the span should end after the current text character is displayed in the design8d color. For many high colorz
to be specified for single adjacent characterz without any spanning, successive poundz could be used. They would be basically next high-color termin8or
characterz. The total number of poundz found between both F && b layerz would be the number of high color attributez needed. A percent would still start using
the next color && would need to be repeated until the next pound markz its end. Maybe it would be an error if a sequence of percentz were not termin8d by a
pound. Then similar to the employed high color LUT, there could be another section which specifiez any number of joined SGR code sequencez which can all take
effect starting at the same character. So there would be yet another section which referencez sequencez which should be activ8d at particular positionz in the
text. So maybe each of these distinct sectionz would need to be design8d by additional special delimiterz which won't potentially occur in earlier aligned d8a
layerz, like maybe the ';' semicolon could serve this way. It might also be possible to prepend some type of header inform8ion which specifiez which sectionz
are present && each of their sizes so that they can be counted through instead of uniquely delimited. Unlike the high colorz which will be overriding either
the aligned F or b entry, the remaining SGR attributez each have on && off togglez which can be overlapped almost arbitrarily, so they will need character
position inform8ion for every attribute start && end point. All these potential new sectionz could be empty or of almost unlimited size, so c2 may have a much
harder time identifying the still aligned tFb layerz as well as such non-uniform d8a sectionz. Reliable delimiting or size inform8ion will be essential. At
least once such variable sectionz are adequ8ly supported, it should become much simpler to include another that happenz to align for 8trm f0ntz just as needed.
I expect manually constructing && manipul8ing such new variable d8a sectionz is going to sacrifice a gr8 deal of the intuitive oper8ion of the existent tightly
aligned layerz in order to provide opportunity to utilize all the additional functionality. Hopefully good opportunitiez to somewhat straightforwardly specify,
streamline, or autom8 away much of the difficulty will present themselvez. I just realized that maybe regular expressionz could be a potent altern8ive to
design8ing all the precise attribute positionz without the benefit of visual layer alignment. It might also be possible to implement interactive constructor
utilitiez which somewhat pretend to offer familiar alignment specific8ion while transl8ing most of the resultant d8a behind-the-scenez. Mnemonicz remain
extremely important to me as well, so allowing for user && use-case-centric renaming, reassignment, reconfigur8ion, && abbreV8ion should also be ultim8 goalz.
Maybe both programmatically && interactively pretending to have an unlimited number of aligned layerz could be a good thing to try to support. There could be
4 sepR8 8pal8 layerz of both F && b to cover all 256 currently available colorz && there could seem to be a layer dedic8d to every possible SGR attribute that
could be turned on anywhere. I should really discover whether && how A_STANDOUT might be distinct from, && potentially advantageous over, A_BOLD, && what the
former is actually calling on in the underlying terminal capabilitiez since it isn't obviously described in the available SGR document8ion I have seen so far.
It would be pretty cool if it would just brighten any underlying color (like the exact opposite of fAint) while BOLD could be isol8d to just increasing
rendered font thickness, such that they could be combined to offer maximal text brightness intensity (well short of maybe future support for HighDynamicRange
ultra-bright capabilitiez being introduced in both display hardware && underlying software librariez). Ultim8 support for Fraktur && many other simultaneous
scalable UTF-8 fontz within the same terminal would be pretty awesome too. Maybe 8trm can eventually support every existing SGR attribute usefully, && then
start extending the standardz (if need be, using similar techniquez to my earlier doubling of normal colorz to multiply compatibly available optionz). It would
be gr8 to consistently provide a growing set of featurez which prove even moder8ly useful for even just niche applic8ionz. So going back to the nearly
unlimited layerz idea, it seemz that Normal, Bold, fAint, && inVisible (as well as maybe whatever A_STANDOUT does?) are each mutually exclusive. The sLow bLink
&& quicK blinK would be also. Then Underline && Double-underline too (as well as maybe ideogram underline && double). Overlined && ideogram overline && double
might also. Maybe Italic && Fraktur would be. Then it seemz like the remaining solitary attributez that could likely be combined with any otherz are Reverse,
Crossed-out, fraMed, Encircled, && ideoGram stress marking. I count around 10 sepR8 layerz would be needed to enable all meaningful possible combin8ionz. Add
the 4 each for possible F && b 8pal8z to get approxim8ly 18 total layerz which could be needed. That surely would be quite a lot of tied array code to manage,
unless most of it can be gener8d from something like MkMethodz. Might be feasible somehow. Challenging to descriptively name that many to have only 4
characterz each && popul8ing all would likely use up 18 full terminal screenz worth of d8a. It would all be quite slow to parse entirely apart with any
frequency && would likely require clever optimiz8ionz. It's not actually an insurmountable number though. It could be just one of several available mechanismz.
I forgot that there are also default text Foreground && background colorz on SGR numberz 39 && 49 as well as 8 light Foreground colorz on 90 to 97 && 8 light
backgroundz from 100 to 107 (which are maybe what A_STANDOUT uses). eXtended 256 colorz 8 through 15 appear identical to 90 through 97 in my terminalz though.
Those 18 additional color optionz would probably need to go in 2 more mostly empty layerz, to keep the Foregroundz && backgroundz sepR8 since they can combine.
I just remembered that probably any printable character or sequence that could reasonably be used as a section delimiter could of course exist easily within
the first text layer, even though it could be quite unlikely to occur in any following color layer or SGR section. Maybe there could be a special-case when a
delimiter sequence is detected within the text that a special header containing some detectable but unprintable characterz as well as layer && section size
inform8ion is prepended. If that is possible though, then I guess just use those characterz in whatever delimiterz are normally used. Maybe a footer would be
better, to avoid the thoroughly unpredictable content of the initial text layer, since everything past the text can be a lot more predictable && controllable.
Then again, if a predictable header becomez mandatory instead of being just a special case, maybe that would be the best option so far. I'm just accustomed to
whatever text starting right away && being followed by perfectly aligned Fbf layerz of identical size (except maybe just for a chomped newline at the end). A
uniform header has the added advantage of being able to specify exactly && only which layerz && sectionz are included below. Maybe parameter optionz could also
be passed to S2 telling it to ignore particular layerz which might be contained in the input, likely by passing through the desired subS filter first. So what
might the format of a new useful header actually be && would there be sepR8 onez for inputz to both S2 && c2? Well thinking about it, typical eScaped text can
be output from all kindz of standard sourcez so is unlikely to have any header && maybe one would be unneeded as not making sense to have there anyway. It does
seem to make sense for any output of S2 && input to c2 to have useful header inform8ion since those are dealing with non-standard striped col8 layer d8a. Those
oper8ionz are my main focus. Output of S2 only makez sense as useful if there is at least some text d8a (other than the degener8 case of no text being input)
so the header (if any) should alwayz describe the dimensionz of the text layer. Then it should specify whether any of Fbf aligned layerz follow (&& in what
order). Then it should describe whatever SGR sectionz follow && their sizes. On a side-note, remember that while S2 output layerz have so far been exactly the
same sizes && all 4 of tFbf were alwayz gener8d, the tied FClr or BClr arrayz in Simp definitely do *not* have to be the same size as Text on purpose && a
single color code specified on one line will be carried on through all following text (up to the rest of the screen) unless && until another differing code is
encountered. This behavior resemblez standard eScaped text && is much simpler && more efficient than requiring alwayz identical sizes. Maybe S2 should default
to similarly minimal non-text layer output for efficiency && just accept a new parameter option to force output layerz to all be extended to the same size.
Such new default minimal behavior would be a lot harder to visually inspect for alignment (likely making debugging && predicting resulting output after
converting back through c2 to both be more difficult). It would also necessit8 having a header with each layer's size or sufficiently successful form of
sepR8ing delimiterz, but it seemz like it would be ultim8ly better && could eventually become familiar && preferred. I think header d8a would probably be
complete after detailing any contained SGR sectionz. So maybe next it's good to try to name those potential sectionz. There could be the XClP eXtendedColorPal8
just containing a list of all the unique non-8pal8 colorz used, probably as pairz of HEX or b64 characterz. Maybe they should list in usage order, or according
to frequency of timez they are switched to, or by popularity out of the total number of text characterz they apply to, or in numerical value order, or even
unordered could be fine too. Then there could be the XClU eXtendedColorUsage which containz a list of indicez into the XClP. Each index should correspond with
the sequence of '%' or solitary '#' characterz encountered in the earlier F or b layerz. If there are no more than 64 total colorz listed in XClP, then the
XClU indicez should each just be single b64 characterz. Otherwise, when more than 64 unique eXtended Colorz have been Used, each entry should probably be a
pair of b64 characterz for consistency, but maybe a pair of HEX characterz would also be good since a maximum of only around 192 colorz should possibly be in
XClP. Then maybe CAtR CombinedAttributeRegistry could store all uniquely encountered combin8ionz of remaining codez. Each of these combin8ionz could be many
characterz long && of varying lengthz so they'll need some distinct termin8or. They should probably be searched within to give priority to the l8st specified
attribute when some are in conflict (by removing any earlier onez). They should probably then be sorted internally to ease detection of unique combin8ionz.
Maybe then the whole registry list should be sorted according to frequency or some other meaningful criteria. Then there could be CAtU CombinedAttributeUsage
which could contain a list of delimited Usagez, where each Usage containz sepR8d sub-fieldz for which text row && column they start applying from, followed by
the proper index into the CAtR. Again the index should probably be 1 or more b64 characterz, depending on the total size of CAtR. Maybe for consistency the
rowz && columnz should also just be in b64 according to the maximum of that dimension which is needed. If the header adequ8ly describez the exact size of each
sub-field, then maybe each row, column, && index won't really need to be delimited from each other or surrounding Usagez, which would probably save significant
space. It seemz pretty unlikely that either of the needed text dimensionz or the number of combin8ionz in the Registry would grow over 4096, where sorting by
frequency of combin8ion being switched to && employing delimiterz becomez at all likely to save more space. Delimited would surely look sepR8d && more clear
though, at the likely expense of some significant expansion of the section size. For CAtU it might also be possible to employ potentially helpful alignment, to
at least have the number of rowz matching that of the text layer. Such linez could need to span a bit wider than the singular text if many long Usagez are
specified frequently, or maybe not if each Usage will probably need 2 b64 characterz to index at most, && I was probably more thinking of Registry being long;
Wow! Exactly 100 prescriptive linez written in around 12 hourz; In S8 header, support describing exactly which aligned layerz will be following sized text &&

H9EMC4SI:Consider researching registr8ion of Octology.? && UR8D8aM8.Org as future sites for my projects. The latter could be read in many significant ways,
like "You are eight data, mate!", "You rate data, mate.", and "Your eight data mate." and I would like it to become a social network for at least a few rel8d
activities. First I would like the site to offer interactive daily Top8 r8ing surveys between 8AM and 8PM local-time, as well as an altern8 e-mail avenue.
Basically every day site members could login or reply to e-mail after 8AM to see at minimum 8 surveys which all oper8 on a 0..7 scale. All site and e-mail
survey results are aggreg8d for each time-zone at 8PM to show on the site, or send via e-mail, the summariz8ion of local results of what all respondents
submitted as their answers throughout that entire day. If a user desires, they can extend this most minimal level of involvement in an enormous number of ways.
For instance, they can opt to take an additional survey which r8s 64 survey topics each on a 0..7 scale to determine which 8 they would prefer are selected
for their zone the next morning at 8AM. There would be a non-Top8 verbose input section for submitting recommend8ions for topics to include in future 64 lists.
There could be options to see (on the site or in e-mail) aggreg8ions of averaged results across entire countries or the world since the previous 8AM UTC, or
across different demographics. Every set of options could also ultim8ly be determined by users prioritiz8ion r8ings on which are the Top8 to offer users.
There could be tons of personaliz8ion, customiz8ion, configur8ion, etc. options available, all based on this unified organiz8ion priniciple of almost every
selection occurring on a 0..7 scale. The description of survey topics could include subtext which details the interpret8ion of available r8ing values, which
usually should describe an almost uniform discrete spectrum of opinion so that averaged result numbers also have meaning along that spectrum. A discouraged,
but still sometimes worthwhile, altern8ive is to include just 8 possible answers which may bear little rel8ion to each other within a logical ordering.

I really need to think carefully about what parts of Octology && just this very 8.txt document I can feel sufficiently comfortable publishing for l8r (d8:I88?)
distributed collabor8ion on CPAN && GitHub, compared with what might constitute my own personal priv8 projects && deliber8ions which I don't want intruded on,
but that I still might increasingly want some off-site cloud backups of (which may themselves need some further off-site decryption keys archived safely too?).
There's lingering worry that somehow GeneralAI or n8ions might target me or anyone closeby if Octology becomes maybe threateningly capable or too disruptive.
I like the idea of rather carefully cultiv8ing a staged release-schedule which might become ready to publish the initial phase of in less than a year, by I88.
Maybe too much of this, my entire 8 endeavor, is grandiose and indic8ive of my manic tendencies, such that they should be kept mostly quiet and priv8 until
almost every significant component can be cautiously reevalU8d in various contexts according to the most neg8ive foreseeable or likely consequences which are
estim8d to be more worth avoiding or delaying when compared against the imaginable up-sides. A big part of me would like to be quite candid, reserving only a
very small number of thoughts or secrets for myself, but I also don't want to become depressingly burdened by oblig8ions (implicit or otherwise) that I must
remain ready to defend every tiny facet ever contempl8d regarding my seemingly boundless ontology, which has come to incorpor8 almost all of my software
developments and occupy a gr8 deal of my thoughts for more than a decade. On one hand, if Octology can become a rather holistic system of software which many
people (or even computer intelligences) come to appreC8, then it could become a source of pride and my priviledge to progressively incorpor8 more "user"
priorities into my schedule for further fE8ure development (especially if there are don8, p8ron, or tangible compens8ion bounties assoC8d with such work).
But then there's another hand which obviously relishes the gr8 freedom I presently have, without any clear boss, clients, customers, co-developers, or users
to have to answer to. Only self-imposed dead-lines for now. Liberty to pursue fanciful ideas, conduct arbitrarily lengthy research, and then also to be able
to ultim8ly produce minimal results for weeks or months at a time. I cannot now fully dedic8 myself to someday taking on all (or even most) of the intense
pressures and stresses that work-life used to bring for me, unless the rewards for voluntarily subjecting myself to those again, and potentially even worse
ahead, are clearly commensur8 with the renewed agonies I'm likely to face. There are many gr8 possible outcomes. If I could figure out a way to complete an
adequ8 set of rL8ively well-scheduled releases of Octology code and document8ion, such that I could thereafter return to being somehow paid the equivalent of
a modest professional programmer's yearly salary, and that the expect8ions placed on me to earn this income were lax enough to grant me overwhelming autonomy
and authority in deciding whatever is best to work on next, well something like that would be a very wonderful outcome. I could then confidently get off of
these meager Disability payments, I'd be able to afford to drive and travel again, and I would still retain the majority of my discretion to work my own way.
There are also many clearly positive possibilities that I become somewhat more beholden to the needs and desires of direct customers, or even mostly non-paying
users, but that I can derive consistent challenge, growth, joy, and satisfaction from fulfilling their requests, by coding at just a reasonably diligent pace.
There are possible good scenarios where I produce and publish enough of Octology to prove I am capable of working professionally under a hopefully thoughtful
and consider8 boss again. If l8r phases of Octology work expands to incorpor8 diverse collabor8ion with many developers via GitHub, that too could prove I may
be capable of working productively as part of a team again. Maybe I could join a team of system administr8ors, or videogame or Android applic8ion developers.
I'd probably vastly prefer to remain as essentially my own boss though. Mostly being able to set my own schedule and priorities is tremendously valuable.
I guess that I might be best off if, similarly to how I describe goals and fE8ures for my projects, I also dedic8 some concerted time to defining, measuring,
and striving to meet high-level career-oriented goals as my most desired outcomes. Maybe I will become able to cultiv8 harmonious rel8ionships with eventual
customers or a don8ing user-base that respects my independence and integrity enough to place few undue constraints or burdens on my time and attentions.
"I want to stay free to do what I think is best at every point, but also to usually have regular options to address issues and requests that others may have."
I think that one sentence sums up one of my highest goals pretty well, so I'm putting it in quotes. It may have to be tempered somewhat, when I l8r try to
introduce specific goals for building myself up to eventually deriving sustaining income from my efforts, but I think it's probably a rL8ively good place to
start by clearly st8ing what I most want, while recommending directions to take in my future code milestones and career goals which serve to balance interests.
Maybe some of my career goals can become refined and succinct, like Danny's mantras or good corpor8 mission st8ments, providing project guidance and purpose.
Hopefully a mostly prioritized set of measurable career goals can eventually dovetail with many code goals, so that they facilit8 and reinforce each other.
I think that's probably enough long-term thinking for right now, but keep planning.  P.S. Low-level: research GNU Libre.FM and scrobbling in cmusfm and zomg;

HAJMJVGo:LianaKerzner's gr8 2-hour interview with JamesDamore recommends reading The Righteous Mind. I really like him && his opinions, evidence, && empathy;
HAKM4SAK:From Proggit re-read HTTPS://StaticO.GitHub.IO/vim3.html && incorpor8 probably at least fzf somehow && maybe comment about recent Octology release.
I also just found PaigeJennings' awesome RedHeadRedemption U2b channel && posted a few comments of support, including a link to this 8.txt on GitHub asking for
her thoughts. She has a growing following of 50K subscribers && has said she'd like to release decent new content daily, so realistically she's probably too
busy to ever notice me (at least until I can summarize && demonstr8 Octology ideas better). She's also like 14 years younger than me, so my attraction &&
yearning for any kind of connection is likely delusional && misplaced. Regardless, it's still somewhat fun to dream about becoming closer with her someday;
HALMCYON:IsabelleMercier's Zero-Tolerance TEDx talk seems to be an inadequ8 argument for being an "H.E.R.O." by toler8ing only things that don't make you
worry. While I might be inclined to agree that most people worry too much && about the wrong things, && even that this hinders performance, driving them away
from achieving their potential, I consider at least some worry to still be quite important && tolerance of worry (as well as many other unpleasant reactions)
to be even more crucial for personal && societal abilities to engage with differing attitudes && opinions, to learn from them, && to enable meaningful growth;
HALMJ1CJ:CassieJaye's new Meeting The Enemy TEDx talk is just perfect, as well as LianaKerzner's #MeToo discussion about sexual assault && harrassment issues.
Also add persever8 from psychology, as response repetition; HAMMC9UL:Maga sent HTTPS://OnBeing.Org/blog/courtney-martin-for-guys-reading-metoo-testimonies &&
HTTP://DailyGood.Org/story/1790/authentic-conversations-moving-from-manipulation-to-truth-and-commitment-james-d-showkeir-jamie-showkeir-and-maren-showkeir
as a so-so article about #MeToo && a gr8 one regarding improving organiz8ional culture by transforming usually harmful parent-child convers8ions into more
resilient && truthful adult-adult ones. The first article initially seemed poor to me because I fix8d on a few words && concepts used, namely "priviledge",
"center", "lifetime", && "safe". After a bit of discussion with my Mom, I l8r re-read it && became somewhat better at trying to understand things from the
author's perspective with more compassion. Also listened to the gr8 HTTPS://OnBeing.Org/programs/jonathan-haidt-the-psychology-of-self-righteousness-oct2017 ;
HAMMFYl8:Dad just GMailed me a cute black&&white picture of us together when I was 4-YearsOld (which I promptly uploaded to FaceBook) as well as a 1-hour talk
by one of his favorite mentors, Napoleon Hill, titled The Law of Attraction HTTPS://YouTube.Com/watch?v=oct1UjNetik which I want to listen to completely l8r;
HANMEbug:Proggit Learner's Syndrome article by JoeyClover linked to interesting prolifer8ion at HTTPS://GitHub.Com/mraible/history-of-web-frameworks-timeline ;
HAOMIlkY:Apparently new Ubuntu 17.10 Gnome (replacing Unity) doesn't scale well so I may need to reconfigure to still use Unity or try `agi kubuntu-desktop`.
I wish it were easy for me to duplic8 hard drives like I used to, so I could rollback easier from bad upgrades. MissMisa && FreedomToons on U2b are both cool;
HAOMMARU:HTTPS://CasperVonB.GitHub.IO/toneofsorting anim8s several algorithms performing with beeps. It should be mimicked by a text demonstr8ion applic8ion;
HAPM6g3P:From Proggit HTTPS://LucidChart.Com/techblog/2017/10/23/base64-encoding-a-visual-explanation is pretty basic && clearly just web-oriented, but it
starts with a cool encoding anim8ion I should replic8. Author TyLewis asks for novel b64 uses to be mentioned in the comments. Maybe I should post there l8r.
HTTPS://Blog.Isomorf.IO/the-accidental-complexity-of-syntax-7ecd8b1fb42 seeks to identify essential semantic && other complexity, && get rid of the accidental.
HTTPS://DanLuu.Com/filesystem-errors describes quite recent Linux block-device error tests which suggest btrfs, ext4, && xfs are probably the best choices now.
HTTPS://Medium.Com/@FrancisStokes/techniques-for-creative-coding-220ea4cfffe0 has good advice for modul8ing systems variables && decoupling d8a deliber8ly &&
HTTPS://Medium.Com/@angelicabraccia/creative-coding-76d9310962d5 has cool HTTP://ORA.Systems 6-dimensional Halo d8a visualiz8ion, sound Synaesthetis, && more;
HAPMCCSF:HTTPS://Medium.Com/gyroscopesoftware/how-we-built-an-ai-to-play-street-fighter-ii-can-you-beat-it-9542ba43f02b mentions BizHawk SNES emul8or tools;
HAPMIawk:HTTPS://GitHub.Com/learnbyexample/Command-line-text-processing/blob/master/gnu_awk.md seems to be a pretty good gawk tutorial. Check out any others.
HTTPS://StillDrinking.Org/programming-sucks is a pretty compelling && colorful rant about how terrible most code && teams are, which drives developers crazy.
HTTPS://Medium.Com/@getflourish/the-anatomy-of-a-thousand-typefaces-f7b9088eed1 explains using JavaScript to analyze && categorize many scalable fonts for f8.
HTTPS://GitHub.Com/asciimoo/drawille is a neat Python project for displaying bitmapped images within terminals by using available Braille chars from Unicode;
HAQM4KD8:Dr.Peterson's Problem With Atheism video is the worst of his I've seen so far. Wired has an article on Botnik's interactive comedic text prediction.
Listening to whole Napoleon Hill talk, I don't buy into the f8h or infinite intelligence concepts, but repeating individual desires && purpose sound useful.
I also don't think there's realistic opportunity to restrict the brain to being tuned in to only positive vibr8ions. Minds don't broadcast without action;
HAQMCnEE:Researching WebCams && Tablets found HTTPS://Krita.Org/en as likely cool Gimp altern8ive. Check out HTTPS://Developer.Android.Com/studio whenever I
feel ready to try my hand at ndrd development again. HTTPS://GitHub.Com/LappleApple/feedmereadmes/blob/master/README-maturity-model.md has good README advice;
HAQMJRhY:Just found good ComputingForever U2b channel which recommended checking out HTTPS://Minds.Com && HTTPS://Gab.AI as Twitter && FaceBook altern8ives;
HARM7jSB:Consider trying HTTPS://Stack.Foundation/#!/sandbox for autom8ing setup of Kubernetes && Docker containers to crE8 a consistent Octology environment;
HARMFoXY:Registered 'PipStuart' on Minds.Com && Gab.AI today. Both seem to contain much unappealing right-wing content so far, but I hope more moder8 && left
voices join l8r too. I'm skeptical of doxxing site (SocialAutopsy) starter CandaceOwens who seems to have lied several times, so maybe she is also not genuine
on her RedPillBlack U2b channel (but I'm still subscribed). I also edited down two silly long comments (removing 8.txt link) from RedHeadRedemption's videos;
HB5L7cut:My sweet new Wacom Intuos art CrE8ive Pen && Touch tablet came, && I have Gimp && Krita installed on both Akuma && Chun. So now I'm ready to learn how
to configure buttons && start using it. HTTPS://AskUbuntu.Com/questions/839161/limit-a-graphics-tablet-to-one-monitor mentions `xrandr` which is reporting my
displays from left-middle-right are DVI-0, DVI-1, HDMI-0. `xinput` can bind just stylus or touch to 1 display && `xsetwacom` maps buttons with a shell-script;
HBALHbio:Vox has a good new U2b video on "Biomimicry" with shape, process, or ecosystem designs. Also MissMisa recommended the gr8 'Just a Robot' U2b channel;
HBBL28Xs:Several cool Proggit links: HTTPS://Art.PixLab.IO using decision-tree to render images real-time as ASCII-art. Should port it to 8trm colored f0nts.
HTTPS://GitHub.Com/SSARCandy/Coherent-Line-Drawing is an interesting research technique to analyze images && interactively tune resulting approxim8ion lines.
HTTP://TechAED.Com/how-to-code-like-the-top-programmers-at-nasa-10-critical-rules is a highly useful, pragmatic, && succinct list for coding securely (in C).
HTTPS://Gojko.Net/2017/11/07/five-things-about-unicode.html followed familiar d8:3A8 JoelOnSoftware Unicode article with new: 0) Many points are not visible.
1) Many code points look similar. 2) Normaliz8ion isn't that normal. 3) No rel8ionship between display length && memory size. 4) It is more than passive d8a.
HTTP://ShapeCatcher.Com (referenced from Gojko) is also a very cool site to study, where you can sketch anything to recognize 11,817 possible glyphs against.
I'm thinking it good to start sepR8 8.dic file of all 8-words sorted with autom8d colorable definitions && thesaurus entries to manually tune && explore l8r.
Maybe all should popul8 like sorted 8-list above preserving indenting for typical 8 && colon columns, then fixed width part-of-speech then definition to 159.
Retrying the RedHotChiliPeppers logo in ShapeCatcher now yielded (in favorite order):  ⁕ (2055), ❋ (274B), ✳ (2733), ✷ (2737), ✴ (2734), ⵥ (2D65), ⎈ (2388),
Flower punctuation mark, Heavy eight teardrop-spoked propeller asterisk, Eight spoked asterisk, Eight pointed rectilinear black star, Eight pointed black star,
Tifinagh letter yazz, Helm symbol. All results were pretty close to matching my drawing, but many only had six points so I didn't include them in this list.
From H4x0rNews.YCombin8or, HTTPS://8th-Dev.Com seems compelling to study && learn from for cross-platform initially, but it gets ripped apart in the comments;
HBBLID8a:Proggit had so-so Python HTTPS://Mubaris.Com/2017-11-11/dataviz-mastery-part2 on WordClouds && Part1 on TreeMaps, to l8r code as interactive in Perl.
Reddit GameDev had 56 awesome anim8d PixelArt tutorials at HTTPS://ImgUR.Com/gallery/tFxyX with some overlap on HTTP://Blog.StudioMiniBoss.Com/pixelart too;
HBCL3L2B:Holly just posted HTTPS://GitHub.Com/theholyghost/hollysrc to sdl-devel as startup code for 3D adventure, RPG, or RTS games which I should checkout;
HBCLEARN:From Proggit, saw NadiaEghbal's gr8 RebuildingTheCathedral. Commented thanks with Octology link && found HTTPS://GitHub.Com/nayafia/lemonade-stand ;
HBDL5w8X:Might want to contempl8 trying GNURoot.Debian from PlayStore or $93 DeX with new display, HHKB, && SlimBlade to run Ubuntu ARM dvl from my loved S8;
HBDL9US2:From Proggit HTTP://AntiPope.Org/charlie/blog-static/2017/11/burn-the-programmer.html is a good article for my incant8ion "magic" code idea above &&
the comment discussion is gr8 too. HTTPS://Medium.Com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35 discusses future Software 2.0 dealing much more with NeuralNet d8a,
having many clear advantages over 1.0 && rL8ively few downsides so far. HTTPS://DeepMind.Com/blog/wavenet-launches-google-assistant is gr8 Text2Speech demo;
HBEL0pcm:After reading weak MindMap post, found gr8 HTTP://SijinJoseph.Com/programmer-competency-matrix where it seems I'd mostly fall in end Levels 3 or 2;
HBFL8ff8:Good ThyNameIsSkepticism channel link to rather lame HTTPS://IDRLabs.Com/gender/test.php where I got 58% male, 42% female. I'm "Casually Masculine";
HBQL4BIG:Proggit had cool HTTP://CommandLineFu.Com/commands/browse/sort-by-votes && present8ion post recommending introducing complete newbies to your chosen
topic for a couple minutes, then proceeding through a twice practiced live-coding session with big fonts && backup git commits to jump to when getting stuck;
HBQL678P:Also HTTPS://Scrimba.Com for client-side interactive code-casting might be a good resource to learn from when planning Octology coding demonstr8ions.
HTTPS://Developers.GoogleBlog.Com/2017/11/introducing-container-diff-tool-for.html also may prove useful for maintaining eventual Docker containers for code;
HBQLEnet:HTTPS://GamaSutra.Com/view/feature/131577/halflife_and_team_fortress_.php old May 2000 HalfLife networking article could l8r inform my multi-player.
Also HTTP://SolipSys.Co.UK/new/TheMutilatedChessboard.html also has interesting matching problems && myriad other seemingly interesting links to math puzzles.
HTTP://OReilly.Com/data/free/archive.html contains many potentially useful free d8a ebooks regarding Big d8a Science, AI, bots, MachineLearning, && Analytics;
HBRLA5UM:Just paid $10 on my Community1st Visa card (leaving maybe about $40 left?) to take Dr. Jordan B. Peterson's HTTPS://UnderstandMyself.Com Big5Aspects

HBRLFREE:Idea to develop intelligent agents to learn && grow efficiently, gaining more familiarity with increasingly significant models && abstractions based

HBRLHIYa:Shantanu Aryan 8 hours ago U2b posted light goes 299,792,458 HtdXA m/s && 1 s is 9,192,631,770 8Zx6tQ certain raD8ion periods of Cs-133 atom precise;
HBRLJTVH:Earliest 8.txt backup is from Halloween October 31st of 2012 with pt CAVHTTP pre-d8, many months after Dr. Peterson seriously started composing his
"12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos", and February of 2012 that Dad was handed (by his Father) syllabus outline assignment for Personal Development sent;
HC7L1ght:Maybe search for critique (or write my own) of HTTPS://Medium.Com/@francois.chollet/the-impossibility-of-intelligence-explosion-5be4a9eda6ec && note
that interesting topics include basic mut8ions:JAI, GAI, && GBI (as JBlow888's gmz dvl language, General Artificial Intelligence, && Guaranteed Basic Income).
For any future BavL work, note that HTTPS://En.WikiPedia.Org/wiki/Propaedeutic_value_of_Esperanto seems a good path for learning new spoken languages quickly;
HC7L8Ins:RedHeadRedemption recommended CrE8orInsider channel as gr8 resource for if I ever try monetizing Octology demonstr8ion (or some other) videos on U2b;
HC7LIPA8:The International Phonetic Alphabet seems to describe "8" pronunC8ions most commonly as /eɪt/ while my typical Google definitions offer /āt/ instead;
HC9LC6as:Since I gr8ly care to learn about (&& ultim8ly help contribute to any mitig8ion of) every existential crisis our world may face, Vox's new video on
big asteroid threats at HTTPS://YouTube.Com/watch?v=EZSCtgfmEO0 makes me want to study further (even though catastrophic probabilities seem to be quite low).
Rel8dly, U2b has several "Ways the World Could End" videos I should study, in order to best prioritize areas for further research (but AI seems likely gr8st).
Ideally, humanity will be able to develop rL8ively safe GAI soon, which could help limit or resolve the harm posed by almost every other major issue we face.
From HTTPS://HardWare.SlashDot.Org/story/17/12/08/2049204/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-building-dedicated-chips-for-autopilot apparently we're approxim8ly 7 or 8
years from GAI. My intuition is early viral or animalistic (&& thus naive or cruel) AI poses a gr8r threat to other life than likely super-human forms would;
HC9LDON8:With all the backlash about Patreon changing fees on HCI && a good H3H3 Philip DeFranco interview discussing the potentially conflicting perceptions
of it being for don8ions rather than subscriptions && wanting to transition away, maybe I should acceler8 plans to evalU8 the whole crowd-funding competitive
space in order to start fleshing out my own aspir8ions for developing distinctive Octology applic8ions for both "don8" && "p8ron" to particip8 in that arena;
HC9LKhan:HTTPS://YouTube.Com/watch?v=_Lj_diKtrzw is intriguing TEDx talk by MinaKhan on HC8 about MixedReality MathLand to teach math && physics through play;
HCALFMe2:HTTPS://The-American-Interest.Com/2017/12/06/the-warlock-hunt is a totally phenomenal article on #MeToo too far that Dr. Peterson tweeted out today;
HCALKGr8:Just want to note that I have lifted the 888 limit8ion on the list of top 8-words today && begun including many distinct prefixed varE8ions but I am
still generally not crE8ing sepR8 suffix conjug8ions, except when they occupy particularly unique interpret8ions, like "predate", "predator", && "predation".
Regarding future plans to develop some form of ckm8 AI HTTPs://Reddit.Com/r/programming/comments/7i0f8i/deepmind_learns_chess_from_scratch_beats_the_best may
be a good resource to review again. Regarding rel8d GAI safety issue explor8ion for l8r, evalU8 HTTP://Yudkowsky.Net/singularity/aibox experiments thoroughly;
HCCLBDb8:HTTPS://Kialo.Com is a somewhat capable topical deb8 forum with helpful tree-based hierarchical organiz8ion as well as curious radial represent8ion;
HCDLAKP2:KeePass2 USB Keyboard Plugin should let my GalaxyS8 with priv8 d8abase be used to login on any rel8ively untrusted remote machines I can't install2;
HCEL4wrd:HTTPS://Mubaris.Com/2017/12/14/word2vec is my first introduction to a lot of new AI && comput8ional linguistic rel8d NLP (n8ural Language Processing)
concepts && techniques like embedding words as vectors with each having integer forms as well through Google TensorFlow 2-layer NN (NeuralNet) Python library.
It uses a prediction model rather than frequency, analyzing to make w8d guesses through varE8ion 0) CBoW (Continuous Bag of Words) && 1) SkipGram such that
the former predicts words from context while latter predicts context from each word. These result in visualiz8ions nicely conveying clusters of similar words;
HCHLBadA:Recently a tweet from HTTPS://StevenPinker.Com linked to a new article at HTTP://Quillette.Com/2017/12/14/irrational-ai-nxiety/#comment-12120 which
describes the "Value Alignment" issue as a "pseudo-problem". It seems both are unfamiliar with Yudkowski or otherwise uninformed, so I posted a comment there;
HCHLD11a:HTTP://Diiagrams.Com is an interesting interactive site for gener8ing ASCII diagrams from rel8ively intuitive drawing primitives, to stuD l8r for m8.
HTTPS://GitHub.Com/eliukblau/pixterm is a nice tool to render images in true-color monospaced ANSI terminals that include lower-half block Unicode character;
HCHLJBrd:HTTPS://Google.GitHub.IO/boardgame.io may contain code which likely could prove ultim8ly useful for attempting to eventually make ckm8 multi-player;
HCOL8SIG:HTTPS://Medium.Com/incerto/on-neo-cons-and-their-mental-defects-d12685585b11 about interventionistas not having Skin-In-the-Game was linked from /.;
HCOLD8OK:HTTPS://Brilliant.Org/standupmaths may be good weekly puzzle site mentioned from U2b channel video about impossible-to-solve Rubik's Cube form8ions;

HCPLDUPS:HTTP://MAPS.Org is seemingly interesting Multi-disciplinary AssoC8ion for Psychedelic Studies making strong cases for positive MDMA-rel8d therapies;
HCQLIFTo:Mike Lopresti turned me on to the totally awesome dark morbid hilarious anim8ion work of Don Hertzfeldt with his Rejected series of cartoon shorts;
I18L4BCI:HN linked to a basic Economist article on emerging BCI's as BrainComputerInterfaces such as Kochevar's Brain-g8 && ElonMusk's NeuraLink developments.
Also HTTPS://Blogs.ScientificAmerican.Com/observations/a-neuroscientist-explores-the-sanskrit-effect describes how India's mantras improve memory && thinking;
I18LB4E8:HTTP://TheFreeDictionary.Com/words-that-end-in-iate is an obvious discovery demonstr8ing a templ8 for l8r exhaustively expanding my top 8-words list;
I18LDjai:jblow888 shared 3 Month-ish Jai initial release plan && HTTPS://GitHub.Com/BSVino/JaiPrimer/blob/master/JaiPrimer.md rel8s bits of outd8d inform8ion.
Pinker tweeted HTTPS://ArtPlusMarketing.Com/putting-out-the-twitter-trashfire-3ac6cb1af3e rant article by RandiLeeHarper which would be good to study for pr8;
I1BLCB88:HTTP://CarsieBlanton.Com/blog/post/169154246689/the-problem-with-panic is probably the best article about #MeToo and sex in culture I've read so far.
I've also discovered HTTPS://CheekyVideos.Net with rather remarkable Murdoch Murdoch Alt-Right series which caused me to recognize their heralded 14-words of:
"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children." or altern8 slogan: "Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish
from the earth." as well as their coincidental emphasis with 88-precepts as parts of Woltansvolk movement which may have been described by David Lane && then
also Chapter 8 of Mein Kampf being exactly 88-words && the 8th letter being doubled to also stand for the extremely iconic && potent salut8ion: "Heil Hitler".
I also downloaded an MP3 PodCast between Dr. Michael Shermer && HTTPS://ChrisRyanPhD.Com/blog/2014/7/14/what-should-a-sex-show-show which asks good questions;
I1OL8HH8:I clearly see H through Octology as 17th, 5pm, or my eventual shell rather than basic 8th typical letter. Despite the disappointing discovery of the
coincidence that this fundamental 88 pattern interpret8ion also signifies profound internal contradiction against much else that I hoped to do, I find myself
inspired to reiter8 that I am *not* an anti-Semite. I am *not* a Neo-Nazi. I am *not* a knowing participant in any genocidal or authoritarian group of revolt.
Also today, fantasy && science-fiction author (&& good tough-minded feminist?), Ursula K. Le Guin, of popular Earthsea series, passed away at 88 Years of age;
I1OLCmov:HTTPS://GitHub.Com/xoreaxeaxeax has cool movfuscator branchless 7-hour/frame DOOM && sandsifter (maybe genius?) for dealing with Spectre && Meltdown.
Also via HTTPS://GitHub.Com/mjswensen/themer is probably interesting to study, learn from, experiment with, && expand on for Octology color schemes && themes.
HTTPS://GitHub.Com/OculusVR/Flicks also interestingly describes a "flick" as 1/705,600,000th of a second to allow integers to specify most common refresh-r8s.
HTTPS://HackerNoon.Com/why-should-i-learn-android-14687b27e062 may contain compelling advice for porting Octology to Android using Kotlin (rather than Java);
I1QL8uxV:HTTP://DevelopingAndStuff.Com/2015/01/no-mouse.html apparently describes cVim (rather like old Vimper8or?) keyboard-centric control of Google Chrome.
HTTPS://Blog.InsightDataScience.Com/how-to-solve-90-of-nlp-problems-a-step-by-step-guide-fda605278e4e about 15min article on much n8ural Language Processing;
I1RLEASE:Cool thoughts of adding various b8 bar-graph row characters && also current 34? arrayed in 8 joystick directions holding 4 each,with 2 lEst OS omit?
Also octal nested navig8ions from various convertible mappings, && expanding on sS to transform best ANSI eScape codes to term-like mono HTML of all text d8a;
I1ULC1PL:After some deflection to mostly Dr. Peterson rel8d explor8ion in know.ls, I had somewhat more like an epiphany (past Pepe): A purpose of Octology is
to contribute to potential solutions to the "Value Alignment" problems formul8d around General Artificial Intelligence along with plausible God concerns too.
I've copied this purpose line to the top header && maybe it should be made smaller for the README. Showed bug in `8plc f` of double-6 in list && digit counts;
I21LLHit:Added /. link to putr.txt about hard-drive reliability with HGST (HitachiGlobStorTech) better than other WesternDigital (since HGST was bought by WD)
&& with SeaGate in-between. HTTPS://Ask.SlashDot.Org/story/18/02/01/2141205/ask-slashdot-which-tech-company-do-you-respect-most lists LavaBit (SilentCircle),
OpenWhisperSystems (makers of Signal), NextCloud, LibreOffice, Let's Encrypt, GNU, EFF, Tor, && Sonic (ISP) as notably good && trustworthy tech organiz8ions.
Other worthwhile mentions are DuckDuckGo, PaleMoon.Org (web-browser), ProtonMail.Com or FastMail (web-mail), && NearlyFreeSpeech.Net (web-host, fair deals?);
I22L11FS:HTTPS://GitHub.Com/dbkaplun/fse-made-easy contains Python code for efficient Finite-St8-Entropy encoding in ways that Perl might find useful as well.
HTTP://OilShell.Org/blog/2018/01/28.html might have some reasoning to diverge from bash && zsh or description of fE8ures worth exploring for my eventual 8sh.
HTTPS://Reddit.Com/r/programming/comments/7ubtz9/xi_an_editor_for_the_next_20_years_raph_levien discussion might contain details to consider for viii l8r too.
HTTPS://GitHub.Com/jwilm/alacritty (fastest terminal emul8or) mentioned in Xi video is example of how to upd8 text, scroll, && render as fast as GPU is able;
I22LCHAO:HTTPS://En.WikiPedia.Org/wiki/Symbol_of_Chaos is yet another interesting 8 arrows, Symbol-of-Eight, or Chaos-Star origin8ing in stories by Moorcock.
I've begun reading Dr. Peterson's 12 Rules against Chaos && thinking of Kekis. It seems 8 usually symbolizes chaos, but Octology may be ushering in gr8 order;
I23L8PKD:HTTPS://YouTu.be/bbW6ZOmoFgY contains a powerful explor8ion of Philip K. Dick's prescient visions && writings. When I was attending college about 2
decades ago at the University of California at Irvine, a friend named Brian gifted me the book, Valis, which fE8ures a protagonist who is reverber8ingly named
Philip (with just 1 L, also like Philip DeFranco) && while I read through the story, I experienced many supern8ural sens8ions about the synergy between us 3;
I2FLAUGH:8-jokes-hide-in "HydrOgen8"! ;) 8<3 ; I2GLAD2B:Been having cool vision of maybe thE8r and interactive performance visualiz8ion software which may show
a primary probably spectrum-analysis video but the 4 corners can be overlayed with user recording streams for UpperLeft audio (analyzed) or video, UpperRight
detected keyboards, LowerRight trackball or mouse with sub-corners buttons and scrolls, LowerLeft an 8-way joystick with 8 fighting layout buttons to dance on;
I2IL8tab:Of course also eventually want multi-touch && pressure-sensitive tablet supported over or apart from mouse. Multi-mice or all at once seem so cool.
Maybe ov8(ion) instead of thE8r or something more descriptive of "hand-dancing"? Interesting that Paul Julius Moebius described neurology syndrome 1st in 1888;
I2NLFbad:Consider adding de(alloc|salin)8 with some l8 s8n AAA Hah-Sah-tahn (Hebrew) like katana (Nihongo) as probably just `sort -n` alias or some Devil game;
I2QLISJC:After watching a few recent YouTube videos, I feel compelled to recognize Cassie Jaye && Lindsay Shepherd as both seeming so virtuous that they have
become startlingly attractive to me. Of course both are somewhat stereotypically beautiful young women, but they standout well beyond appearance to me since
each presents herself as genuine, courageous, intellectually honest, open-minded, honorable, && exceptionally dignified in approaching many contentious topics
we face in society today. I revere each for their palpable impact on critical contemporary dialog. I aspire to someday attract a woman/wife of their caliber;
I31LBeGd:After contempl8ing && rumin8ing on Peterson, society, conflicts, problems, etc., I have begun formul8ing something like an approach to useful simple
categoriz8ions which may fraction8 further, hopefully either to highlight the most pertinant exceptions, or to delinE8 worthwhile distinctions for sub-groups.
Let me start with the qualific8ion that my primary conception for most levels of analysis are themselves, or almost always lend themselves to be distilled as,
binary divisions. Consequentially, they may initially appear to suffer from both the Black-or-White (A.K.A. Either-Or, False Dilemma/Dichotomy) fallacy as well
as from oversimplific8ion that shrouds critical conditions, caveats, && any seemingly inherent contradictions among available definitions && conclusions which
might be best to draw. The first might be 0/1, no/yes, off/on, false/true, dark/light, Black/White, && Yin/Yang all directly correspond to Chaos/Order as the
archetypal realms which both must be explored for change && growth. Ideally, critical aspects && consequences from them can be navig8d through for cognitive
consider8ion && then competently assimil8d, in sufficiently stable && sustainable sequences of chunks && r8s of change that they script selective journeys for
compounding improvements to be preserved && the success of whatever their evolving structural models shift as, to provide suggestions for how to progress more.
So maybe the next best assoC8ion to make is Female/Male as represent8ionally corresponding mostly with Chaos/Order (but of course there are tons of ways that
one or more women may express Order far more than men within certain contexts, && men might produce more Chaos in some settings). So maybe also circle/str8,
inside/outside, vagina/penis, ovum/sperm, central/satellite, constrict/stretch, beauty/strength, shield/sword, defend/attack, 8/10, etc. before then exploring
tyrant/savior, nemesis/hero, Satan/Y'shua, Mother n8ure/Heaven Father, random/sequenced, evil/good, simple/complex, finite/infinite, && m8riarchy/p8riarchy as
all having intersections of overlap in common && conflicting correspondences for almost all possible combin8ions of dimensions. Then gynocentric/misogynist or
something similar, recognizing that sometimes the most obvious antonyms (like misandry/misogyny) with the conceptual && definitional equivalence among their
opposing meanings are better to neglect in favor of incorpor8ing some altern8ive concept for categorical distinction which offers benefits for some evalU8ion.
So there's both tyrannical && benevolent mother && father figures to convey, each with levels of submissive/dominant, share/provide, spend/earn, dead/alive,
slow/fast, cold/warm, wet/dry, soft/hard, etc. which may indic8 many compelling things about modern Feminism versus Men'sRightsActivists. This can help build
a broad picture about how the absolute && minimal conclusions that all men are privileged oppressors && all women are disadvantaged victims of men (also with
peace/violence, attract/pursue, take/give, hide/show, feel/think, influence/enact, compromise/dict8, emotion/reason, subjective/objective, && enslave/liber8),
maybe it will become easier to illumin8 how there may remain remnants of male dominance hierarchies as well as gynocentrism which all could be revised or
replaced to benefit humanity collectively. Masculinity is not inherently toxic. Neither are all women completely dangerous. It will probably be best to delay
the mention or elabor8ion of the most objectionable dichotomies to assoC8 with generally, so the progression is more persuasive. Delay destroy/build also.
Emphasize that men && women (both on average && individually) express virtues && vulnerabilities that should be accounted for when trying to resolve conflict.

Also rather interesting that before 4 minutes into Paul Elam's 20-minute HTTPS://YouTu.be/fHDmStorikk he recommends DSM IV as less feminist-influenced than V.
Further rel8ing to tactical phases of BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) or Narcissism are devalU8ion/idealiz8ion. Of course many of these differentE8ions
should be downplayed or ignored (especially when they correl8 almost entirely or hardly at all with what is already being analyzed), so maybe constructing an
interactive estim8ion, prioritiz8ion, && integr8ion mechanism would be illumin8ing. HTTPS://YouTu.be/RLRBcjDYCfc is 10mins of JP conveying this as archetypal.
Something fascin8ing that I find myself now contempl8ing is how much overlap there is (or appears to be), on some useful level, between spiritual/physical &&
Chaos/Order. Maybe even the notion of a concept is this predominantly non-physical potential as some iD8ion which materializes within the physical structures
of a mind before gaining the opportunity to become expressed (likely into some linguistic or visual description) as a considerable new manifest8ion in reality;
I39LBlue:JWitnesses (young Yessica && old man?) came to my door this morning to invite me to their Easter event on Saturday, March 31st. It has me wondering
what distinguishes them from any other Christians (in belief or action). I've also been contempl8ing the logical contradictions inherent in almost every
prevalent concept of omnipotence. Maybe it cannot be taken literally, && should instead be something like: "God is so much more powerful than any humanbeing
that it would appear to be effectively unlimited when viewed from any of our limited vantage points." && similar qualific8ions might be approprE8 to describe
omniscience or living eternally. I'm also wondering about what meaningfully constitutes a god (with regards to General Artifical Intelligence). In some ways,
just being capable of powers no human possesses would seem godly, but a simple digital calcul8or or mobile phone easily bests human capacity at comput8ional
tasks, so that should be clearly inadequ8. Suggesting that a god must be capable of everything a typical human can do && then can also do more than any of us
can seem a bit more promising, but may need to be constrained to things we consciously do. If a god of possibly many, or the God of monotheistic religions,
were to exist, how could any such qualities be tested for? I've also thought about being Messiah-like. It may mean going around preaching from the Bible that
the kingdom of Heaven is coming, but probably does not mean going around performing miracles, f8h healing the sick && blind, walking on water into wine, etc.;
I also wonder what consensus gr8 thinkers might be able to deliber8 && come to for sharing working definitions of "truth" && "good", like SamHarris && Dr.JP;
Also, back to thinking about the antonym interactions reminded me of MikeDiamond of the BeastieBoys positing "Darkness is not the opposite of light, it's the
absence of it." but that doesn't necessarily provide useful insight since usually the absence of something is the same as its opposite. It may be easy to
complic8 but whatever is not to the left is probably to the right (except of course the also infinite perpendicular plane holding up, down, forward, && back).
Maybe such conceptual illustr8ion of the n8ure of bifurc8ion in general can illumin8 oversimplific8ions in many ideologies, && particularly of "p8riarchy"
being mainly about domin8ion rather than competence or other potent tr8s of organiz8ion, but maybe also regarding religious concepts which can be analogous.
I also feel inclined to agree with SamHarris that furthering concepts of animal or human sacrifice as offerings needed to pay for sins should be rethought;
Imagining some anim8ion of the fraction8ion of LGBT makes me think Trans-sexual as transitional, while Trans-human means more than human or superhuman instead.
Of course some argue for more than two genders, but seem to do so based on whim, emotion, or maybe sens8ion, but I find no biological basis past hermaphrodite;
I3ALEd8d:HTTPS://YouTu.be/4Cp60nQ8xko is 17mins of BrendanO'Neill talking "Corruption of Political Language" with UK, UN, US war as "peace-keeping", barbarism
as "humanitarian" && many other potent examples of branding for demoniz8ion of Populist && others with "dishonest, destructive, self-interested [term] misuse";
I3ALHEVN:While I think my knowledge is agnostic && my belief is atheist (as considering theism to fail burden of proof), there may exist potent religious &&
theistic aspects to what I also imagine could be. If Jung's "Collective Unconscious" remains an apt explan8ion of ingrained iD8ion of mythology && archetypes,
this may indic8 a form of meta-truths that at least served some historically significant function (which might be rather symbolic, especially in hindsight);

I3JM3JM3:HTTPS://YouTu.be/cb2_UNVRZxw is an interesting 2.5hour SamHarris WakingUp PodCast #119 on Hidden Motives with RobinHanson in which Harris rel8s at
just before 1hour39mins that his first time taking MDMA "Ecstasy" (maybe at 18 years old) opened him up cognitively && emotionally to d8a he had not known;
I3JMBLib:I am currently leaning towards CarlBenjamin's HTTP://Liberalists.Org/principles as a coherent codific8ion of values which best embody my inclin8ion
towards aspects of individualism, egalitarianism, equalism, humanism, rationalism, atheism, agnosticism, materialism, libertarianism, conservatism, capitalism,
traditionalism, && also strongly toward meritocracy, the preserv8ion of freedom of speech, assoC8ion, expression, && religion (explicitly recognizing h8ful,
bigoted, discrimin8ory, or otherwise offensive speech as protected && essential for civilized society to function && for individuals to navig8 successfully
through adversity), while adamantly rejecting any compulsory speech as immoral. I now consider myself a Men's Rights Activist, staunchly opposed to prevailing
forms of feminism && intent on unwinding the pernicious effects of gynocentrism on human biology && culture. I resolve to break my chivalrous habits, to deny
delusional infatu8ion as being innocuous romantic love worthy of cultiv8ion, && to remain unmarried at least until the court system undergoes some radical
transform8ion toward equity && justice for men. I may become willing to someday attempt to pair-bond with a m8ure woman who appears capable of retaining some
form of respectable values, who strives to remain accountable for her actions, && who is committed to dedic8ing herself to our mutual health && fulfillment
throughout our rel8ionship. She would have to be uncommonly honest && reasonable, not prone to violence or vengeance, but demonstr8ing integrity && sincerity.
I would rather remain single indefinitely than to ever suffer partnering again with another woman who exhibits the tr8s of Borderline Personality Disorder or
who otherwise approaches intimacy as a petulant adolescent. I will w8 for the opportunity to invest in any reliable friendship or loving rel8ionship that can
be forged between two adults. Even if we each may embody or aspire to archetypal tr8s && roles that prove workable within our lives, I will not devolve into
merely some "White Knight" who pledges to loyally serve && protect another tiresome "Distressed Damsel Princess" who swoons on cue only after I do precisely
her bidding. We would have to maintain consider8ion, compassion, && communic8ion with each other in reinforcing patterns to be worthy of lasting commitment.
I will probably never be able to loc8 or attract such a loving adult companion, but solitude && celibacy are far more preferable than settling for malicious.
HTTPS://YouTu.be/53Gmx_wfft8 is a powerful 20-minute Red Pill interview of ErinPizzey by CassieJaye discussing many problems with false accus8ions regarding

I3LMGTOW:I have been voraciously consuming so many gr8 Karen && Paul videos. If I ever try to pair-bond again, define my values, lines-in-the-sand, limits,
boundaries, etc. then lead && finish with them. Calmly && gladly screen out any potential women exhibiting detritus values or Borderline Personality Disorder.
Seek adult/adult rel8ionships && evalU8 capacity for Daddy/Princess trainability toward more intentional matur8ion into stable mutual dedic8ion to balance.
Consider the contradictory/complementary aspects of cherish/admire role dynamics as a useful simple model to frame aspects for health or degener8 ins8iability.
Deny gynocentrism. Resist any instincts, tendencies, habits, or otherwise which might try to lead with dick or heart instead of values. No romantic chivalry.
Affirm unwillingness to submit to a feminine imper8ive for confl8ing mere arousal, stimul8ion, or infatu8ion with the genuine reciproc8ion of love && respect

I3LMM8vl:I think Octology is my codific8ion of my values. It's elabor8 && expanding usually, while 8plc has consolid8d my initial gM8ria stabs at multi-primes.
I probably need to perform more iter8ions of prioritiz8ion of implement8ion consider8ions for further explor8ions, experiment8ions, extrapol8ions, && rel8ions;
I3MMFVAC:After a good nap && getting Darjeeling a bit wild && happy after some rare wet food, I notice that I dreamed of fighting back against someone trying
to steal my sk8board && him being much larger && more powerful than me. Even once I fought well enough to injure him comparably to the damage I had taken &&
also to regain my board such that he committed to fleeing with his gang of smaller friends, he still threw many homing darts toward me, many of which would
intercept my departure && cause immeD8 localized swelling then paralysis in my back, arms, && chest, until I pulled them out && sufficiently worried my hands
around the affected areas enough as I pedaled myself around obstacles returning to my more comfortable arenas. I should buy another sk8 if n8 doesn't return.
I have also been contempl8ing the summariz8ion from Dr. Peterson that the left-hemisphere of the brain is primarily assoC8d with... && thus opposite right

men's therapy without requiring eye-contact or tears, over beers in between Street Fighter bouts or favorite songs or games of ckm8 Chess or 9x9 gom8 Go etc.;
I3OMJxxx:It's pronunC8ion inconsistency for vex8ion && methotrex8 to not split off as UpperCase 'X' PrecursorLetter but kept for tighter PL frequency groups.
Also maybe 8rium && other similar words should be considered as additions with no PrecursorLetters to fall under... like just 8 as ate && eight solitary too;
I3PMGTOW:I've begun watching some videos && reading Rollo Tomassi's r8ionalMale articles, which so far don't seem anywhere near as inform8ive or as useful as
those that are typical from Paul Elam's AnEarForMen, but I learned from usage of 'pablum' as pap, soft baby spoon food, && worthless or oversimplified ideas.
Beyond my continU8ion of explor8ion within Octology to elabor8 on comput8ional expressions && document8ion of my values, I should system8ize them deliber8ly;

"The weakness of men is the facade or illusion of strength && the strength of women is the facade or illusion of weakness." sharing quote by Warren Farrell.
I also find further concepts of hypergamy && n8alism or neoteny worthy of deeper consider8ion && scrutiny towards proactive response. Anna Akana is gr8 too;
