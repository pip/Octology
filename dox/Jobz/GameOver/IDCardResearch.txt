ID Card Research Summary:

  *Note: Price estimates are the cheapest found rounded up a little or 
    question marks if still undetermined.

  If we want to open with inexpensive cards (ie. not smart cards with built-in
processors or proximity cards with Radio Frequency IDs etc.), we can basically
go with either of the older card technologies: magstripes or barcodes.

  Barcodes would require $2k for a card printer, each card would cost 
10cents, && barcode scanners would be employed around the arcade for about 
$100 each.
  Barcodes are much less secure than magstripes because they can be visibly 
copied.

  Magstripes would not require the $2k printer (although they could benefit
from it to print GO logos, usernames, && other personalization onto the 
cards).  The expenses would be a magstripe writer for $800, 
each card would be 20cents, && readers would again be around $100 apiece.
  Special magstripe card printers can encode the stripe && print visible 
info on the cards at once for about $3500.


  The future fully automated ideal seems way too expensive.  Bill-machines 
which are also card reader/writers are only available in solution packages 
&& I haven't been able to get estimated prices on any of those yet but I get
the impression $50-$100k would be normal for the whole deal.  That would be 
all the bill-machines, readers, software, etc. GO would need.  Automatic 
turnstile entry gates would be similarly pricey at around $4k each.  Maybe 
we'd only need 2 of those.

  There are cheap turnstiles which don't lock but count clicks && can send 
the event to a PC.  This PC could alarm if more clicks registered than cards
recognized.  This kind should cost about $1600 while a locking one which can
be triggered to allow passage from admin software costs about $4k.

  Additionally, the general idea of putting money or time onto the cards
is expensive.  It would be better (ie. cheaper) if the cards are merely
identification.  They are printed (&& the magstripe gets encoded)
only once.  From there on, the card is solely identification && the only
equipment needed are readers which send the ID to the network database
for account updating.  This is more secure also since people cannot
tamper with their ID card to do anything but change their identity
(ie. the home card hacker cannot add $1000 or 1000 hours to his card
since the account balance is stored only in our private database).  Of 
course this would also mean that all monetary transactions would be 
manual so it adds employee time / expense but it's still probably much
less than the equipment costs.

Unit costs:
                BarCode  Magstripe  PrintedMagstripe  PrintEncodeSimult
printer           2000                2000              3500
writer                     800         800                   
reader             100     100         100               100
single card           .10     .20         .20               .20
  TOTAL           2100     900        2900              3600
  Assuming we need 3 print/write sets, 8 readers, && 10,000 cards to start:
printers          6000                6000             10500
writers                   2400        2400                   
readers            800     800         800               800
10k cards         1000    2000        2000              2000   
 GRAND TOTAL      7800    5200       11200             13300


  So spend about $5k total for cheapo blank magstripes:
    $800    x      3 = $2,400 reader/writers
    $100    x      8 = $  800 readers
    $  0.20 x 10,000 = $2,000 10,000 blank cards
  or $13k total to include 3 card printer/writers for printed cards.

  They always come with Windows POS software which should be sufficient.

  More research could be beneficial since each of these industries is vast
but this is what I have so far...

Oak Tree Data:

Similar complete card printing systems w/ mag stripe options... maybe a bit
    more expensive than some others above but has interesting web option:
  http://www.oaktreedata.com/ebadge_intro.htm
    where you can just upload images for cards && they ship within one workday
    at $6 each card for 100+.  We can get them w/ mag stripes so we'd only 
    need the encoders... hmm so assuming $3k for a printer && $0.20 / blank 
    card, buying a printer is worthwhile if you need more than 500 cards.

no answer in sales 

*note* we should think about whether we want little barricades for game/spectator 
  zone separation or tall stuff with plastic/glass windows... even sound blocking
  so the spectator zone can be much quieter than the din of entertainment noise.
  Little ones would be easier to store, reconfigure, replace, less expensive...
  but also easier to thwart && wouldn't block sound.  A separate room or tall 
  windowed barricades would be the opposite.  I think the small ones would be best
  unless we have a problem with people hopping or moving them without our notice.
  The above rotocade seems good though... tall && probably heavy but still good.
  There's all kinds of little metal bar ones too.  We should look into these more 
  thoroughly later since they are not as crucial but we might be able to get a 
  deal if we buy the turnstiles && barricades from the same place.
