36H9Lbu - A guess at which tools we'll need for GO && how much we should spend.

Notes: 
  The rubber edging on X-Arcade sticks is probably called "base trim" or
    "insert trim extrusion".  Should be available at McMurray Pacific on
    7th St. in SF off Bryant.
  Some good stuff for a flexible but durable-seeming clear top layer for the
    face of the stick is available at OSH called Crystallite Fiberglass.
    They had 1'x2' for $5 && 3'x4' for $23.  I have not experimented with it
    yet but maybe if it is good, we should get wider base trim to account for
    the added thickness this crystallite adds.
  X-Arcade sticks use 3/4" thick fibreboard for the top panel which holds the
    stick && most buttons.  All remaining walls of the box are 1/4" thick && 
    precisely machine cut... very hard to compete with near-perfect quality 
    utilizing hand tools but a good finish on nice wood which won't warp could
    go a long way towards a finer appearance, texture, && durability.  The 
    exacting process of cutting all the wood so consistently that they all
    fit together very tightly will come with repetition of a good process.
