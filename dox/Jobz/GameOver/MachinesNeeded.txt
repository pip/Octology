DDR Need EXTREME (or 7th mix we already have) + another machine 5th or older.
  Suggested 3rd kv2 (Korean Version 2), 3rd+, 4th+, or 5th.
  4th+ contains 4th Mix JPN +3rdMixSongs +2ndMixSongs +1stMixSongs +ExtraSongs +1stSetKoreanSongs

IIDX has screen light problems (since it's wide projection) that BM3 
  doesn't have.

BM3 THE FINAL is better than 7th Mix... the higher in konami list link, the
  newer && better.
