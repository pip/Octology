Done:
    I examined and tested the dox and current state of code for
     webmail.care.lv for a couple hours.  New accounts are totally
     broken but the one existing one we have to test operated reliably
     for the 15 minutes I waited for responses from their server.

    I met with Julia for over an hour to discuss more thoroughly, the
     state of the art with PnG_Core && _Mindfire databases which are
     crucial to the construction of PnGSites ... like for Expanets
     before Monday =).  Basically Scott knows it better now because he's
     changed so much of the code and procedure.  I've asked him to
     describe it as much as possible and to email me the result before
     Sunday afternoon.

ToDo:
    Come in on Sunday && start->finish Expanets Partners (branches)
     sites in PnGS and test 'em.

    Install the new vid card/hard drive/ && Potato distro next week.

    Install sudo on quark && helium if possible... maybe production too.

    Further determine current hardware specs and assist Nick && Moe in
     making our equipment situation better.

    Keep notes on what I've werked on each day and approximate times
     spent thereon.

    Get a sleeping bag next week in case I need to sleep on the floor
     again... && make sure to bring Beppu-san &&
     Keiferz into the office to say hey to everyone =).

Thots:
    I had fun this week and am excited about my future with MindFire.  I
     really hope I can do a great job and help the company to succeed in
     all it's endeavors and further propagate it's genuine appreciation
     for all employees and clients.  This is totally the kind of company
     I want to werk for... the only way it could be better is if we were
     making video games =).  But it's still the best job I've had yet!
     I really don't want to screw this up.  Back next week.
