Done:
     Hmm... I arrived at the office on Monday afternoon at 2pm.  I slept
    in the office from about 2am until 7am.  Then took a nap again from
    3pm to 5pm.  Now it's after 3:30am on Wednesday.  I'm writing my
    journal and finishing up so I can go.

     I've been getting reacclimated to the nuances of mass database
    population as I've finally began running these import scripts.
    Today I created the records for the ~80 merchants that were included
    in the siteinfo.txt file.  They have been created on Helium and
    Quark.  The scripts and description of my procedure can be found on
    either server in ~pip/dvl/PnGS/*.  I'm aware of how little I really
    know what does what wherewithall the scripts and data etc.
    Hopefully my grasp on the structure and interdependencies will
    continue to solidify respectably.  I abstracted the specific details
    of Expanets' setup process as much as I could so that making a new
    Partner would be less painful.  I'll be able to do this better once
    I have a comprehensive understanding of the steps involved but it
    already feels much better than when I began.

     We had a developers meeting today to discuss responsibilities etc.
    and it appears that my main priority is getting the Locator function
    written and running smoothly with the branch sites and flash
    animation etc.  Thereafter, I'm responsible for specifying the HR
    tool, Press Release Tool, && the rest of the Expanets site.

ToDo:
     Consider Locator && simple configurable crawler/cacher code.

     Spec. future Expanets' site components.

     As soon as Expanets is pacified, we need to get all coders together
    and thoroughly map our process.  That means which projects, what
    interfaces, what data structures, discuss && hopefully resolve
    forking / stability issues.  Consider && agree communally upon a
    staging mechanism / development lifecycle for new project &&
    functionality development from spec through retirement.  Get a real
    team game plan together so we all know where we are, where we're
    going, and how we all thinq we can best get there.  Consider all
    hardware && software concerns.

Thots:
     I can't tell if there's still much code to be written or not.  It
    appears that almost everything is coming together, we just need to
    keep the reigns under control so that everyone is moving in more
    similar directions.  I can't see much functionality or haven't
    encountered discussion (other than Julia's recommendation that PnGC
    gets rewritten entirely) that would suggest that the current
    projects need to do much more than they already do.  Maybe they
    could be rewritten partially in order to attain better efficiency /
    performance.  Hopefully we can consider some potential benchmarking
    mechanisms as well.  I'm ready to take another nap on the couch for
    a little bit.  Beppu's already ganked my spot in the corner. =)
