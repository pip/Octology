Stuff done:
    Went over more PnGC stuff

    Julia explained some of the procedure to create new PnGC sites like
     the database fields and common Dfalt values for certain potentially
     cryptic fields.  She gave a vague description of differing
     API_version(s) like MerchantTrust (MT), LinkPoint (LP), && PayReady
     (PR) which each need different fields.  Apparently LinkPoint is the
     most difficult or most valuable for instruction because Julia
     ignored the other version types.
    *NOTE* it seems verSion is spelled verGion in the table.
        -Each new merchant gets their own database.
        -Important table for the scripts in each db is order_process.
        -Code in /var/www/cgi-bin/PnGC/plugin/Cart/ on quark
        -Each merchant gets a .pem file in $path/LinkPointAPI/certs/
        -All changes must be done to live database
        -No data staging && testing can be done on helium (Why not?)

    Julia wanted me to make seiko.pem according to the above stuff.  She
     didn't mention that she needed it immediately because it was
     supposed to be done by the end of the day (which was less than an
     hour from our meeting).  She ended up doing it since I was unaware
     of the time sensitivity and unable to complete it before 5pm.

    Julia emailed me the tab-delimited file for Expanets && a
     description of the manual method for creating new PnGS sites.

    I tried to grok her mail && find a script to pattern my database
     manipulations after.

    I got a key and lerned the security code today. =)

ToDo:
    Get right database info && procedures for Expanets site making
     (mk_sites.pl).

    Lern and code the site maker right... && test

    Keep logging this journal && try to come in by noon every day...
    I thinq I can, I thinq I can... =)

Thots:
    I'm not sure if Julia is just too stressed to be very helpful but
     she seems to answer a lot of my questions with "you can't do that"
     or "you must lern that on your own" and nothing more.  Since she is
     the main person whom I've been in contact with so far and probably
     the main person I should be trying to relieve stress and
     responsibility from, these answers make it significantly more
     difficult for me since there doesn't seem to be much help elsewhere.

    I hope I can design and code something big soon.  This is where I
     feel I'm most capable && experienced.  I could probably oversee
     projects to an extent but I've never been responsible for such a
     situation so I'm not sure how easily I'd be able to handle it.
