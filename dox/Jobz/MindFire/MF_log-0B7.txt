Done:
	Installed Debian and compiled apache w/ mod_perl with Beppu
		
	Moved offices.

	Republished the sites (I don't know why this had to be done as Ray
		did it successfully last night AFAIK) with 
		/var/www/PnG.sys/cgi-bin/PnGS/bin/publisha.pl
		on Quark...
		
	Fixed the pseudo bullets "*" so that each is preceeded by a single 
		newline (\n) character
		
	Duplicated all the ImageFile entries that had been submitted only for
		denver to all other merchants with the correct imglib_id
	
	Tried to figure out why Dfalt imgz aren't appearing for non-denver	

ToDo:
	Get X to werk on my machine... 640x480x4bpp (16 colors! blech) 
		isn't sufficient to examine the websites we are werking on.
		More than 64MB would be particularly helpful for a smoothly
		running X as well.
		

	Determine what else is necessary so that all merchants can see gfx
		like denver...

	Figure out how to get denver.expanets4me insted of /denver
	
	Dsine this little jrnl forum && imp it =).
	
	Clean && test mk_sites.pl and then polish README && email it to DaveR
		so's we can have a thorough step-by-step to make a new Sites Partner.
		
	Hit up Ray for all the necessary info to do the same thing for PnGF.
		ie. mk_frame.pl && README

	Hopefully Dsine some semblance of SoupRaddMinn w/ Yulia, Ray, && 
		Scott so's we can all figure out how to provide a simplified
		new product deployment mechanism... ie. Christi should login
		to some site on Helium and fill out fields for a new partner
		or upload a file for the definition && merchants and... voila!
		=)  It would be nice.
	
	clicktime && more jrnl entries =)  Sorry I've been lagging...

Thots:
	I'm getting sorta self-conscious about living at the office.  Maybe
		I should ummm like go home sometimes.  I like blasting tunes && 
		haX0ring a new Debian distro tho =).
		
	Whoa!  I've gotta go vote for HarryBrowne.org today!  I hope he wins
		the whole darn thing.
		
	I'm excited about werking more closely (literally) with Ray in the
		future.  Hopefully I can grok the Framewerk before I delve into
		the major codes for Sites && Commerce && ...  lots to get familiar
		with.
		
	I've never really been part of a genuine programming team so I'm 
		eager to succeed and deathly afraid I'll suck nutz.  I hope we
		can all werk hard together to complete our projects efficiently
		&& excellently.
