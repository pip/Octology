Pip's Journal: A-24-0

Stuff done:
 DaveR, Christi, Julia, && I met to consider the Expanets situation and
 what sorts of changes may lie ahead for PnGC (&& S).  Initially, PnGS
 will be deployed for the 127 different branches (by Mon,A30).  It seems
 that PnGC may need to be substantially augmented or
 respec'd/designed/coded to satisfy (by B15?).  Product catalog is a
 major component which needs much attention.  Others less clear.

 Discussed PnG(C&&S) w/ Julia.  Considered some of the poor algorithms /
 redundant calculations currently being employed with mind for recoding.
 Too-many-hands-in-the-cookie-jar problem has Julia pretty irked about
 the code managability and extensibility (and even it's usefulness now).

 Began this Journal.

 Read the coding procedures && CVS dox (from Scott)... and got CVS to
 let me checkout stuff etc.

 Looked for some auto-testing code (which Julia said is needed).
 Haven't found anything worthwhile yet.

 Briefly discussed current and potential future hardware configurations
 for servers with Moe && Ray.

ToDo:
 Find and know any specs/dox/design notes for latest PnGC.

 Better determine problems/needs/wishes for current or new PnGC.

 Examine Dell/IBM/Cisco/etc. sites for MindFires on how to make PnGC
 more like the big boys (if not better).

 Find or write some testing code to ensure that Apache/MySQL are
 correctly serving a large number of our PnGSites automagically and
 potentially hitup forms too.

 Need to meet with Moe && Ray to more seriously and carefully consider a
 future plan for server equipment configurations etc.

Thots:
 I really like the people and environment here.  I hope to do great werk.

 I'd like to better understand what our separate projects are supposed
 to do and how well they succeed at their respective tasks.  I don't
 quite grasp where PnGF ends and C && S && ?... begin.  Additionally, if
 PnGS is generally the interface (and configurator) for PnGC, how much
 of (ie. what functionality of) PnGS is required for PnGC to operate
 correctly?

 ... What are all the PnG products and what's their primary purpose?
 How successful are the current developments underway on each project in
 achieving that purpose?

 I really don't know if PnGC needs to be rewritten from scratch just to
 have less bugs and handle catalog stuff better.  Apparently Julia was
 it's primary developer and she's gung-ho to have it redone so I'll keep
 that in mind but doing so and meeting a deadline in less than three
 weeks could be nearly impossible.

 I need a key so I don't get kicked out of here every night by the last
 person to leave =).  Christi's kicking me out.  TTFN.
