Done:
	Fixed Expanets sites w/ Ray && Scott
	
	Werked more on && tested mk_sites.pl so that Expanets could be 
	 fully recreated from it.
	 
	Described the process more completely
	
	Considered further Expanets corporate site solutions
	
	Enabled HTML::Mason for use with mod_perl as a development
	 environment for the beginnings of SoupRaddMinn
	 
	I'd like to do the forum && Expanets Dell-like Job Listing
	 section with Mason if possible too as it'd probably be 
	 ideal for such tasks (except that it's not configured on
	 our live server yet).
	 
	I ordered O'Reilly's mod_perl book so that I can get smart

	Configured my werkstation further && described deficiencies
	 to Nick for potential remedies
	 
ToDo:
	Read more on Mason && code some stuff up!
	
	clean up krip (C mesg client), finish it done! (or at least
	 good enuf until later =) )
	 
	Bgin SoupRaddMinn, && Forum
	
	Grok PnGF
	
	Walk lightly around Yulia

Thots:
	Yulia said that she doesn't like or want to werk with me 
	 today.  I don't mean to be a poop if indeed I am.  I
	 know I'm often ridiculously optimistic but... well...
	 what am I supposed to be?  I'm not trying to be a
	 stool sample, I'm just trying to be as helpful && 
	 useful && productive as I can be.
	 
	Anyways, I still feel like a loose wheel.  I'm trying
	 to get a coherent game plan ... I mean team plan for
	 the future of MindFire but every coder is pretty happy
	 with their own isolated projects:
	 	Ray->  F
	 	Scott->S
	 	Yulia->C
	 	Me->   nothing!  I suck!
	 I thinq we all need to fully understand and finish F.
	 That as a foundation, we could then polish S while 
	 migrating C functionality over to S style editing etc.
	 for catalog pages and the like.  If we were all on the
	 same page with this stuff, I don't thinq it would be
	 so hard to get a comprehensive tool up by which 
	 Christi || DaveR could take a spreadsheet, a mockup,
	 fill out a few fields and check the right boxes and 
	 easily and calmly deploy a new S or C partner with 
	 little agony.  This would be sweet.  Well I've gotta
	 get on.  I'll likely be back on Sunday evening.
	 TTFN.
