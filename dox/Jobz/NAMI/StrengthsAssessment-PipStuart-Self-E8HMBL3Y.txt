PipStuart's Self Strengths Assessment:
Current (talents, skills, personal && environmental);  Desires && Aspir8ions (What do I want?);  Past Resources-Personal,Social,&&Environmental (used past?);
Home/Daily Living
  Current:I've had a stable living situ8ion in a comfortable 2 bedroom apartment for almost 1.5 years at 2520 Honey Lou Ct. #103 in Appleton. I mainly enjoy
    living alone with my beloved cat. My place is affordable. I have nice neighbors. It's a short walk to the Copps grocery store. Also pretty close to my
    therapist. Thankfully much farther from the loud trains (which blasted && shook my previous place).
  Aspir8ions:I would someday like to rent a house with a garage again. After that, I'd like to buy my own house back in Southern California.
  Past:The best living arrangement I've had so far was renting a 3 bedroom house with a garage, backyard, and jacuzzi with good friends in Northern Cali.
    Although my previous place was small && had many other shortcomings, I was able to live there for almost 3 years which was an important recovery stage.
Assets-Financial/Insurance
  Current:I receive adequ8 SSDI that amounts to almost $9/hour if I'm earning it full-time. I receive $15 monthly FoodShare. Medicare is my insurance that
    corresponds with my SSDI. My mom has been my payee since I began receiving benefits in 2010.
  Aspir8ions:I aspire to gradually take over control && responsibility for all of my income && expenses again.
    I would like to work part-time again (either as a software developer or a Certified Peer Specialist) to earn initially less than $1070/month so
    that months don't start counting up to 9 of "substantial income" months that will disqualify me for further SSDI. Eventually I'd like to work full-time
    again && get off Disability when I hopefully will no longer need it. I would like to start developing compelling mobile applic8ions first on Android for
    low prices to establish && grow my own sustainable personal software company. It might be cool to also make money on the side betting on Poker or Chess.
    I'd like to be able to afford to eat at good vegan restaurants with some frequency. I'd like to build some savings.
  Past:My last highest salary prior to my hospitaliz8ions was $110K/year.
Employment/Voc8ional/Educ8ional/Specialized Knowledge
  Current:I'm doing rel8ively well in NAMI's Peer Specialist Training course. I regularly conduct self-directed study of software development issues online.
  Aspir8ions:I aim to become a capable Certified Peer Specialist focused on strengths-based recovery for myself first && then also for others I might help.
    I want to progressively demonstr8 that I can perform productive pay-worthy work again, either as a Certified Peer Specialist or programmer or both.
  Past:I made a respectable living for most of the years before my public Bipolar episodes, doing work which I heartily enjoyed, mainly designing && making
    videogame development tools. I possess a long history of experience with computer hardware && software problem solving.
Supportive Rel8ionships
  Current:I totally enjoy playing Chess with at least one encouraging friend almost every week. I have fun playing videogames with friends when I can too.
    My family is very supportive of all of my progress && achievements.
  Aspir8ions:I aspire to become able to provide meaningful support to others regularly, rather than mainly being the recipient of support.
  Past:I used to have many close && positive friendships back in California, that I may become better able to rekindle && revive somewhat.
    I also attended NA meetings for a while a couple years ago, which were somewhat helpful to me at the time.
Wellness/Health
  Current:I take Olanzapine "Zyprexa" Bipolar medic8ion daily. I see my very helpful therapist every other week. I ride my bicycle && sk8boards regularly.
