Subject: Re: Pip Stewart Confirmation: Interview at Yahoo! on Thursday, October 22, 2009

Hello Jennifer!

I acknowledge receipt of your e-mail but you don't have me there at
Yahoo! yet, so hopefully we all *will* be pleased when we're able to
coordinate more successfully so that I *can* be there to interview for
the Software Development Engineer position. *Note:* I'm not playing with
your literal message to be snide or inflammatory. It's more meant as
cathartic levity to preface explanation of likely minor miscommunication
or oversight resulting in ill-preparedness. Please don't take me to be
resentful or disparaging towards anyone. Just grant me a bit of cynicism
when relating something to the effect of: "Umm, yeah, this plan sounds
nice and all but don't we have some unmet dependencies to iron out
first, or did I miss the memo?"... especially when *I* am the overlooked
subject!

It looks like we're needing to re-schedule since I haven't received my
itinerary yet. I'm down in Venice, California at the moment (rather near
to LAX), so it's seeming increasingly unlikely that I'll be able to make
my own way up to Sunnyvale since I do not presently own a motor-vehicle
(nor have I received any clear indication that I should be arranging my
own transportation until now, with less than 18 hours to do so). At
least parking shouldn't be much of a problem for me. ;)  Seriously, I
would get up there tomorrow if I could, but I don't have any clear
options here at the 11th-hour and I've fallen a bit ill today too, so
let's please try again Thursday of next week (October 29th, 2009), or
some other available day that I can find sufficient transportation for
(which Yahoo! may still arrange for me, hopefully with a couple days
notice to avoid another misstep like this).

I've pasted my recent e-mails with Michelle and Matthias below your
message for your perusal. Please let me know what we can coordinate more
effectively together ahead. Thanks.

Sincerely,
-PipStuart
P.S. My surname is like juxtaposing "ArtStudent", rather than sulking,
worrying, or brooding over the culinary critique of slowly cooked
vegetables, meats, and broth... also just FYI. ;)

Subject: Re: Hi!

Hello Michelle and Matthias,

I just wanted to notify you both that I have not yet received flight
itinerary details if I am to interview with you up in Sunnyvale
tomorrow. Should I be expecting these later today or would it be better
for us to re-schedule for maybe next Thursday, October 29th, instead of
tomorrow?

I'd like to reiterate that I'm very interested in this position and, as
much as I've been enthusiastically anticipating tomorrow becoming a
smooth and successful interview, I'm afraid I'm coming down with some
kind of bad chest-cold today and I wouldn't want my congested coughing
to be transmitted to others or to obscure my professional
qualifications. So I'd be glad to reschedule to give us both at least a
few more days of preparation, or if everything is already lined-up and I
just haven't been informed of the specifics yet, but will be receiving
them with enough time to coordinate my side of things to meet the
schedule, well then I remain glad to do all I can to arrive up there as
healthy, clear-headed, and on-time as is feasible. Just let me know when
you can.

Thanks very much. I look forward to hearing back from you and enjoying a
mutually productive interview ahead (whether that be tomorrow or some
other date shortly thereafter).

Sincerely,
-PipStuart (949)433-4243
