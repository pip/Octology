received a 5pm e-mail from another Talent Acquisition Coordinator
named  : "Jayme     Esperanza "     <Jayme@Yahoo-Inc.Com>
to let me know that they've booked me an American flight tomorrow
morning at 7:20am out of LAX. Sheesh! Not much notice... && the
"me" there is actually "Philip Stewart" but hopefully things will
work out just fine... somehow. Yes. Somehow! If not through this
disheveled Yahoo! hiring process, then some other fine way. Yes. =)

Hello, ... hello? -- Is this thing on?

I'm sorry to have to disrupt the shuffle that I've been lost in here
but who am I supposed to be dealing with now to schedule an interview?

It would make some sense for everyone to keep assuming that Michelle
has it in-hand, however I have not seen a single response from her
since Friday, October 16th of 2009 at 19:24, when she sent:

  Subject:Hi!
  So I just want to give you a heads up that we are working with
  Thursday, October 22nd, 2009 for your interview J Thanks!

  michelle

I expect you all to be very busy but could someone at least please
respond to let me know who I should be coordinating with in Michelle's
absence? Connie did call me two weeks ago with some urgency to work
out an interview date with Michelle. I'd call her (in case phones
would prove superior to e-mail in this circumstance) but the number
has been flushed from the queue of my call-log (and may have been
devoid of crucial extension detail anyway), so I'm not even sure
who to try to call either. If you can, please help. =)

Thanks. I've pasted my response to Michelle's Travel Questionnaire
here at the bottom of our thread too, in case that would prove useful
to another coordinator (or finding an appropriate one).

Sincerely,
-Pip

  Hello Jennifer!

  I acknowledge receipt of your e-mail but you don't have me there at
Yahoo! yet, so hopefully we all *will* be pleased when we're able to
coordinate more successfully so that I *can* be there to interview for
the Software Development Engineer position. *Note:* I'm not playing with
your literal message to be snide or inflammatory. It's more meant as
cathartic levity to preface explanation of likely minor miscommunication
or oversight resulting in ill-preparedness. Please don't take me to be
resentful or disparaging towards anyone. Just grant me a bit of cynicism
when relating something to the effect of: "Umm, yeah, this plan sounds
nice and all but don't we have some unmet dependencies to iron out
first, or did I miss the memo?"... especially when *I* am the overlooked
subject!

  It looks like we're needing to re-schedule since I haven't received
my itinerary yet. I'm down in Venice, California at the moment (rather
near to LAX), so it's seeming increasingly unlikely that I'll be able to
make my own way up to Sunnyvale since I do not presently own a
motor-vehicle (nor have I received any clear indication that I should be
arranging my own transportation until now, with less than 18 hours to do
so). At least parking shouldn't be much of a problem for me. ;)
Seriously, I would get up there tomorrow if I could, but I don't have
any clear options here at the 11th-hour and I've fallen a bit ill today
too, so let's please try again Thursday of next week (October 29th,
2009), or some other available day that I can find sufficient
transportation for (which Yahoo! may still arrange for me, hopefully
with a couple days notice to avoid another misstep like this).

  I've pasted my recent e-mails with Michelle and Matthias below your
message for your perusal. Please let me know what we can coordinate more
effectively together ahead. Thanks.

  Subject: Re: Hi!

  Hello Michelle and Matthias,

  I just wanted to notify you both that I have not yet received flight
itinerary details if I am to interview with you up in Sunnyvale
tomorrow. Should I be expecting these later today or would it be better
for us to re-schedule for maybe next Thursday, October 29th, instead of
tomorrow?

  I'd like to reiterate that I'm very interested in this position and,
as much as I've been enthusiastically anticipating tomorrow becoming a
smooth and successful interview, I'm afraid I'm coming down with some
kind of bad chest-cold today and I wouldn't want my congested coughing
to be transmitted to others or to obscure my professional
qualifications. So I'd be glad to reschedule to give us both at least a
few more days of preparation, or if everything is already lined-up and I
just haven't been informed of the specifics yet, but will be receiving
them with enough time to coordinate my side of things to meet the
schedule, well then I remain glad to do all I can to arrive up there as
healthy, clear-headed, and on-time as is feasible. Just let me know when
you can.

  Thanks very much. I look forward to hearing back from you and
enjoying a mutually productive interview ahead (whether that be tomorrow
or some other date shortly thereafter).

  Sincerely,
  -PipStuart (949)433-4243

That sounds great! Matthias and I both seemed to heartily enjoy our
phone-interview last week and I'm completely interested in getting
hired into this position if things continue to go as well, since the
details so far suggest I'm dashingly well-suited for it, both
experience and interest-wise. Yay! =)

I'm wrapping up the final touches on my prior contracting project this
week (having submitted the completed code for approval this morning),
so I expect to be entirely unrestricted in availability for the
upcoming weeks, beginning next Monday, October 19th. Scheduling
anytime from then on should be free of conflict for me.

> Will need a hotel?
I think that depends predominantly on whether the 4 interviewers are
particularly likely to be able to accommodate, and adequately utilize,
the estimated 3.5 hours in between flights and shuttles on a single
day. If a night's stay at a nearby hotel wouldn't be too problematic
to arrange, and there's opportunity and any potential benefit to be
gained from permitting our interviews to dynamically and intentionally
run somewhat longer than had been initially anticipated, then in that
case I would certainly appreciate the added flexibility and diminished
pressure associated with the inclusion of such padding (or a "buffer")
being worked into the schedule. I hope you don't mind that I'm
inspired to wax geekily a bit further on this. We programmers tend to
have a heightened sense of reverence for being afforded abundant
capacities, especially when the premature exhaustion of these
crucially limited resources (which are typically metered communally
with prior reservations serving as a prevalent prerequisite for
impending allocations to be granted with exclusivity to a petitioner
or requisitioner) is known to cause the entire process to require
costly resetting after having achieved only partial, and therefore
inconclusive (or worse yet, degenerate, incoherent, and deleterious)
computational results.

To keep from getting swept out to sea by the undercurrents of my
exposition here, let me start over on this question with a direct
answer.

No, I won't *need* a hotel. I'd appreciate a night in any conveniently
situated one though, to help relax the interviews

> If yes, is there a preference?
No.
> Hotel membership number:
N/A

> Will need a rental car?
No. Shuttle-vans or taxi-services should suffice.
> If yes, is there a preference?
N/A
> Rental car membership number:
N/A

> I look forward to hearing from you!
Thank you. Connie called me an hour or two ago, while I had been
engrossed in drafting this message. I affirmed my interest in this job
opportunity and related that I was amidst the composition of my
response to your message as I received her call but that I expect to
be free to arrange an interview anytime from next Monday, October
19th, onward. She related an eagerness to get me up there and asked
that I finish sending you my information so we can proceed quickly
ahead. Thanks for exercising any patience you've extended here to my
response too.

Now it has again become my turn to look aspiringly forward to hearing
from any of you, Connie, or Matthias again soon. Be well.
