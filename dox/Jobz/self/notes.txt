  As of 3BD22hd, there are ads on CraigsList.org for wiring jobs for $1/ft. or
hourly or per job.  Belkin is the highest-profile cable company I know of &&
they have bulk cat5e 1000ft spools for $200 at:
    http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatSectionView.process?IWAction=Load&Merchant_Id=&Section_Id=523
  Less reputable companies sell cheaper spools for as low as $55 including 
shipping at:
    http://www.PriceWatch.com
    http://www.ibuyernet.com/search.html?str=cat5e+1000ft+bulk
 could be good business =)
