Su: Re: Do you know of anyone for these new open positions?

Hi Oscar,

Thanks for contacting me. I'd really like to land a good job again soon (probably best in Senior Tools Programming or Senior Technical Combat Designer). Please check out:

  HTTP://Pip.LBox.Org/Resume

... && feel free to save && print your own local copies or to other formats if you want those. Then if you remain interested in helping me find the highest quality game-development opportunities, please reply to this e-mail && we can arrange for a phone chat && stuff to coordinate. I've hit on such hard financial times that unfortunately both of my old phones (the numbers on my resume) are currently lacking service due to non-payment, but I should be able to borrow a roommate's or friend's phone to try to put some "irons in the fire" with you && GameRecruiter.Com that could hopefully precipitate some promising interviews nearby to where I'm staying in Venice here for now. I might get booted out of my room into homeless again kinda soon since I haven't been able to earn any money so I don't have February's $700 rent yet (with nobody willing to help loan it to me either, so far). It'd be rad to put something kind together.

Thanks mucho, dude! =)

Peace,
-Pip
P.S. I'm fucking dying for a cigarette, having run out of them && cash yesterday. Broke && smokeless suxx0rz! ;(
