            <ul>
              <li><p class="western"><u>Asset Management: SkeletonMatcher</u>.
                Wrote a utility which isolated and reported discrepancies between models in 3DStudioMax after exporting to Collada and Havok. This enabled
                developers (primarily technical artists) to quickly identify any mismatches (and to do so simultaneously among an arbitrary number of
                models) so they could be corrected to run smoothly through the asset-pipeline into the cross-platform game-engine for consistent rendering.

                The <a href="HTTP://Search.CPAN.Org/perldoc?PAR">Perl ARchiving toolkit</a> was used to deploy standalone Win32 executables so artists,
                programmers, and designers could use elaborate Perl utilities without concern for any of the associated dependencies
                (i.e., <a href="HTTP://ActiveState.Com/Products/activeperl">ActiveState</a> Perl interpreter installation, external module configuration,
                shell environment setting, etc.).
                [Perl, PAR, CygWin, dmake]</p></li>
              <li><p class="western"><u>Art Scripting: LevelEditor</u>.
                Designed and prototyped a level-editing script in 3DStudio's MaxScript which enabled designers to paint down swaths of locators with
                designations as spawn-points, particle-emitters, sound-effects, etc.. This utility informed the tools team of the capabilities of
                MaxScript and its potential fitness for all projects' level-editing purposes when compared to the alternative compiled plug-in architecture.
                [3DSMaxScript, Vim, Perl, C++]</p></li>
              <li><p class="western"><u>Syntax Highlighting: MaxScript.Vim</u>.
                Developed an intricate syntax color highlighting file containing several custom regular-expressions to match MaxScript's syntactic
                idiosyncrasies and thousands of keywords split among logical token categories to streamline MaxScript coding for 3DStudioMax9 from within

              <li><p class="western"><u>Automation: ChopData</u>.
                Created a general utility to partition large data-files and their corresponding processing operations heuristically. ChopData resolved
                silent unpredictable crashes of 3DStudio during exhaustive batched asset-exports by accepting maximum thresholds for file-count, running size, and component data elements (e.g., too many memory-leaking locator-nodes
                encountered) which designated when the underlying processing application should be clean-slated with a fresh invocation of its executable.
                [Perl, PAR, 3DSMaxScript]</p></li>
              <li><p class="western"><u>Exporting: Max2ColladaHavok</u>.
                Designed and implemented a single unified MaxScript to consistently and coherently supplant a disorderly array of batch files
                and scripts that had previously automated asset-exporting into Collada and basic Havok files. This replacement supported several new
                Havok behavior exporting options through an elegantly unified interface and printed out detailed diagnostics for improved conflict-resolution.

              <li><p class="western"><u>Configuration Management: GenerateHavokConfigs</u>.
                Designed and developed a generation utility to handle a combinatorial explosion of Havok configuration files varying along three
                independently growing axes:</p><br />

                </ul><p class="western">
                The developers who had been manually constructing and maintaining the proliferation of all these variations became quickly mired in a
                level of confusing data-redundancy which this single templated generation solution handily alleviated.

              <li><p class="western"><u>Version Control System</u>.
                Developed a plan for transitioning the studio towards more scalable revisioning practices (including decentralized
                distributed systems). Since the company was coordinating development between three studios which were time-zones apart (California, Utah, and
                Taipei), extensive manual integrations (and "reverse integrations") were constantly undertaken among diverse projects and branches. My
                careful analysis of the conditions and evaluations of the latest in DVCS technologies resulted in a compelling resolution plan.

                The ongoing development for BCGE should see the porting of game logic from Perl to Python and C++ as well as the construction of both 2D and 3D
                (i.e., Gamebryo) clients which are alternate renditions of identical underlying client-side game-state mediated through network traffic which
                remains consistent irrespective of client-side variations in rendering.  There are also designs to implement subsets of more advanced games
