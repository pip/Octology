Part-Time GNU/Linux Perl Programmer (Oshkosh, Wisconsin)

Do you know someone near Oshkosh or Appleton who runs Ubuntu or another popular GNU/Linux distribution and would like any sort of Perl software to be prototyped, modified, or maintained?

I am offering such programming services for $16 per hour and am willing to work up to 10 hours per week on any suitably worthwhile projects (Open-Source and videogame related would be preferred).

You can evaluate some of my latest capabilities at HTTPS://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology and then let me know if you have any small projects or system administration tasks in mind to have developed.

Thank you for your consideration.
