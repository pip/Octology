99FIx00-99FJD80(Tue Sep 15 18:59:00:00  6:59:00pm - 19:13:08:00  7:13:08pm[dur8n14m:08s] 2009): Reconnected, we discussed mobile focus-group app. Notes:
Focus groups, participants get free iPhone or other compensation models, push|pull tasks, queries, quotas, points,
give phones to 3 people as test-bed, then pitch to VC's, maybe Google Android easier develop prototype open-source on then transition to BlackBerry && iPhone,
UserStory: IP rep goes to Kraft, asks what they'd like to know: "Where do consumers shop? What catches their eye in the canned-food aisle?", then we produce
  custom survey questions, generate result reports, etc.
  users take pics of products, "Who are you shopping with?", need to interlace information e.g., focus exclusively on 25YO SoCal men;
  BrandX might want exclusive data precisely on target but lots of other data could be gathered in anticipation of selling it beyond just BrandX;
  anonymity like Google, gather points; compensation of $100 / month to user can be sold by Sasha for ~$1000?!
