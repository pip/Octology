=head1 NAME

Graph::Convert - Convert between graph formats: Graph and Graph::Easy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Graph::Convert;
	
	my $graph_easy = Graph::Easy->new();
	$graph_easy->add_edge ('Bonn', 'Berlin');
	$graph_easy->add_edge ('Berlin', 'Berlin');

	# from "Graph::Easy" to "Graph"
	my $graph = Graph::Convert->as_graph ( $graph_easy );
	
	# and back to "Graph::Easy"
	my $ge = Graph::Convert->as_graph_easy ( $graph );

	print $ge->as_ascii( );

	# Outputs something like:

	#                +----+
	#                v    |
	# +------+     +--------+
	# | Bonn | --> | Berlin |
	# +------+     +--------+

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Graph::Convert> lets you convert graphs between the graph formats
from L<Graph> and L<Graph::Easy>.

It takes a graph object in either format, and converts it to the desired
output format. It handles simple graphs (directed or undirected) as well
as multi-edged graphs, and also carries the attributes over.

This enables you to use all the layout and formatting capabilities
of C<Graph::Easy> on C<Graph> objects, as well as using the extensive
graph algorithms and manipulations of C<Graph> on C<Graph::Easy> objects.

=head2 Graph vs. Graph::Easy

Both C<Graph> and C<Graph::Easy> represent graphs, e.g. vertices (or nodes)
connected by edges. These graphs can have (arbitrary) attributes attached
to the graph, nodes or edges.

Both formats can serialize the graph by creating a text-representation,
but unlike C<Graph::Easy>, C<Graph> is not able to create the graph back
from the string form.

There are, however, some slight differences between these two packages:

=over 12

=item Graph

C<Graph> has different representations for multi-edges and simple graphs,
making it somewhat complicated to switch between these two.

It does have an extensive set of algorithms to manipulate the graph, but no
layout capabilities.

C<Graph> does not support the notion of subgraphs (or "groups" as they are
called in C<Graph::Easy>). While you could assign some sort of group attribute
to nodes, this would have no special meaning to the Graph module.

=item Graph::Easy

C<Graph::Easy> uses the same representation for multi-edged and simple graphs,
but has only basic operations to manipulate the graph and its contents.

It has, however, a build-in layouter which can lay out the graph on a
grid, as well the ability to output Graphviz and VCG/GDL code. This enables
output of ASCII, HTML, SVG and all the formats that graphviz supports, like
PDF or PNG.

C<Graph::Easy> supports subgraphs (aka groups).

In addition, C<Graph::Easy> supports class attributes. By setting the
attribute for a class and putting objects (nodes/edges etc) into
the proper class, it is easier to manipulate attributes for many
objects at once.

=back

=head1 METHODS

C<Graph::Convert> supports the following methods:

=head2 as_graph()

	use Graph::Convert;

	my $graph_easy = Graph::Easy->new( );
	$graph_easy->add_edge('A','B');
	my $graph = Graph::Convert->as_graph( $graph_easy );

	my $undirected_graph = 
	   Graph::Convert->as_graph( $graph_easy, { undirected => 1 } );

Converts the given L<Graph::Easy> object into a L<Graph> object.

This routine creates either a simple or a multiedged graph, depending
on whether the input L<Graph::Easy> object is a simple graph or not.

If you want to force the output to be a multiedged graph object, use
L<as_multiedged_graph>.

Forcing the output to be a simple graph when the input is multi-edged
is not supported, as that would require to drop arbitrary edges from
the input.

The optional parameter is an hash ref with options that is passed
to C<Graph->new()>.

Directed and undirected input graphs result automatically in the appropritate
type of C<Graph> object being created, but you can force the creation
of an undirected graph by either passing C<< { undirected => 1 } >> as
option or use L<as_undirected_graph()>.

=head2 as_undirected_graph()

	use Graph::Convert;

	my $graph_easy = Graph::Easy->new( );
	$graph_easy->add_edge('A','B');
	my $graph = Graph::Convert->as_undirected_graph( $graph_easy );

Converts the given L<Graph::Easy> object into an undirected L<Graph>
object, regardless whether the input graph is a directed graph or not.

=head2 as_multiedged_graph()

	use Graph::Convert;

	my $graph_easy = Graph::Easy->new( );
	$graph_easy->add_edge('A','B');
	my $graph = Graph::Convert->as_multiedged_graph( $graph_easy );

Converts the given L<Graph::Easy> object into a multi-edged L<Graph>
object, even if the input graph is a simple graph (meaning there
is only one edge going from node A to node B).

To create a multi-edged undirected graph, pass in C<< { undirected => 1 } >>
as option:

	use Graph::Convert;

	my $graph_easy = Graph::Easy->new( );
	$graph_easy->add_edge('A','B');
	my $graph = Graph::Convert->as_multiedged_graph( $graph_easy, 
		{ undirected => 1 } );

=head2 as_graph_easy()

	use Graph::Convert;

	my $graph = Graph->new( );
	$graph_easy->add_edge('A','B');
	my $graph_easy = Graph::Convert->as_graph_easy( $graph_easy );

Converts the given L<Graph> object into a L<Graph::Easy> object.

This routine handles simple (directed or undirected) as well as multi-edged
graphs automatically.

Multi-vertexed graphs are not supported e.g. each node must exist only once
in the input graph.
