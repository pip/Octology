If you do not understand much of what is written in this document, read the
<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecine" target="_top">Wikipedia entry on telecine</a>.
It is an understandable and reasonably comprehensive
description of what telecine is.
</p><p><b>A note about the numbers. </b>
Many documents, including the guide linked above, refer to the fields
per second value of NTSC video as 59.94 and the corresponding frames
per second values as 29.97 (for telecined and interlaced) and 23.976
(for progressive). For simplicity, some documents even round these
numbers to 60, 30, and 24.
</p><p>
Strictly speaking, all those numbers are approximations. Black and
white NTSC video was exactly 60 fields per second, but 60000/1001
was later chosen to accomodate color data while remaining compatible
with contemporary black and white televisions. Digital NTSC video
(such as on a DVD) is also 60000/1001 fields per second. From this,
interlaced and telecined video are derived to be 30000/1001 frames
per second; progressive video is 24000/1001 frames per second.
</p><p>
Older versions of the <span class="application">MEncoder</span> documentation
and many archived mailing list posts refer to 59.94, 29.97, and 23.976.
All <span class="application">MEncoder</span> documentation has been updated
to use the fractional values, and you should use them too.
</p><p>
<tt class="option">-ofps 23.976</tt> is incorrect.
<tt class="option">-ofps 24000/1001</tt> should be used instead.
</p><p><b>How telecine is used. </b>
All video intended to be displayed on an NTSC
television set must be 60000/1001 fields per second. Made-for-TV movies
and shows are often filmed directly at 60000/1001 fields per second, but
the majority of cinema is filmed at 24 or 24000/1001 frames per
second. When cinematic movie DVDs are mastered, the video is then
converted for television using a process called telecine.
</p><p>
On a DVD, the video is never actually stored as 60000/1001 fields per
second. For video that was originally 60000/1001, each pair of fields is
combined to form a frame, resulting in 30000/1001 frames per
second. Hardware DVD players then read a flag embedded in the video
stream to determine whether the odd- or even-numbered lines should
form the first field.
</p><p>
Usually, 24000/1001 frames per second content stays as it is when
encoded for a DVD, and the DVD player must perform telecining
on-the-fly. Sometimes, however, the video is telecined
<span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> being stored on the DVD; even though it
was originally 24000/1001 frames per second, it becomes 60000/1001 fields per
second. When it is stored on the DVD, pairs of fields are combined to form
30000/1001 frames per second.
</p><p>
When looking at individual frames formed from 60000/1001 fields per
second video, telecined or otherwise, interlacing is clearly visible
wherever there is any motion, because one field (say, the
even-numbered lines) represents a moment in time 1/(60000/1001)
seconds later than the other. Playing interlaced video on a computer
looks ugly both because the monitor is higher resolution and because
the video is shown frame-after-frame instead of field-after-field.

Progressive video was originally filmed at 24000/1001 fps, and stored
on the DVD without alteration.
</p><p>
When you play a progressive DVD in <span class="application">MPlayer</span>,
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> will print the following line as
soon as the movie begins to play:
</p><pre class="screen">
demux_mpg: 24000/1001 fps progressive NTSC content detected, switching framerate.
</pre><p>
From this point forward, demux_mpg should never say it finds
"30000/1001 fps NTSC content."
</p><p>
When you watch progressive video, you should never see any
interlacing. Beware, however, because sometimes there is a tiny bit
of telecine mixed in where you would not expect. I have encountered TV
show DVDs that have one second of telecine at every scene change, or
at seemingly random places. I once watched a DVD that had a
progressive first half, and the second half was telecined. If you
want to be <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> thorough, you can scan the
entire movie:
</p><pre class="screen">mplayer dvd://1 -nosound -vo null -benchmark</pre><p>
Using <tt class="option">-benchmark</tt> makes
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> play the movie as quickly as it
possibly can; still, depending on your hardware, it can take a
while. Every time demux_mpg reports a framerate change, the line
immediately above will show you the time at which the change
occurred.
</p><p>
Sometimes progressive video on DVDs is referred to as
"soft-telecine" because it is intended to
be telecined by the DVD player.
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-telecine-ident-telecined"></a>14.2.2.2. Telecined</h4></div></div></div><p>
Telecined video was originally filmed at 24000/1001, but was telecined
<span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> it was written to the DVD.
</p><p>
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> does not (ever) report any
framerate changes when it plays telecined video.
</p><p>
Watching a telecined video, you will see interlacing artifacts that
seem to "blink": they repeatedly appear and disappear.
You can look closely at this by
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><pre class="screen">mplayer dvd://1</pre></li><li><p>
  Seek to a part with motion.
</p></li><li><p>
  Use the <span class="keycap"><b>.</b></span> key to step forward one frame at a time.
</p></li><li><p>
  Look at the pattern of interlaced-looking and progressive-looking
  frames. If the pattern you see is PPPII,PPPII,PPPII,... then the
  video is telecined. If you see some other pattern, then the video
  may have been telecined using some non-standard method;
  <span class="application">MEncoder</span> cannot losslessly convert
  non-standard telecine to progressive. If you do not see any
  pattern at all, then it is most likely interlaced.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p><p>
Sometimes telecined video on DVDs is referred to as
"hard-telecine". Since hard-telecine is already 60000/1001 fields
per second, the DVD player plays the video without any manipulation.
</p><p>
Another way to tell if your source is telecined or not is to play
the source with the <tt class="option">-vf pullup</tt> and <tt class="option">-v</tt>
command line options to see how <tt class="option">pullup</tt> matches frames.
If the source is telecined, you should see on the console a 3:2 pattern
with <code class="systemitem">0+.1.+2</code> and <code class="systemitem">0++1</code>
alternating.
This technique has the advantage that you do not need to watch the
source to identify it, which could be useful if you wish to automate
the encoding procedure, or to carry out said procedure remotely via
a slow connection.

Interlaced video was originally filmed at 60000/1001 fields per second,
and stored on the DVD as 30000/1001 frames per second. The interlacing effect
(often called "combing") is a result of combining pairs of
fields into frames. Each field is supposed to be 1/(60000/1001) seconds apart,
and when they are displayed simultaneously the difference is apparent.
</p><p>
As with telecined video, <span class="application">MPlayer</span> should
not ever report any framerate changes when playing interlaced content.
</p><p>
When you view an interlaced video closely by frame-stepping with the
<span class="keycap"><b>.</b></span> key, you will see that every single frame is interlaced.
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-telecine-ident-mixedpt"></a>14.2.2.4. Mixed progressive and telecine</h4></div></div></div><p>
All of a "mixed progressive and telecine" video was originally
24000/1001 frames per second, but some parts of it ended up being telecined.
</p><p>
When <span class="application">MPlayer</span> plays this category, it will
(often repeatedly) switch back and forth between "30000/1001 fps NTSC"
and "24000/1001 fps progressive NTSC". Watch the bottom of
<span class="application">MPlayer</span>'s output to see these messages.
</p><p>
You should check the "30000/1001 fps NTSC" sections to make sure
they are actually telecine, and not just interlaced.
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-telecine-ident-mixedpi"></a>14.2.2.5. Mixed progressive and interlaced</h4></div></div></div><p>
In "mixed progressive and interlaced" content, progressive
and interlaced video have been spliced together.
</p><p>
This category looks just like "mixed progressive and telecine",
until you examine the 30000/1001 fps sections and see that they do not have the
telecine pattern.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-telecine-encode"></a>14.2.3. How to encode each category</h3></div></div></div><p>
As I mentioned in the beginning, example <span class="application">MEncoder</span>
lines below are <span class="bold"><strong>not</strong></span> meant to actually be used;
they only demonstrate the minimum parameters to properly encode each category.
</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-telecine-encode-progressive"></a>14.2.3.1. Progressive</h4></div></div></div><p>
Progressive video requires no special filtering to encode. The only
parameter you need to be sure to use is <tt class="option">-ofps 24000/1001</tt>.
Otherwise, <span class="application">MEncoder</span>
will try to encode at 30000/1001 fps and will duplicate frames.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="screen">mencoder dvd://1 -oac copy -ovc lavc -ofps 24000/1001</pre><p>
</p><p>
It is often the case, however, that a video that looks progressive
actually has very short parts of telecine mixed in. Unless you are
sure, it is safest to treat the video as
<a class="link" href="menc-feat-telecine.html#menc-feat-telecine-encode-mixedpt" title="14.2.3.4. Mixed progressive and telecine">mixed progressive and telecine</a>.
The performance loss is small
<a class="link" href="menc-feat-telecine.html#menc-feat-telecine-footnotes" title="14.2.4. Footnotes">[3]</a>.
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-telecine-encode-telecined"></a>14.2.3.2. Telecined</h4></div></div></div><p>
Telecine can be reversed to retrieve the original 24000/1001 content,
using a process called inverse-telecine.
<span class="application">MPlayer</span> contains several filters to
accomplish this; the best filter, <tt class="option">pullup</tt>, is described
in the <a class="link" href="menc-feat-telecine.html#menc-feat-telecine-encode-mixedpt" title="14.2.3.4. Mixed progressive and telecine">mixed
progressive and telecine</a> section.
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-telecine-encode-interlaced"></a>14.2.3.3. Interlaced</h4></div></div></div><p>
For most practical cases it is not possible to retrieve a complete
progressive video from interlaced content. The only way to do so
without losing half of the vertical resolution is to double the
framerate and try to "guess" what ought to make up the
corresponding lines for each field (this has drawbacks - see method 3).
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
  Encode the video in interlaced form. Normally, interlacing wreaks
  havoc with the encoder's ability to compress well, but
  <code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code> has two
  parameters specifically for dealing with storing interlaced video a
  bit better: <tt class="option"> ildct</tt> and <tt class="option">ilme</tt>. Also,
  using <tt class="option">mbd=2</tt> is strongly recommended
  <a class="link" href="menc-feat-telecine.html#menc-feat-telecine-footnotes" title="14.2.4. Footnotes">[2] </a> because it
  will encode macroblocks as non-interlaced in places where there is
  no motion. Note that <tt class="option">-ofps</tt> is NOT needed here.
  </p><pre class="screen">mencoder dvd://1 -oac copy -ovc lavc -lavcopts ildct:ilme:mbd=2</pre><p>
</p></li><li><p>
  Use a deinterlacing filter before encoding. There are several of
  these filters available to choose from, each with its own advantages
  and disadvantages. Consult <tt class="option">mplayer -pphelp</tt> and
  <tt class="option">mplayer -vf help</tt> to see what is available
  (grep for "deint"), read Michael's Niedermayer
  <a class="ulink" href="http://guru.multimedia.cx/deinterlacing-filters/" target="_top">Deinterlacing filters comparison</a>,
  and search the
  <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/mailing_lists.html" target="_top">
  MPlayer mailing lists</a> to find many discussions about the
  various filters.
  Again, the framerate is not changing, so no
  <tt class="option">-ofps</tt>. Also, deinterlacing should be done after
  cropping <a class="link" href="menc-feat-telecine.html#menc-feat-telecine-footnotes" title="14.2.4. Footnotes">[1]</a> and
  before scaling.
  </p><pre class="screen">mencoder dvd://1 -oac copy -vf yadif -ovc lavc</pre><p>
</p></li><li><p>
  Unfortunately, this option is buggy with
  <span class="application">MEncoder</span>; it ought to work well with
  <span class="application">MEncoder G2</span>, but that is not here yet. You
  might experience crahes. Anyway, the purpose of <tt class="option"> -vf
  tfields</tt> is to create a full frame out of each field, which
  makes the framerate 60000/1001. The advantage of this approach is that no
  data is ever lost; however, since each frame comes from only one
  field, the missing lines have to be interpolated somehow. There are
  no very good methods of generating the missing data, and so the
  result will look a bit similar to when using some deinterlacing
  filters. Generating the missing lines creates other issues, as well,
  simply because the amount of data doubles. So, higher encoding
  bitrates are required to maintain quality, and more CPU power is
  used for both encoding and decoding. tfields has several different
  options for how to create the missing lines of each frame. If you
  use this method, then Reference the manual, and chose whichever
  option looks best for your material. Note that when using
  <tt class="option">tfields</tt> you
  <span class="bold"><strong>have to</strong></span> specify both
  <tt class="option">-fps</tt> and <tt class="option">-ofps</tt> to be twice the
  framerate of your original source.
  </p><pre class="screen">
mencoder dvd://1 -oac copy -vf tfields=2 -ovc lavc \
    -fps 60000/1001 -ofps 60000/1001</pre><p>
</p></li><li><p>
  If you plan on downscaling dramatically, you can extract and encode
  only one of the two fields. Of course, you will lose half the vertical
  resolution, but if you plan on downscaling to at most 1/2 of the
  original, the loss will not matter much. The result will be a
  progressive 30000/1001 frames per second file. The procedure is to use
  <tt class="option">-vf field</tt>, then crop
  <a class="link" href="menc-feat-telecine.html#menc-feat-telecine-footnotes" title="14.2.4. Footnotes">[1]</a> and scale
  appropriately. Remember that you will have to adjust the scale to
  compensate for the vertical resolution being halved.

In order to turn mixed progressive and telecine video into entirely
progressive video, the telecined parts have to be
inverse-telecined. There are three ways to accomplish this,
described below. Note that you should
<span class="bold"><strong>always</strong></span> inverse-telecine before any
rescaling; unless you really know what you are doing,
inverse-telecine before cropping, too
<a class="link" href="menc-feat-telecine.html#menc-feat-telecine-footnotes" title="14.2.4. Footnotes">[1]</a>.
<tt class="option">-ofps 24000/1001</tt> is needed here because the output video
will be 24000/1001 frames per second.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
  <tt class="option">-vf pullup</tt> is designed to inverse-telecine
  telecined material while leaving progressive data alone. In order to
  work properly, <tt class="option">pullup</tt> <span class="bold"><strong>must</strong></span>
  be followed by the <tt class="option">softskip</tt> filter or
  else <span class="application">MEncoder</span> will crash.
  <tt class="option">pullup</tt> is, however, the cleanest and most
  accurate method available for encoding both telecine and
  "mixed progressive and telecine".
  </p><pre class="screen">
mencoder dvd://1 -oac copy -vf pullup,softskip 
    -ovc lavc -ofps 24000/1001</pre><p>
</p></li><li><p>
  An older method
  is to, rather than inverse-telecine the telecined parts, telecine
  the non-telecined parts and then inverse-telecine the whole
  video. Sound confusing? softpulldown is a filter that goes through
  a video and makes the entire file telecined. If we follow
  softpulldown with either <tt class="option">detc</tt> or
  <tt class="option">ivtc</tt>, the final result will be entirely
  progressive. <tt class="option">-ofps 24000/1001</tt> is needed.
  </p><pre class="screen">

  </pre><p>
</p></li><li><p>
  I have not used <tt class="option">-vf filmdint</tt> myself, but here is what
  D Richard Felker III has to say:

  </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It is OK, but IMO it tries to deinterlace rather
     than doing inverse telecine too often (much like settop DVD
     players &amp; progressive TVs) which gives ugly flickering and
     other artifacts. If you are going to use it, you at least need to
     spend some time tuning the options and watching the output first
     to make sure it is not messing up.
  </p></blockquote></div><p>
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="menc-feat-telecine-encode-mixedpi"></a>14.2.3.5. Mixed progressive and interlaced</h4></div></div></div><p>
There are two options for dealing with this category, each of
which is a compromise. You should decide based on the
duration/location of each type.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
  Treat it as progressive. The interlaced parts will look interlaced,
  and some of the interlaced fields will have to be dropped, resulting
  in a bit of uneven jumpiness. You can use a postprocessing filter if
  you want to, but it may slightly degrade the progressive parts.
  </p><p>
  This option should definitely not be used if you want to eventually
  display the video on an interlaced device (with a TV card, for
  example). If you have interlaced frames in a 24000/1001 frames per
  second video, they will be telecined along with the progressive
  frames. Half of the interlaced "frames" will be displayed for three
  fields' duration (3/(60000/1001) seconds), resulting in a flicking
  "jump back in time" effect that looks quite bad. If you
  even attempt this, you <span class="bold"><strong>must</strong></span> use a
  deinterlacing filter like <tt class="option">lb</tt> or
  <tt class="option">l5</tt>.
  </p><p>
  It may also be a bad idea for progressive display, too. It will drop
  pairs of consecutive interlaced fields, resulting in a discontinuity
  that can be more visible than with the second method, which shows
  some progressive frames twice. 30000/1001 frames per second interlaced
  video is already a bit choppy because it really should be shown at
  60000/1001 fields per second, so the duplicate frames do not stand out as
  much.
  </p><p>
  Either way, it is best to consider your content and how you intend to
  display it. If your video is 90% progressive and you never intend to
  show it on a TV, you should favor a progressive approach. If it is
  only half progressive, you probably want to encode it as if it is all
  interlaced.
  </p></li><li><p>
  Treat it as interlaced. Some frames of the progressive parts will
  need to be duplicated, resulting in uneven jumpiness. Again,
  deinterlacing filters may slightly degrade the progressive parts.

  Video data on DVDs are stored in a format called YUV 4:2:0. In YUV
  video, luma ("brightness") and chroma ("color")
  are stored separately. Because the human eye is somewhat less
  sensitive to color than it is to brightness, in a YUV 4:2:0 picture
  there is only one chroma pixel for every four luma pixels. In a
  progressive picture, each square of four luma pixels (two on each
  side) has one common chroma pixel. You must crop progressive YUV
  4:2:0 to even resolutions, and use even offsets. For example,
  <tt class="option">crop=716:380:2:26</tt> is OK but
  <tt class="option">crop=716:380:3:26 </tt> is not.
  </p><p>
  When you are dealing with interlaced YUV 4:2:0, the situation is a
  bit more complicated. Instead of every four luma pixels in the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>frame</em></span> sharing a chroma pixel, every four luma
  pixels in each <span class="emphasis"><em> field</em></span> share a chroma
  pixel. When fields are interlaced to form a frame, each scanline is
  one pixel high. Now, instead of all four luma pixels being in a
  square, there are two pixels side-by-side, and the other two pixels
  are side-by-side two scanlines down. The two luma pixels in the
  intermediate scanline are from the other field, and so share a
  different chroma pixel with two luma pixels two scanlines away. All
  this confusion makes it necessary to have vertical crop dimensions
  and offsets be multiples of four. Horizontal can stay even.
  </p><p>
  For telecined video, I recommend that cropping take place after
  inverse telecining. Once the video is progressive you only need to
  crop by even numbers. If you really want to gain the slight speedup
  that cropping first may offer, you must crop vertically by multiples
  of four or else the inverse-telecine filter will not have proper data.
  </p><p>
  For interlaced (not telecined) video, you must always crop
  vertically by multiples of four unless you use <tt class="option">-vf
  field</tt> before cropping.
  </p></li><li><p><b>About encoding parameters and quality: </b>
  Just because I recommend <tt class="option">mbd=2</tt> here does not mean it
  should not be used elsewhere. Along with <tt class="option">trell</tt>,
  <tt class="option">mbd=2</tt> is one of the two
   <code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code> options that
  increases quality the most, and you should always use at least those
  two unless the drop in encoding speed is prohibitive (e.g. realtime
  encoding). There are many other options to
  <code class="systemitem">libavcodec</code> that increase
  encoding quality (and decrease encoding speed) but that is beyond
  the scope of this document.
  </p></li><li><p><b>About the performance of pullup: </b>
  It is safe to use <tt class="option">pullup</tt> (along with <tt class="option">softskip
  </tt>) on progressive video, and is usually a good idea unless
  the source has been definitively verified to be entirely progressive.
  The performace loss is small for most cases. On a bare-minimum encode,
  <tt class="option">pullup</tt> causes <span class="application">MEncoder</span> to
  be 50% slower. Adding sound processing and advanced <tt class="option">lavcopts
  </tt> overshadows that difference, bringing the performance
  decrease of using <tt class="option">pullup</tt> down to 2%.
