CONTACTING JP SOFTWARE
----------------------
   Often the simplest way to learn more about our products, place an
   order, or find the latest updates is to visit our web site at
   http://www.jpsoft.com/.

   You can order most products from the dealer you or your company use
   regularly; if your dealer does not carry the product they can order
   it easily from JP Software.  Our products are available from software
   vendors such as Corporate Software and Technology, Software House,
   and Programmer's Paradise.  See the web site for a complete dealer
   list; also see INTERNAT.TXT for dealers outside the U.S. (Dealers,
   VARs, and consultants, please contact us for reseller pricing and
   terms.)

   Notes On Security of Electronic Orders:
      
      Orders placed via the electronic ordering service on our web site
      are handled by a "secure server".  The server and the electronic
      ordering service are managed by Digital River, a major Internet
      commerce vendor, and are not under our control, but to the best of
      our knowledge they transmit your order in a secure fashion, and
      are as secure as other similar services on the Internet.  Look for
      the security symbol displayed by your web browser to make sure you
      have established a "secure connection" to this service when
      placing your order.

      You can transmit your order to us electronically via CompuServe
      Mail, Internet email, or our web site.  CompuServe Mail services
      are centrally located and generally considered to be quite secure.
      The security of Internet email is almost entirely beyond our
      control, though we have received email orders for years and have
      never experienced any security problems.
      
      If you are still concerned about the security of electronic orders
      please place your order by phone, fax, or mail; or send it
      electronically, include a reliable daytime U.S. or Canadian
      telephone number, and mark "Please call" in the credit card
      section of the form.  We will call you for the credit card number
      when we receive your message.  This service is not available
      outside the U.S. and Canada.


SATISFACTION GUARANTEE
----------------------
   If you are not fully satisfied with a JP Software product you may
   return it at any time up to 90 days after purchase for a refund of
   the full product price (shipping and rush order charges are not
   refundable).

   If you are dissatisfied with a product we sell which is not produced
   by JP Software you may return it for a full refund if in our judgment
   it is complete, is not damaged in any way, and is in resellable
   condition, or a 50% refund if not.

   Please contact us for a return authorization before returning any
   product for a refund.

   This satisfaction guarantee does not apply to multi-system licenses
   for more than 10 computers, or to purchases of more than 10
   individual copies at one time.  [Should you need to evaluate a
   product for a larger purchase, with the option to return it if it
   does not meet your needs, use your downloaded trial copy, or order a
   small license first (small licenses are upgradable to larger licenses
   with no price penalty, as described under Multi-System Licenses
   below).]

   See the LICENSE.TXT file or the printed material which came with your
   order for the complete text of our warranty and related disclaimers,
   which is separate from this satisfaction guarantee.


PRODUCT OVERVIEW
----------------
   JP Software's award-winning products are designed to make it easier
   to work with your computer by providing powerful, flexible, and easy
   to use command line tools.

   All six of our primary products are "command processors":  They
   display the command prompt (for example, "C:\>" or "[C:\]"), allow
   you to enter commands, and interpret and execute the commands you
   type.

   Your operating system comes with a command processor which performs
   the same basic function (it's called COMMAND.COM in DOS and Windows
   95, or CMD.EXE in OS/2 and Windows NT).  As you probably know if
   you've used the command prompt at all, these built-in command
   processors are very limited, out of date, and quite unfriendly.

   In contrast, our products are modern tools which make the command
   line easy and straightforward to use, rather than frustrating and
   inefficient.  They're compatible with the traditional command
   processors that come with your operating system, so the commands
   you're used to work just as you'd expect.  Then we've added hundreds
   of new features and capabilities that will make work at the command
   prompt simple, productive, and worthwhile.

   We've also created a comprehensive set of new batch file commands and
   functions that allow batch developers to perform in a few lines what
   used to take hundreds -- or couldn't be done at all.

   If you've never used our products, you're probably reading this
   because you downloaded a trial copy.  We encourage you to try this
   product (or any of the others we offer!) and see if you like it.  For
   a more detailed overview of features see Chapter 1 of the
   "Introduction and Installation Guide", in the file <PRODNAME>.TXT
   (i.e.  4DOS.TXT, 4NT.TXT, etc.), or our web site.  Feel free to
   contact us with questions that come up during your evaluation.  You
   can also purchase any product and try it out, risk-free, under our
   full 90-day money-back satisfaction guarantee (see the previous
   section).

   All six of our products offer very similar sets of features and
   commands.  Our goal is to make the same set of enhancements available
   in each operating environment, so you can move easily from one to
   another without having to limit your work, or switch tools.

   Our command processors are divided into two types:  "Text Mode" and
   "Graphical User Interface" (GUI) products.  A text mode command
   processor is the kind you're probably used to:  It displays commands
   and their output in a fixed font, typically with 80 columns in a line
   and 25 lines on the screen, and offers none of the "graphical"
   features like menus or toolbars that are common in GUI environments
   such as Windows or OS/2.  A GUI command processor works very much
   like a text mode product, but runs in a GUI environment and has the
   "look and feel" appropriate to that environment.  GUI command
   processors aren't as flexible as their text-mode counterparts in
   handling text-mode application programs, but they often "fit" better
   in the GUI environment.  (For a more comprehensive document on
   choosing the right product, see our web site.)

   The individual products are:

      * 4DOS, our award-winning 16-bit DOS product, replaces the
        traditional DOS command processor (COMMAND.COM) under Windows
        95/98, MS-DOS / PC-DOS 3.0 or above, Novell DOS / OpenDOS 3.4 or
        above, and in OS/2 DOS sessions.

      * 4NT, a 32-bit Windows NT text-mode command processor, replaces
        Windows NT's CMD.EXE under Windows NT 3.51, 4.0, and above.

      * 4OS2, our 32-bit OS/2 text-mode command processor, replaces the
        default OS/2 command processor (CMD.EXE) under OS/2 Warp 3.0,
        Warp 4.0, and above.

      * Take Command/32, our 32-bit Windows GUI command processor, runs
        under Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 3.51, 4.0, and above.

      * Take Command for OS/2 is a 32-bit OS/2 Presentation Manager GUI
        command processor.  It runs under OS/2 Warp 3.0 and 4.0.

      * Take Command/16. a 16-bit Windows 3.x GUI command processor,
        runs under Windows 3.1 and 3.11, and Windows for Workgroups.

   We also offer:
   
      - Product Packs and a CD which make it easy to combine products to
        suit your needs; see the next section (NEW COPIES) for details.

      - Multi-system licenses which allow you to run any product or set
        of products on multiple systems; see MULTI-SYSTEM LICENSES
        below.

      - Runtime products which let you run scripts or batch files across
        a group of systems without installing a complete updated command
        line; see RUNTIME PRODUCTS below.


NEW COPIES
----------
   We offer each product individually at $69.95 (includes an
   Introduction and Installation Guide; the Reference Manual can be
   purchased separately for $16.95).

   A quick description of each product is in the previous section; for
   more details see the documentation which came with the product you
   downloaded, or the complete descriptions available on our web site.

   Our CD and Product Packs give you a wide range of options for
   purchasing multiple products, depending on your operating system and
   your needs and preferences:
      
   >> The JP CD SUITE includes all six products for those using multiple
      operating systems, and costs only $119.95!
                                                                  
      In most cases, you'll find the CD Suite offers better value than
      any Product Pack when you are purchasing three or more of our
      products, and many users of just two products find it more
      convenient as well.  Also, when upgrade time comes, at current
      prices a CD upgrade costs the same as upgrading two individual
      products.  The CD Suite comes with complete on-line documentation
      and both Introduction and Installation Guides; if you need
      Reference Manuals the Reference Manual Pack is only $29.95.

   >> We also offer the following packs for those who need to use two
      complementary products on one system:
                                                                  
         * The Windows 95/98 Pack includes 4DOS and Take Command/32, for
           just $99.95.
   
         * The Windows NT Pack includes 4NT and Take Command/32 for
           $99.95.
   
         * The OS/2 Pack includes 4OS2 and 4DOS for only $99.95.
   
         * The Windows Pack includes 4DOS and Take Command/16, for
           $99.95.

   Finally, we offer a "Help Text Disk" for 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT.  This
   disk, which is available for $19.95, contains the files you need to
   customize our help text (for use on your own system or by others
   within your organization who have purchased our products).  The 4DOS
   help text includes a help compiler; the 4OS2 and 4NT help text
   require the compiler appropriate to your operating system (e.g., from
   the OS/2 or Windows NT Software Development Kit).  The 4DOS and 4OS2
   help text source files are ASCII; the 4NT source file is in Microsoft
   Word 97 format.


MULTI-SYSTEM LICENSES
---------------------
   Multi-System Licenses allow you to run our enhanced command line
   tools on multiple systems, at a substantial discount.  Larger
   licenses are discounted even more heavily, and multi-product licenses
   are available as well (details on both are below).

   (If you need to run batch files across a group of systems without
   installing an updated command line see the next section on RUNTIME
   PRODUCTS.)

   Some typical license configurations and prices are shown below.  For
   larger licenses or intermediate license sizes not shown, please
   request a specific quote on the license configuration that best meets
   your needs.

              500          6,500       8,150       9,750

   Multi-system licenses may be used at any number of physical sites,
   and on networked or stand-alone systems, as long as all support and
   distribution are handled through a single location.

   You can increase your license size at any time simply by paying the
   increase fee, which is the difference in price between the old and
   new licenses (if your old license is not for the current version you
   must upgrade it when you order the increase; see UPGRADES above for
   information).  When you place a license increase order be sure to
   provide your serial number, and the old and new number of systems
   licensed.  Contact us for a quote on license sizes not listed above.

   Multi-system licenses include the Introduction and Installation
   Guide(s) for the product(s) you license.  Additional Reference
   Manuals and/or manual sets are available for all products; contact us
   for pricing and item numbers.


RUNTIME PRODUCTS
----------------
   JP Software's Runtime products are advanced scripting tools designed to
   give IS managers, network administrators, and VARs the ability to run
   powerful batch scripts across a wide range of platforms in corporate and
   network environments.
   
   All four runtime products offer the full power of the corresponding
   complete command line tools described above.  The only functional
   difference between the runtime version and the complete version of
   each product is that the runtime version can only run batch files,
   and does not display the normal interactive command prompt (e.g.
   "C:\>").

   The runtime products are:
   
      4DOS Runtime:  Text-based scripting for Windows 95/98, DOS, and
      OS/2 DOS sessions.
   
      4NT Runtime:  Text-based scripting for Windows NT.
   
      4OS2 Runtime:  Text-based scripting for OS/2 Warp.
   
      Take Command/32 Runtime:  GUI-based scripting for Windows 95/98 and
      Windows NT.
   
   These tools are perfect when you don't want to learn a whole new
   language, but you need a lot more than what traditional batch files
   offer.

   Some typical runtime product configurations and prices are shown
   below.  For larger licenses or intermediate license sizes not shown,
   please request a specific quote on the license configuration that
   best meets your needs.

   You can increase your runtime license size at any time simply by
   paying the increase fee, which is the difference in price between the
   old and new licenses.
   
   Runtime licenses may be used at any number of physical sites within your
   organization.  They can also be used on networked or stand-alone
   systems, as long as all support and distribution are handled through a
   single location.
   
   Each runtime license includes a single-seat development license for the
   corresponding base product, allowing the developer full access to the
   enhanced script language along with debugging tools and the company's
   complete interactive command line toolset.  Licenses can be customized
   to include additional development seats at our standard multi-system
   license rates.
   
   We also offer two special kinds of licenses.  Please contact us for
   details on:
   
      - Use in "thin-client" environments under Microsoft's Windows
        NT Terminal Server or Citrix Winframe / Metaframe
        
      - OEM licensing for VARs and developers who wish to distribute
        products or script-based tools to multiple customers using 4DOS,
        4NT, 4OS2, or Take Command/32 runtime scripts.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------
   The printed documentation available for our products includes an
   Introduction and Installation Guide to help you get started using the
   software, and a Reference Manual with complete reference information.
   There are two versions of each -- one covers the character-mode
   products (4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT); the other covers all three versions
   of Take Command.

   Virtually all of the information in these manuals is also included in
   the online help for each product.  In addition, the Introduction and
   Installation Guide is included in ASCII form with all of our
   products.

   Here's the printed documentation we ship with each product:

      - New copies of 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT, Take Command, the product packs,
        and the JP CD Suite all come with the corresponding Introduction
        and Installation Guide(s).  The Reference Manual(s) must be
        purchased separately ($16.95 each, or both for $29.95).

      - Multi-system licenses come with an Introduction and Installation
        Guide for the product(s) licensed.  Reference Manuals and/or
        additional manual sets which include the Introduction and
        Instllation Guide and Reference Manual may be purchased (up to
        the number of systems licensed), contact us for pricing.

      - Upgrades and Add-Ons / Conversions come with the new
        Introduction and Installation Guide(s) you need for the
        product(s) you are upgrading.  New Reference Manuals must be
        purchased separately ($16.95 each).

   PLEASE NOTE:  If you order through our electronic delivery service
   you'll receive an ASCII copy of the Introduction and Installation
   Guide, and complete reference information in the online help.
   Printed documentation is NOT included with online orders, and must be
   purchased separately.

   the corresponding Introduction and Installation Guide; or $34.95 for
   a full set containing both Reference Manuals and both Introduction

UPGRADES
--------
   Individual product upgrades are $34.95 for the first product, and
   $19.95 for each additional product.  Please include your current
   serial number for each product you are upgrading.

   A JP CD Suite upgrade is $54.95 if you have the CD Suite Release 2
   with six products, or $64.95 if you have CD Suite Release 1 with 5
   products.  Maintenance releases of the CD Suite are $19.95.

   Switching operating systems?  Not sure which operating system you'll
   be using in the future?  Own three or more products already?  Convert
   from your current individual product(s) to the JP CD Suite (listed on
   the upgrade order form under Add-Ons / Conversions) and you'll
   receive all six JP Software command line tools, including upgrades
   for all the products you own now.  This option is just $89.95 if you
   own one product, and $69.95 if you own two or more -- if you are
   upgrading three or more products this means you can convert to the CD
   Suite for the same amount you'd pay for your upgrade, or less!

   Additional Upgrade Notes:

      Individual product upgrade and add-on prices listed here and on
      the upgrade order form are valid for those who own an up to date,
      registered copy of 4DOS 5.0 or above, 4OS2 or 4NT 2.0 or above, or
      any version of Take Command.  Upgrades from older versions (4DOS
      4.02 and below, 4OS2 / 4NT 1.x) are an additional $10 per product.

      If you have a multi-system license and it is listed in the table
      below, you can order an upgrade at that price -- just be sure to
      provide your serial number and the number of systems licensed with
      your order.  If your license size is not listed, contact us for a
      quote.  To increase your license size at the same time as you
      upgrade you must purchase the upgrade, and also pay the
      appropriate license increase fee; see MULTI-SYSTEM LICENSES above
      for increase fees.

ADD-ONS and CONVERSIONS
-----------------------
   We offer substantial discounts when you need to purchase an
   additional product for use on the same system as your current JP
   Software product(s), switch from one product to another, or upgrade
   to the JP CD Suite with all six products.

   To add a product to your current system, or switch from one product
   to another, list the new product(s) you need on the order form; the
   cost is only $29.95 each.

   To upgrade to the JP CD Suite with all six products you'll pay just
   $89.95 if you currently own one product, and $69.95 if you own two or
   more.  This price includes upgrades for all products you currently
   own.

   These reduced prices are NOT valid if you need another product for
   use on a different system (e.g., you have 4DOS on one system and want
   to keep using it, and also put 4NT on a different system).  In that
   case you'll need to use our standard new system prices -- see "New
   Copies and Product Packs" above for details.


ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS
-------------------

   These products are selected to complement JP Software's primary
   offerings with utilities, editors, and other tools.  We use most of
   these products ourselves, and wanted to make them available to you as
   well.  If you need more information see the manufacturers' web sites
   listed below (or check our web site for convenient links).

     * Partition Magic (PowerQuest, $69.95):  Too much space in one hard
       drive partition?  Too little in another?  This invaluable
       management tool lets you resize and move partitions, and even
       changes cluster size on the fly!  We've found it easy to use,
       fast, reliable.  Runs under DOS, OS/2, Windows 95/98, and Windows
       NT; supports a wide range of partition types including FAT,
       FAT32, HPFS, NTFS, and more.  (Web site at
       http://www.powerquest.com/)

     * System Commander Deluxe (V Communications, $69.95):  This is an
       elegant solution for the multiple operating system user who's
       tired of "dual boot", and operating systems at war with each
       other.  System Commander boots more than 30 operating systems,
       including all recent and most older versions of MS-DOS, PC-DOS,
       DR-DOS / Novell DOS, OS/2, Windows 95/98, Windows NT, Netware,
       Linux, and many more.  It supports up to 99 boot menu choices,
       and handles unusual problems -- like booting multiple OS's from
       the C drive, or making the proper primary partition visible to
       each OS -- with ease.  (Web site at http://www.v-com.com/)

     * Boxer / TKO (Boxer Software, $79.95):  This award-winning text
       editor is a fast, easy-to-use, full-featured editor you can use
       for batch files, simple documents, and program code.  It offers
       hundreds of advanced features ranging from cross-file search and
       replace to color syntax highlighting for multiple file types
       (including for JP Software batch files!), and is fully
       reconfigurable to suit your tastes.  A "light" version of Boxer,
       Boxer/EZ, will be shipped with each purchased copy of 4DOS 6.02.
       This enhanced "TKO" version supports much larger files than
       Boxer/EZ, and includes dozens of additional features.  (Web site
       at http://www.boxersoftware.com/users/dhamel/)

     * REXX is a powerful, flexible, easy to use scripting language
       developed by IBM.  It's a perfect complement to the 4DOS, 4OS2,
       4NT, and Take Command batch language, and excellent for
       performing string manipulation and other more complex functions
       in batch files.  REXX is more powerful than traditional batch
       languages, but without the heavy technical baggage of
       conventional programming tools.  It was specifically designed to
       be easy to read and write, so you can get started quickly and get
       your work done efficiently.  If you need advanced string
       processing capabilities, or are stretching the limits of our
       batch language, then REXX is for you!

       We offer two REXX products:

        - WinREXX (Enterprise Alternatives, $79.95) is a complete,
          GUI-based REXX implementation for Windows 3.x, 95/98, and NT,
          and is directly supported from within 4NT and Take Command.
          Develop your WinREXX scripts using the built-in IDE, then run
          them seamlessly from your Take Command or 4NT command line, or
          invoke them from batch files.  (Web site at
          http://www.winrexx.com/)

        - Personal REXX (Quercus, DOS $149.95; DOS and OS/2 $169.95; DOS
          and Windows 3.x/95/98/NT $169.95) is a complete DOS and OS/2
          character-mode version of REXX, and can be used easily from
          within 4DOS or 4OS2.  The OS/2 version goes beyond what's
          available in IBM's OS/2 REXX.  (Web site at
          http://www.quercus-sys.com/)
