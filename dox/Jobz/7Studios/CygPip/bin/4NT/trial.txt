Greetings, and thanks for trying 4NT!

This file explains how trial versions of 4NT work, and
how you can give a purchased copy of 4NT to a friend to
use as a trial version.

For instructions on using a downloaded trial version to upgrade your
previous purchased copy to a new maintenance release see README.TXT.


Trial Version Basics
--------------------

   We distribute trial or "shareware" versions of our software to allow
   you to "try before you buy".  Most users obtain trial versions by
   downloading them.  You might also have one if a friend gave you a copy
   of their software -- as long as they don't give you their serial number
   and registration key (which would be illegal), the software they gave
   you will operate as a trial version.
   
   Trial versions are covered under the trial version license in the
   LICENSE.TXT file, which you should read before using your software.
   
   We explain here how trial versions work because we believe that full
   disclosure of what you can expect from your software is the best policy
   for both you and us.  Our timing mechanism is designed to give you a
   fair opportunity to try our software, order it, and receive it without
   significant restrictions on use.  It's also designed to make sure that
   use of the software becomes restricted if you significantly exceed the
   normal evaluation period.
   
   Trial versions of our products are fully functional evaluation copies
   which are not "crippled" or feature-limited in any way except for the
   trial timing mechanism described here.


Trial Version Timing
--------------------

   When you first install a trial version on your computer, it begins to
   count the number of days on which you use it.  Only actual days of use
   are counted -- if you go away for a few days, or are busy with other
   things and don't work with the product for a bit, the intervening days
   are not counted.
   
   You are given a 21-day evaluation period (remember that's 21 days of
   actual use -- three weeks if you use the product every day, or a little
   more than four 5-day work weeks of uninterrupted use).  The number of
   days remaining in the evaluation period is displayed when you start
   the program, and can be redisplayed at any time with the VER /R
   command.  At startup the software pauses briefly to allow you to read
   the information; this pause can be interrupted with a keystroke if
   you wish.  During the last 7 days of the evaluation period a short
   two-tone beep draws your attention to the signon message.
   
   Once you have reached 21 days of use the evaluation period expires and
   you are given a grace period of 14 additional days (of actual use) to
   make sure you have time to receive your order of a purchased copy.
   During this period you are advised at signon that usage will be
   restricted once the grace period expires, and of the number of days
   remaining (use VER /R to redisplay the number of days remaining).
   Also, the startup delay for reading the signon message becomes slightly
   longer, the first part of the delay is no longer interruptible with a
   keystroke (to continue, just wait a couple of seconds, then press a
   key), and a sequence of beeps is used to draw your attention to the
   reminder messages.

   After expiration of the grace period your use of the software is
   restricted by limiting the number of commands you can enter before
   the program exits automatically and must be restarted.  You are advised
   of the usage restriction each time you start the program.  There is
   also a significant delay each time the program starts, and a
   substantial portion of that delay is not interruptible with a
   keystroke.

   Once use is restricted the software will also sound a noticeably longer
   sequence of beeps each time it is started.

   If you have ordered a copy of our software directly from us, at or
   before the end of the evaluation period, and find that the grace period
   expires and use becomes restricted before your order arrives, please
   contact us for assistance.


Installing the Purchased Version After a Trial
----------------------------------------------

   When you install a purchased copy of 4NT, you may
   choose to:
   
      - Install it in a new directory, and then delete the trial version
        directory;
        
      - Install the purchased version "over" (in the same directory as)
        the trial version;
        
      - Install only the "branding" program from the purchased version
        (when this option is offered by the installation software), and
        use it to "brand" the trial version with your name and serial
        number, converting it to a purchased copy.
   
   In each case, once you install the purchased copy and "brand" it with
   your name and serial number, all trial messages and delays should
   stop.  (If 4NT was running during installation of the
   purchased version you must exit and restart for the newly installed
   name and serial number to take full effect).


Giving Copies to Others to Try
------------------------------

   We know many of our customers may want to give a copy of one of our
   products to a friend or colleague to try.
   
   We encourage you to share your purchased copy of our software with
   individuals you know personally.  The only restriction is that you
   must use the simple approach described here to avoid violating your
   license agreement or disclosing the registration key (for which you
   paid!) to others.
   
   To give a copy of your software to someone else for evaluation
   purposes, simply let them borrow or make a copy of your diskette, CD
   (or the desired subirectory from the CD), or downloaded electronic
   purchase.  When your friend or colleague installs the software you've
   passed along to them in this way, without your serial number and
   validation key, the program will automatically become a trial version
   using the system described earlier in this file.  The recipient may
   then decide whether to purchase the software under our normal trial
   version policies.
   
   Please note that under our license and trial version policies there
   are also some things you may NOT do:
   
      - You may not give the other person your serial number or branding
        codes, as these are private and represent the license you paid
        for (giving them to others is a violation of your license
        agreement).
   
      - You may not give the other person copies of installed files from
        your hard disk, as these may have the serial number and code
        embedded in them.
   
      - You may not place copies of your purchased copy of our software
        on any Internet or other electronic distribution site, or in any
        user group or other shareware library, or distribute them to the
        public at large in any way.  This policy only allows you to
        distribute copies to friends and colleagues you know personally
        and privately.
   
   You should also read LICENSE.TXT, and remind the recipient to read
   that license and this file for complete licensing and trial version
   information.
   
   PLEASE NOTE:  This policy allows for only one level of distribution;
   those who receive copies of your purchased software for trial use
   under this policy may NOT further redistribute those copies to their
   friends and colleagues.

   If you need a true trial copy for general distribution, download one
   from our web site at http://www.jpsoft.com/.
