;
; Customizes a few Windows NT functions to best take advantage of
; features provided by JP Software's 4NT command processor:
;
; 1.  Creates a new "4NT Prompt here" entry in the context menu of drives
;     and directories.  Selecting that option will launch 4NT in that
;     drive or directory.
;
; 2.  Provides an additional "open" option in the context menu of all
;     batch files (.BAT, .CMD, and .BTM), to run the file with 4NT.
;
; 3.  Extends Windows' definition of a "batch file" to include *.BTM
;     files.   If you want the ability to double-click on a *.BTM to
;     execute it, you have several options, including:
;
;     a. Make "Open with 4NT" the default action for file type
;     "batfile".
;
;     b. Change the default action (typically set to "%1") to invoke 4NT.
;
;     For either option, if you prefer not to deal directly with the
;     Registry Editor (REGEDIT), it's best if your system is configured
;     so that you can edit the Properties of file type "batfile" by
;     opening an Explorer Window ("My Computer", for example) and selecting
;     "View", "Options", then "File Types".  If you don't see an entry for
;     "MS-DOS Batch Files" or the edit options are unavailable, and you
;     prefer not dealing with the Registry directly, see file
;     "jpbatch.reg" on our Web site (in the "Directory of ASCII Files").
;
; 4.  Includes itself among the features that can be "uninstalled" via the
;     Windows Control Panel.

; 4NT.EXE, right-click on the file name from a Windows Explorer window,
; and select the "Install" option on the popup menu.
