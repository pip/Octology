SOURCE CODE ORGANIZATION:
-------------------------
The source code is organized as follows:

       uw      vf   [source for OSENVIRONMENT specific functions]


Each of the directories (eg. bsd43, mscdos, tccdos, and sysvr3) contain source
that is specific to that release of the OS (and possibly C-library)


CREATING A NEW VERSION:
-----------------------
To create yet another version of dmake you should follow the following steps.

The sysvr3 version as sent is the base version, all dmake versions must provide
the equivalent of the functions defined in the sysvr3 directory, and MUST
provide the same semantics (MSDOS archive lib searches are an exception since
we cannot search libraries for timestamps in MSDOS, Actually the MKS version
of dmake does this, I don't have the inclination to add this code though).

1. Create a new directory for the version you will be making at the level
   that is appropriate.  If it is a new OS then add the dir at the top level,
   if it is a new version of UNIX then add it below the unix directory.

2. Copy the files from the unix and unix/sysvr3 directories to the new dir.
   (Or from any other directory sub-tree that is more appropriate)

3. Not all OS/OSRELEASE combinations are compatible so in order to make
   dmake on each, the particular directory may contain C-source for functions
   present in the SVID SysV R3 distribution which are used by dmake but are
   not supplied by the C-library in the target system.  For example the bsd43
   directory contains source for tempnam.c since it is not provided with
   the BSD C-library.  Before writing a new version of the source file
   check the other directories to see if one already exists.

4. Under some systems the standard include files may be missing or incorrect.
   eg. under BSD stdarg.h and string.h.  If this is the case
   you should create the proper .h file in the proper directory.
   This works as expected as the compile line includes the flag -Idir
   where dir is the configuration dir, (bsd43 for example) and any
   standard include files will be searched for in dir before the compiler
   looks in the normal places (if you have a sane compiler :-).

5. Modify dmake.sh to contain the appropriate C compiler flags and link command
   and to include any specific C files that you have had to add for this
   version of dmake, and run the result through the shell.
   (make the same changes to config.mk so that once you have a working copy of
   dmake you can use it to bring itself up to date)

6. Send me the changes :-) so that I can incorporate them into future
   distributions.

7. This should be all that you require to create a new version of dmake.
