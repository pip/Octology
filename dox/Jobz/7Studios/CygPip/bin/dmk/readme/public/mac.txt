MAC specific information for dmake.  This information is provided in the
hope that it makes it easier to install and recompile dmake in a MAC
environment.  


1. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SETTINGS

Only a single set of settings is available for the macintosh.  There are no
sub-selections for specific OS release and/or environment.

   OS		 - mac
   OSRELEASE	 - NULL
   OSENVIRONMENT - NULL


2. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

This port for the Macintosh is specifically designed to be run
under MPW.

I had to make a couple of changes to dmake in order to get it to work
on the Mac.  First, MPW provides no documented way to run a
subprocess, so when you use dmake, you MUST use the -n option and
execute the output.  Typically, you will probably want to write a
simple script file to do these operations for you.

I added some code so that the Macintosh version of dmake can
use UNIX-style directories to specify include paths and target
and dependency file names.  I.e., if you specify a file "/dir/file",
dmake will look at the file "dir:file".  However, Mac dmake does not
do any translation from files specified by UNIX-style directories
in the recipe line that gets executed.  If you need to translate,
you can use substitution commands.  (For example,
":$(RELATIVEUNIXFILE:s,/,:,)".)  This code was added so one could
execute dmake's makefile, and also so one would have an easier time
porting other UNIX makefiles.  I would suggest you stick with
Macintosh-style directories for all other makefiles.

In order to run dmake, you must set (and export) the environmental
variable "OS" to "mac".
