OS/2 specific information for dmake.  This information is provided in the
hope that it makes it easier to install and recompile dmake in a OS/2
environment.

Notes on the OS/2 implementation of dmake:
==========================================

As shipped the DOS versions of dmake will run under OS/2 protected mode.
However, support for a full OS/2 version is also provided.  The OS/2 version
will run in parallel under OS/2.

Bootstrapping the binary:
-------------------------
   A make.cmd file is provided to bootstrap the binary.  The file contains
   several targets for bootstrapping.  Invoking the batch file with no
   arguments lists the possibilities shown below.

      INDEX:  You must specify one of:
	 ibm	  - IBM C2 compile.

   The only supported compiler under OS/2 is the Visual Age ICC compiler.
   I have tested the build using this compiler.  The resulting binary
   performs proper directory caching and file-name case mapping for cached
   directories and is capable of parallel target builds.  The only known
   limitation of the OS/2 implementation is the treatment of library time
   stamps.  Libraries do not have time stamps on members and the timestamp
   of the library is used instead.


OS/2 Specifics
--------------

   There is a small number of OS/2 specific features that need to be
   stated.  

   1. The environment variables TMP as well as TMPDIR are checked for the
      location of the directory where dmake should place any temporary files.
      TMPDIR is checked before TMP.

   2. Appropriate limits are setup for MAXPROCESSES and buffer sizes etc.
      See output of 'dmake -V'.

   3. By default dmake will look for the startup.mk file in the path:
          
	  $(ROOTDIR)/dmake/startup/startup.mk

      This is more in keeping with OS/2 philosophy.  You may still rename
      and put it anywhere else you like by defining the MAKESTARTUP
      environment variable.

   4. Swapping the dmake binary to disk is not supported under OS/2.


Other notes:
------------
   dmake does not care if you are running cmd.exe or some other command
   interpretter, you must however specify the proper values of the environment
   variables SHELL, SHELLFLAGS, GROUPSHELL, and GROUPFLAGS in order for things
   to work correctly.  Read the man page first.

   Group recipes under OS/2 that use cmd.exe as the command interpretter
   require you to set the GROUPSUFFIX macro.

   As shipped the startup.mk files try to figure out what
   command interpretter you are using and set things up appropriately.
   Two command interpretters are supported in the shipped startup.mk file,
   cmd.exe (via COMSPEC), and the MKS Korn shell.

   dmake does not contain any builtin commands.  It gets all commands it
   executes from an external file system.  It is therefore most useful if it
   is used in conjunction with an environment similar to that provided by
   the MKS Tool kit, or equivalent.

   dmake now supports the MKS argument passing conventions.  The facility is
   enabled by setting .MKSARGS:=1 and is set by default in the startup.mk file
   if an MKS Korn shell is detected as being the active command interpretter.
