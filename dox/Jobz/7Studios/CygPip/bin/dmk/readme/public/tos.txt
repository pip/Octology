Atari TOS specific information for dmake.  This information is provided in the
hope that it makes it easier to install and recompile dmake in a TOS
environment.  I do not own an ST.  As a result I rely on others to insure that
this version of dmake works as advertized.  If you have any problems with it
please fix them and send me the differences so that I can incorporate them
into future releases and patches.


1. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SETTINGS

Only a single set of settings is available for Atari TOS.  There are no
sub-selections for specific OS release and/or environment.

   OS		 - tos
   OSRELEASE	 - NULL
   OSENVIRONMENT - NULL


2. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

The code to compile on an Atari-ST using GCC was supplied by Edgar Roeder
(roeder@cs.uni-sb.de).  I do not have an ST on which to verify the
distribution sources but I have no reason to believe them to not work.
If there are any problems please let Edgar or myself know.

I know of no bugs or limitation to the Atari-ST implementation.  Note that
it is similar to the DOS version but it does not swap itself out.  This does
not appear to be as much of a problem on the Atari as it is on MSDOS boxes :-).
See the msdos specific info file for further information.
