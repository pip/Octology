Hello. I am a retired video game developer from California who moved here to Wisconsin to be near family. I am definitely a hardcore computer nerd.

I'm 5'8" and about 160 pounds right now. My belly is chubby, but otherwise I remain rather slim. I have no tattoos or piercings but don't mind them.

I am single and have never been married. I have no children, but might like to sire a couple kiddos with the right woman someday. Kids are precious.

I totally adore my beloved and most darling cat. I generally enjoy the company of well-behaved dogs almost as much as felines. I like playing tennis.

I am on Disability for Bipolar disorder and don't have a job at the moment, so I have a great deal of free time most days. Very flexible schedule.

Coffee is my morning friend. I am a casual cigar smoker and enjoy 420. I rarely get drunk but thoroughly enjoy savoring fine craft beers on occasion.

I'm looking for a gentle woman to hang out with and get to know. I like to go for walks and watch movies. I love most music (and especially Dubstep).

Money is pretty scarce so I usually can't afford to go out. Neither do I have a car right now, so I rely mainly on buses, my bike, and my skateboards.

I basically want to establish a new solid friendship as the foundation for a potentially intimate and loving romantic relationship in the future.

Thank you for reading my post. If you're interested, please feel free to respond with as little or as much about yourself as you care to. Peace. =)
