Why am I qualified to manage asset-management?

I'm not qualified to manage asset-management.  Well I wasn't before I
realized that.  I'm no more qualified than anyone else.  That's part of
the point.  Smooch.  FLCL.  It's like the representation &&
categorization of stuff.  Data.  It gets stored.  It's tagged as
valuable.  People want to store it.  People search for it.  That is
data that has value.  It is desired.  Craved.  Passionate wanting...
longing.  That's the thing.  It's describing... ascribing value.  It is
the same power we all have.  Every person... no robot.  Robots ...
software ... it runs.  It does.  It doesn't forget.  It doesn't act in
spite of itself or others.  Do you understand?

I don't know how to better value assets.  I don't have higher priority.
It's like antiquated.  The notion of class structures.  The notion of
human inequality.  These ideas are fading.  People are not great because
of where they've come from... what race they are... or how beautiful they
are/were.  Those pass.  Like kaka.  The lasting thing is the mark we make.
It is the immature adult.  It is the play.  The ongoing oingo boingo game.
It is recollection.  It is nuance.  It is humor.  It is the battle of man
vs. machine.  Neither is real && both are.  It is a legacy.  It is pain.
Emotion.  The drive to cry && burn.

Hanging out.  Why store?  Why decide?  Why swing the bat?

Cats && Dogs.  It is storing what we decide is valuable.  It is the
desire... the will to steam.

So watch FLCL && be a drama queen.  Look into the eyes of a cat && think
yourself a dog.

Each of us can only be ourself.  We can want to be different but we can
only ever be ourself.  The only real wannabe you can ever be is yourself.
It's a self-referential (recursive) definition.  You want to be someone
else... you want to be a suburbanite thug... you want to be bad or good...
you want to be pure... you want to be true... you want to be saved... you
want to be lost... you want to be drunk... you want to be fast... you want
to be alive... you want to fly && cry && dream in color.  All those things...
are what we are together.  We push && pull.

We feel && kill.  We FLCL.  We live && die.  We each manage assets.  We each
decide what to preserve && what to destroy.  We each make a valuation every
time we make a valuation.  Vacuation.  Paradoxes.  They cancel each other
out.  The only paradox is that there are an infinite number.

So I justify that I'm no greater than anyone.  We all do what we do.  I want
us to be equal yet free to categorize... valuate whatever we want... make it
easy.

Class structures... hierarchies of people are not beautiful.  I want to be
on the bottom just like I think everyone else should once they realize that
any superiority is just negligible difference... or interesting difference
but not warranting authority.  Don't succumb to authority.  Don't accede...
relinquish.  Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji... these are beautiful.  The strokes
of beautiful characters.  These are valuable.  They are to be stored.  Same
with Hebrew.  The Torah must be preserved as-is.  Knowledge... Wisdom.  They
are all valued.  They must be easy to store freely.  Permanently.  Easy to
encode && decode.  Easy to replicate.  To desire storage of.  To see the
proliferation of.  Tools.  The recognization of this need.  I want to help.

I want to serve.  But not like a machine.  I'm not like software that serves
blindly.  That serves diligently.  I may be diligent if I so choose.

Therein lies the rub.  The key.  The bat.  The chopsticks.  The guitar.
The bike.  The dong.  Blunt.

The recalcitrant... the unmanageable means the alive.  When you conform...
when you fall into line... you are a behaver.  You are trapped && free.  You
dream of your freedom within the machine that encapsulates.  That conforms
all in its image.  It reflects && rejects.

So you do your best.  I do too.  Sometimes it's what it is.  Other times,
it's not what it's not.  Do you see?  The brain wrinkles.  Thoughts.

We convey them && encode them.  We convey them && encode them.

How will we store assets?  How will we encode them?  I don't know but what
I do know is that ideas are not meant to be proprietary.  When someone
shares a dream... it's supposed to persist as long as it's a valuable
dream.  Even without color, they are nostalgic && formative && powerful.

So wake from slumber && slumber some more.  I want to help categorize data
in ways that we, collectively, value.  Maybe it's language... maybe it's
execution... maybe it's cooperative or competitive.  They each have a
crucial place.  They each permeate ourselves && our world.

So share && let things come out of your head.  Let them wreak havok upon
the world.  Let them become complacent among the world.  Let them be what
they are && let them be what you are.  Let it be.

I'm qualified because I know I'm no better than anyone else.  I'm qualified
to help us all store whatever we want because... I know that that's what
matters.  After you read this... or if you knew before (which hopefully you
did)... then you can easily join me.  You can create free anime.  Manga is
cool... you know?

Here's the thing:  "free" is valuable.  Ideas are not scarce.  By nature...
they are (as they should be) contagious && freely expansive... freely
propagated.  Culture.  The domains.  The scopes.  The areas.  The spaces.

There are reasons.  Think about it.

Add what you want.  Take what you want (without diminishing what's there).
Leave what you want (which does dimish in an opposite sense but one that you
have decided upon).

So do I do a good job?  I work with the tools I'm given to make better tools.
I want to help others think && categorize but my way is only mine... so my
tools are of limited use to others.  I'm hoping that at some point... I will
construct a sufficient amount... a critical mass... surpass an event horizon...
where people will be able to do the same thing easily.  To be able to create
&& extend.  To share the free && deal responsibly with the scarce... the really
scarce... not the artificially scarce.

If such is my goal... what I think about... who I am... then am I qualified to
decide?  Still, no.  I am no more qualified than anyone else.  I strive to
construct English sentences && speech with excellent spelling, grammar, &&
expressiveness... the same as my body... the same as my video game playing...
the same as my programming... the same as my motorcycle riding... the same as
the expression of my life.  It is the value I place on myself && everything
around me.  This is what we each do.  This is all && nothing.  You may notice
that in my English excellence... I have adopted my own mannerisms like '&&'
which is a 'logical AND' in software.  It is not a short-circuit.  If the
first evaluates to TRUE, the second must still be evaluated.  It is NOT OR.
X OR Y short-circuits if X is TRUE.  && is the opposite.  You must negate
the truth of both.  '&&' is the same in code && speech (as far as I can tell).
It is a useful logical construct.  It is easy to recognize as a logical unit
of value && computation.  I decide to draw it into language.  When I speak, I
want it to be '&&'.  I want it to be a logical union of the truth of both
clauses.  Conversely, 'or' in speech is ambiguous.  According to context, it
is 'logical OR' (the negation of AND) or 'exclusive OR (XOR)'.  Did you see
which one that was?  That is why my writing && speech are not '||' or '^|'.
Maybe they should be to clarify but context already does that.  Deeper parsing.
It is necessary.  Scope.  Context.  We must draw the lines together.  With
chalk we make hop-scotch.  With paint, we make lanes.  With laws, we make
sheep.  Make voluntary lines.  Let people follow or lead according to their
capacity && desire.

I love Samurai Champloo but I can't neglect FLCL.

Even though I'm not qualified, I hope you'll choose me or permit me anyway.

I only want us to be able to easily construct && store && categorize...
together.  Free Software works towards these ends.  Let hardware be scarce
as necessary.  Let ideas && data && thoughts && culture && dreams be shared &&
indexed ... if we see fit to do so.  Store climax && nadir.  Store diction &&
fiction.  Store every language && species.  Store what we want.  Care about
what you want.  Be.

It can change or it can be the same.  It can be wonderful or horrid.  It can
destroy the minds && cultivate others.  It can submerge && surface.  I must be
king of myself... && only anyone else who wishes.

So joke && play.  Drink && think.  Figure && Tigger.  Love && rub.  Simple as
a pimple.  Soft as a loft.  Snug as a hug.

I'll do a bad job.  I'm just human.  I think I can.  I do what I do.
