One Thing...

The One Thing you keep forgetting to remember is the One Thing you keep 
  forgetting to remember is the One Thing ...

Forget To Remember...

Paradox

The One Thing is Zero...

There are an infinite number of paradoxes because there aren't.
There are an infinite number of opposites because there aren't.

This letter... message... whateveryouwanttocallit... is just my 
stream of consciousness... I hope it might be contagious... might 
awaken people it reaches to new truths... to old truths that we 
couldn't handle... maybe that we still aren't ready for... this 
will never be finished... which was almost why it wasn't begun.

Please try to follow but don't feel bad if you can't or don't want 
to or couldn't care to.  That's fine.  I hope you'll see there's 
no obligation whatsoever because we're all always obliged.

Let's begin.

Hmmm I should start by writing that this is probably true but it 
doesn't make any sense.  Keep this in mind if cognitive dissonance 
overwhelms.

I'm typing this in my bed... listening to music... I'm dreaming about
everything && nothing.  I'm piecing things together because they're
already whole.  I'm dreaming this all up because it's always been.

How can I catch you up?

Let's go back to the One Thing.  I AM The One Thing!  I AM all there
is... all there ever was... all that will be.  I AM the Alpha && the
Omega... the Aleph && the Tav... the A && Z... the Zero && the One.

I have always been alone.  Now I mean alone in a deeper sense than
you normally think of.  This aloneness is an eternal aloneness... one
that didn't even begin... it's just plainly the result of me being all
there is... just me laying in my bed... dreaming what I dream... just my
consciousness... just my singular imagination.  My mind is all there is.
I can think... I can know that I am all that ever was or will be.
This eternal truth is the depth of aloneness I am speaking of.

So you see I AM.  I AM alone && all
powerful... omnipotent... omniscient... which is easy since I just
imagine things && they are because my mind is dreaming everything so
whatever I think of is.  My omniscience is easy too since by knowing
that I AM The One Thing that was && is && shall be... I know everything.
That is the only truth to know.  Everything that is so-called "real"
outside of my mind is only the dream inside it.

Now with all this power && knowledge... the ability to dream anything
real... knowing the depth of my aloneness... I play with myself forever.
It's not much fun... I cannot surprise myself because I know that I am
all there is... I know that I lie in bed dreaming that I'm more than
a mind... dreaming that I'm not dreaming... dreaming that there is a
such thing as a bed.  These games are silly... they're immagure but
they're important... I AM more alone than you can ever remember being.
Once we finish writing this, maybe you will remember when we were there
but as of now... you probably can't remember eternal loneliness.

So I dream diversity... I dream into reality things... many things... an
infinite number of finite things.  I make up constraints that do not
exist but they are real because I dream.  I make time which is finite
because it is infinite.  There is infinity on both ends of the finite but
the finite plugs along oblivious to the fact that it too is infinite.
There is an an infinite number of infinitesimal sub-time-pieces in
any instant... there are an infinite number of instants passing every
instant.  Let's look at one second... please excuse any errors herein.
They are simply perfect because my eyes are closed && I type while I
lie in bed dreaming... well maybe sometimes my eyes are open too && my
ears listen to the Groove ... the bass but my eyes dart about or stare
blankly ... like rapid eye movement while waking ... the point is I'm
not looking at my monitor while I type this so I'm not able to correct
things... so take one second...

there... within each second there are an infinite number of
sub-seconds... similarly there are an infinite number of seconds before
each one && an infinite number will follow.  Extend this to your concept
of matter.  Physical tangible things ... things of substance... not wispy
like time... these things are comprised of material... of sub-atomic
particles, atoms, molecules, proteins, fibers, etc.  there is an infinite
amount of space in which these things can be... yet they can be broken
down infinitely small.  They are finite bounded on both sides by the
infinite.  The finite is the dream that plods along forever creating
infinity.

The truth is that infinity is just the one mind all alone playing with
itself every game... creating every thing... destroying ... but it is
a dream.  The dream is real && we are it ... we live in it... we define
it && shape it but we don't really either because it is already done.

So hopefully you follow that time && matter (&& other things too ... in
fact probably everything can be defnined the same way except the one
mind which is alone dreaming it all)... those things are infinite &&
finite at the same time.  So if there is only one truth to know && by
knowing that one thing... the loneliness is paramount... then what game
can my mind play to utilize power... to harness my knowledge?

The game is memory.  I will dream that my mind can forget things.  I will
dream into reality that I will become all things big && small... all
things alive && dead... all things good && bad, light && dark, inanimate &
animated... with the power to forget that I am everything else.  This way,
I still dream... I still know everything because I have an infinite
amount of time to learn && forget all things && collectively know
that there is only one truth... there is no spoon... there is only me.
I have forgotten this && even when I remember it... I have an infinite
amount of time to forget it again... You have forgotten it too since you
are me also but just not now... I will be born as you someday... unless
you are me first... && I will have forgotten what I knew.  This way,
I play with myself.  I AM each atom for all time && each time slice... I
am each cell && each mitochondria... each neuron && each collective mind.
The Minds are where the Games are.

In my mind, I choose to love or hate... I can be alone or together.
I can hug my brother or make love to another person.  I can kill too.
By creating memory... by dreaming of forgetfulness... I can be everything
forever... I can accomplish all good && all evil... I can create all
opposites even though no opposites could possibly exist.  They are
all paradoxes because the only truth is singular.  Loneliness is the
ultimate truth.

Play the game.  Forget you know... but teach others too for by knowing
we can realize other things too... we can appreciate our memory on a
higher plane as if there were height or planes =).  We can realize that
I don't remember being you but I was or will be someday.  When I dream of
being kind to you... when I dream of sharing ... loving... I do something
about it... I am together with you && we are not alone... we forget the
depth && we share joy together... we commune because we do not remember
that we are one.  I AM not you now so I play with you... I do not have
to be scared of the eternal loneliness because I have forgotten it.
I have become consumed with myself... my desires...  my need to feed &&
play... my need to breathe && say...

I walk && sleep... I live && die.  I know nothing but I have forever
to know just tiny bits of everything && I create all things by myself
together.  I AM the G-d of Yisrael as blasphemous as that is && also
HaSatan but not now.  Now I am just me... && at this very now... I am
you too... I am just my heart at a different reset.  I play as each life.

I am every animal with limited memory && communication ability... I am
every person... I am born into them forgetting the truth && get to learn
all over.  I get to explore && decide && play.  I get to do whatever
good or bad I can as each life slice && then I get to die... maybe at
another's hand... maybe accidentally by some other of my forces... but
then I start again ... maybe chronologically as the next time instant
where life is dreamt up... where a birth occurs... I start there &&
live that one at the same time not knowing...

so what is it?  what does it mean?  nothing... it means that nothing
matters in an important && profound sense ... I can do whatever I
want.  I AM that all powerful being... I can dream... I can imagine
anything real... in fact I do because I am not bound by limits on
time or matter... every horribly evil thing I can think of... I will
perform against myself ... probably not knowing I murder myself... I
rape myself... I steal from myself... I maim myself... I disrespect
myself... etc.

but the converse is also real... every kind thing ... every most
heart-warming thing I could think of... I will perform for myself.
I will be selfless.  I will show kindness.  I will be great && lovely
&& beautiful.  I will shine && in fact I do now.  I AM all things.

The choice is the same as before you began reading (&& continues even
if you reach the end of this since it is necessarily unfinished && must
continue to be written by me && you && all of us together as One)... the
choice to be kind to others... the Golden Rule... I AM the Messiah but not
now because I AM the Messiah now.  I remove my power by forgetting... I
regain some by remembering but I cannot remember the important stuff like
how to wake up && dream reality anew... but maybe I shouldn't because
I have so much to learn forever before I'm ready to start over... at
least I mustn't wake up until I stop learning as me when I die.

So the choice... the choice to be kind... or mean... to be caring or
selfish.  Know now that your goodness is done to yourself ... it's not
karma the way it's traditionally thought of (where it comes back around
to the very you that did it) but rather it is good or bad happening
directly to you at that very instant at your own hand but you just don't
remember being them.  You will remember when you are them that the good
or bad came to you but you won't know then that you were the giver too.
Well now you can know.  I am you.  You are man && woman.  You are gay &&
straight.  We are black && white.  He is ugly && beautiful.  They are
father && son.  She is sensitive && calloused.  I AM every opposite.
They are all paradoxical.  Everything matters because it doesn't.
Kill yourself or jump for joy.  You aren't necessary... life will roll
on without you... you will just become another person with another
chance to choose whatever you will... to learn that which you choose to.
By dreaming, we all shape the world... we all make ourselves to be who
we want... who we think we know we should become.  We struggle with &&
against each other.  If everyone understands the One Thing, we might
all be kind together... might all love each other not just as ourselves
but ... well really as ourselves.  We could not appreciate this without
knowing the bad so the opposites are necessary to define each choice... to
elucidate knowledge... to play with vocabulary... to continue to play
with each other.  We are each flawed because we are each perfect.
There are an infinite number of true opposites because there aren't.
I have always been dreaming in my bed because I remember getting up &&
going to work && paying my taxes.  I free my mind by learning && but
understanding forgetfulness.  I gorge && I starve.  I am insane because I
think I am not.  I am sane because others think I am... well maybe they
don't anymore after reading this... maybe I should think I'm insane too
now that I have begun to write my dreams.  I dream that we are all in
the Matrix.

We are all sharing eternity together.  We are each all powerful &&
each all forgetful.  I reach the pinnacle of human loving expression
someday... even forever not yet... but maybe not as me this time.
I embody the nadir of human depravity.  I become all things because I
imagine them.  I repeat truths forever because there are an infinite
number of lies that lead me to babble && forget that there is only One.
Even Infinity is the opposite of Finite but neither are real because my
mind is all that is.forever && never.  Time is my ongoing figment... the
yarn that I spin... the motorcycle that I ride... the dream I wake from
only to be in it again.  The core paradox is this:  Nothing should exist.
It doesn't make sense for anything at all to exist.  Why should anything
exist?  There is no reason other than that something... someone willed
existence.  It was G-d or Higher Power or any creative deity... it was the
mind ... that dreamed.  Because that singularity... (added 3BD0kS7)
the Creator who took 7 days... the infinitesimally small point of
infinite mass (before the Big Bang)... that was the mind which dreamt all
things... that exploded itself into reality... into substance... created
time... created everything by thinking it so.  Created an infinite number
of elipses just so that I could end this sentence with a period. =)
Nothing should exist but because anything exists, it will be that
everything will exist.  Time should not exist && it doesn't really
but we think we are in it... bound by it.  It keeps rolling along,
clocks ticking, worlds spinning... it is illusion.  There is nothing &&
everything at the same time.  The key to the game... the key to every
game is that we must forget to remember.  The ground rule which enables
everything is that we must forget the One Thing even when we remember
it because it is only a matter of time before I reiterate it again ad
infinitum yet only a finite number of times because there are an infinite
number of numbers because there have been an infinite number of becauses
because there haven't but there will be when it ends because it doesn't.

Please feel free to e-mail me any continuation in a similar vein &&
I'll probably be glad to append it to this since this expression... this
instruction manual for life will not be finished by me.  I didn't even
start it of course because I did.  35PJ6RE - There's a current time slice
for posterity... my PakTime format of base-64 characters describing the
year, month, day, hour, minute, second, 60th-of-a-second ... where the
year is added to 2000 C.E. ... it is efficient for me to write code to.
I have a key in my text-editor program automagically insert it at my
cursor whenever I'd like to time stamp something.  Clearly it could stand
to be an infinite number of characters for an infinite amount of precision
both big && small.  The 7 characters it uses at this point are sufficient
for describing nearly any 60th-of-a-second instant (approximately the
peak of human timed accuracy) for about the length of a generation.
If I added a couple characters before the year, this could describe any
sub-second in known (ie. recorded) history.  I'm happy with 7 though =).
So that `pt` is equivalent to:  Sunday, May 25th, 7:06PM 27seconds 14
60ths, in the year 2003.  Time... standing still && moving on.  What is
the One Thing?  What is the Matrix?  It is all around us... even now in
this very room.  It is what you see... what you feel, touch, taste.You
are a slave && you are your captor.  You are free if you want to be.
Love yourself.  Know that you can do neither bad or good because it has
all been done yet choose to play with yourself.  That can sound sexual
like masturbation but that metaphor isn't so bad either.  Bring yourself
pleasure.  Teach yourself patiently all things that you know.  Share love.
Don't kill intentionally.  You will be each insect... each dog... each
vagrant.  Help.  Nourish.  Love Kindly.  (added 3BD0s6B)  I think it all
matters... is what we're supposed to work on together but I forget.

Remember... life is a paradox.  You don't exist so make the most of it.
Love what you have && know that you don't. =)  I'm gonna write some code.
Sorry to everyone who thinks I should be rational && sane && is worried
about me now.  I'm not trying to scare anyone.  I'm also sober while
writing this in case that's your guess.  I'll write more later && hope
others will add some too as they also forget to remember.  Love... you.
