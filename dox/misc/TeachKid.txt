53KKtr6 Something I Think Kids Should Know (&& Adults Too)...

Drugs (both legal && illegal) are essential to life.  People have been
voluntarily engaging in the consumption of mind-altering substances
since anything was voluntary.  Alcohol && Marijuana && Caffeine &&
Cocaine... && Food && Air... we all consume stuff that changes us...
some slightly... some dramatically.  When we know what it does && we
choose to ingest it, it is our free choice to make.  Nobody can deny
us that... however the parenthetical in the first sentence is the
interloper.  The coercive governments of the world wish to pass laws
to make free choice illegal.  They want to take involuntary tax-payer
money to fund propaganda.  They buy commercials to advertise the
excitement to be had by joining their military initiators of force.
They buy commercials to tell you how bad drugs are.  They want to
force you to do what they say.  The governments are the slave-drivers.
They are backed by their military might.  Now they are mildly
benevolent today because enrollment is voluntary but a draft is the
opposite of freedom.  If people believe in the patriotic need to
defend their territory, their worthwhile way-of-life... then by
definition, you won't have to force people to participate if your
collective military cause has merit.  It is about freedom.  Be free.
Take drugs when you feel like it.  You already do.  Just allow
yourself to understand that everything has its place... including
anything you or someone else labels "bad".  Indeed the very present
manifestations of government have their place right here even though
I && many others label them "bad".  Hopefully more people will awaken
to the possible communal human understanding of freedom... without
governments or borders.  A world we all share.  Violence relegated
to voluntary participation, fantasy escapades, or freak accidents.
Maybe the "freak" is melodramatic.  Wooo!  hehe.  *poof* like that.
What do you know?  Do you live by the sword?  Do you live at all?
I am stoned!  && drunk.  && high... Do you feel me?  I fly.
Haha... let me come back down && touch base again. =)  So I guess
you noticed I included freak accidents (or just accidents if you
prefer) && well... they don't deserve inclusion because they are
already part of the voluntary participation group.  You see... I'm
sorry to patronize you about this but many people just don't quite
grasp this utterly basic principle... you see, an accident is par-
for-the-course.  You know that crossing the street is dangerous yet
you do it.  You know that drinking makes you drunk.  You know that
riding motorcycles is more dangerous than driving SUV's.  You know
that guns can kill people.  Be responsible for yourself as you see
fit.  That's all anyone can ever do.  Governments that don't tell
people how to live are better than what we have.  I look forward to
when we all wake up together.  I guess that means we all sleep
together.  That means we both make love && get rest.  That means I
get carried away in silliness.  Do you follow?  Time for another
drink... another hit... another tab... another breath.  Live free.
I could pull it back in again ("tag") but I'll let it hang out.
Recognize the ebb-&&-flow... of life.  Play.  Go at your pace
(which may well be shared voluntarily with someone else).  Have fun.
Don't live dead.  Die living!  Such is my aim.  Oh so there's no
difference you might say.  You'd be right.  That goes back to the
accidents.  An aim is necessarily arbitrary.  Mine is different from
yours but maybe there will be magnetism... maybe there will occur a
radical change... or a glacial one.  Uggh.  We could go fast
together.  But how arbitrary... 55 miles-per-hour or how many X are
ok for Y?  Who should decide?  The one who's there knowing that they
impact the interconnected web of humanity.  The good && the bad we
each seek every day makes what is all around us.  We each shape the
rest of the cosmos in the way we each wish to see it.  We each make
all these impacts... like every keystroke here.  Do you understand
now?  We communicate our ideas && make our choices.  Some choices
have been forcing ideas.  Those ideas are flawed.  I can't do better
than I can do... but I can't do worse either.  Can you hear me?
I'm trying to communicate with you. ;)  I am a dork.  I live at
dorksville place in kaka-town.  Can I buy you some poop?  The man,
the myth.  Choosing to shape the universe tiny dung-by-dung... &&
dreaming that others can know they do the same.  What a wild dream?!
A wish.  A hope.  I am an insolent bastard.  A mocker && a child.
Banished to playing in whatever form it may take... yet shaping
play to take whatever form.  A side of a coin.  A Yin&&Yang.  A
rising sun over an earth.  Far enough away that it is small enough
to cast a cylindrical shape of light && other energy onto our
planet illuminating nearly half of our home.  The energy we need &&
can't bear in large quantities.  Could our earth stumble into our
sun? ... Most certainly.  Could this breath be our last? ... Well
it wasn't but it could have been.  We just do what we can.  What
else can I do?  Do you have a good idea too?  Excellent.  I don't
have to share but choosing to is sensible to me.  The limits must
be defined voluntarily && personally.  Let my people go.  The
governments need to back down off the rest of the people.  The
slaves are the cotton-pickers && gears of the force machine but we
have rumblings... unsettlements... altercations && incursions...
we are forced to support the force but we're free to say we don't
want to... How fscked up is that!?  How widely can I publicize
this?  Would anyone care?  I guess what matters is that I do.
Maybe I'm wrong... as I have been wrong myriad times && lived to
tell about it.  I just try to be right... to find the truth
whether common or unique... && share it however I can.  Maybe
that's playfulness.  Maybe it's stonerness.  Maybe it's gen-X-ness.
Maybe it's trendiness.  Maybe it's nerdiness.  Whatever.  It's
just be you.  Choose your path whenever you want to.  Leave it
whenever you don't.  Play.  Rest.  It is the cycle.  Of life.
Live it.  Teach it.  Practice it.  I guess you could add: Tire &&
Wake if you wanted to zoom in a bit.  Maybe you play with yourself
&& maybe you play with other people.  Feel free to do so.  Maybe
you need to work to facilitate play.  Do so.  Maybe you need to
care about coercive governments to stop stifling play.  Maybe you
worry about being who you are.  It's tough to do that.  But it's
those others that want to teach that.  Don't practice stilting
yourself unless your desires are to inflict involuntary harm.  The
only restraint called for is initiated offensive force.  I'd say
try not to throw tantrums here except that recalling whatever of
this text I can, it seems transcribed excrement... that I thrash
about as an infant wallowing in self-pity && struggling to find
meaning in the meaningless.  Struggling to orient myself &&
everything else.  How ambitious?  How grandiose?  Full of yourself
&& full of others.  Hypocracy.  Idiocy.  Insanity.  Whatever dude.
I'll go toe-to-toe with it.  Even if I lose, I stood.  I chose to
stand.  Choose to stand for honor, integrity, freedom, &&
cooperation.  Be a modern samurai who protects people more than
power or money.  I guess also be the ninja assassin.  Honor only
exists relative to dishonor.  Hopefully most will be samurai when
they wake && choose.  I am over-dramatizing this.  Acting as if
everything is black or white.  Maybe I should.  Maybe I shouldn't.
Either way, that's my choice && I choose it.  So it's a bit
alarmist && only tempered by oppressive force.  Force is only
tempered by lack of funding.  Sure, it's all along a spectrum of
possible good or bad.  Governments could be much worse.  They
could be much better.  Same could be said for corporations &&
courtrooms.  Same could be said for any individual... however I
think the point is to grow all of it together.  Interweave your
way.  Tie knots && loose others.  Play in the web of life.  Is
it still hanging out?  Oh sorry kid... you're not to see or know
any truth until you're old enough to handle it.  You must be
shielded from the evil out there.  Impressionability.  Children
are shaped as is our universe.  Who will they choose to be?
They will explore their playground.  They will discover the
benefits && ills of drugs && governments.  Each have had their
place in history but hopefully both can be confined to voluntary
participation in the future.  Free choice.  Free ideas.  Free
communcation.  Free software.  Live free && teach others this way.
