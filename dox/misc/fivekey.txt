                        5-KEY NOTES

Ok, I'm trying to develop a method to utilize only five keys of the keyboard but
still have the ability to type any letter.  Hopefully if done well, typing
efficiency should improve drastically with practice since your five fingers
never need to move to other keys... in essence they can remain in the home row
during an entire typing session.

ok let's say we have five keys...
    0   1   2   3   4
   " " "j" "k" "l" ";"

one decimal integer may represent any of the five keys being pressed or
released.   I'll refer to one of these integers from now on as an
Action Marker.   ie...
    0   =   " " pressed         5   =   " " released
    1   =   "j" pressed         6   =   "j" released
    2   =   "k" pressed         7   =   "k" released
    3   =   "l" pressed         8   =   "l" released
    4   =   ";" pressed         9   =   ";" released

I am hoping to have two modes of operation.  Mode one should be able to tally
which of the five keys has been pressed before all have been released.  Mode
two should be more complex but allow for infinite combinations among only the
five keys.  Mode one will only denote keys PRESSED during a single character
entry because it will set a bit whenever the corresponding key is pressed.
Thus mode one has 31 possible key combinations.  There would be 32
combinations (2^5) but I'm not including all 0's because that's when no key is
being pressed.  Their bit representations would look like this...

key: 01234   01234   01234   01234   01234   01234   01234   01234
    {10000} {00001} {10001} {00110} {11010} {10011} {00111} {10111}
    {01000} {11000} {01100} {00101} {11001} {01110} {11110} {01111}
    {00100} {10100} {01010} {00011} {10110} {01101} {11101} {11111}
    {00010} {10010} {01001} {11100} {10101} {01011} {11011}

Mode two will consider when each key is pressed and released and is strict
about the order.  A single character entry may be comprised of an infinite
(only limited by computer memory) number of key presses and releases.  The
entry is complete when all keys have been released.  The entered sequence may
be represented by a list containing the Action Markers in the order in which
they occurred.  These lists will be referred to as Marker Lists from now on.
A sample Marker List may look like any of these...

    {013865}
    {05}
    {12349876}
    {01616165}

Let me illustrate the main difference between Mode one and Mode two.
Let's take the first Mode one bit string that contains two set bits...

    {11000}

    Now this 6th element of the Mode one set can be represented by an infinite
    number of Mode two Marker Lists.  ie...

    {0165}
    {0156}
    {1056}
    {1065}
    {01616165}
    {016156}
        *NOTE:  all mode 1 strings are 5 bits in size & all mode 2 strings
                contain an even # of action markers since every key pressed
                must later be released

    The above 6 Mode two Marker Lists are entirely distinct and may each
    represent different characters or actions in Mode two but each one would
    yield the bit string {11000} if implemented in Mode one.  Hopefully it is
    clear now how potentially powerful Mode two is and how much relatively
    simpler Mode one is to use and you'd only have to remember 31 key sequences
    enough to represent the alphabet with 5 sequences left to enable you to
    choose 5 additional characters (you'd probably want one to be delete or
    backspace) to reside in those sequences.  A potential way to greatly
    improve the availiable characters in Mode one would be to have some or all
    of the remaining 5 sequences act as sort of shift toggles which when
    entered, shift the values contained in each of the standard 26 alphabet
    sequences.  Not unsimilar to CAPS-LOCK.

If I am able to put enough time into this project as I would like to (which is
pretty unlikely) then I aim to implement a five key chooser so that the user
may use any five keys on the keyboard to input their entries.  I also hope to
build into it an efficient method of representing the most frequently occurring
characters by the least possible key combinations.  This method will hopefully
be used to obtain an acceptable default character set but all sequences may be
reassigned by the user to entirely new characters so that the program can be
customizable enough to cater to particular user needs.  If I am able to
complete the above then I would be greatly interested in adapting the program
to operate on a five or more button peripheral such as a 5-button mouse (if one
exists).  If you like this program and practice enough then hopefully you will
be able to type an entire text document with one hand leaving the other hand
free to manipulate a mouse, hold a cigarette, or scratch your balls.  I have
dreams that one day a five-button ergonomic hand grip may be used in place of
having a user pick 5 keys on a 101+ keyboard that they'd like to use.  A tennis
ball type object or a pistol handle with buttons placed appropriately close to
where the fingertips lay sound like they'd be well suited to support this
program.

I hope you are able to exploit this program to its potential.
Happy typing. =)
