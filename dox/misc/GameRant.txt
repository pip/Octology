Original "Pip's Top-10 Video Game Hate List":
1) the inability to remap buttons easily from anywhere it could possibly make sense to (a corollary to this hate rule is: "stupid default control schemes")
2) bad framerate (Usually anything less than 60fps perturbs me.)
3) unskippable cutscenes
4) loading times
5) heavy RPG elements (I prefer to skill up my own play abilities rather than arbitrarily leveling up some initially gimped character.  Can you imagine if
     Street Fighter let you grind to get a Level 60 Ryu that can't be hit by newbs?  The gamers should skill up as they play, not the avatars.)
6) unresponsive core game mechanics (like overly elaborate jumping animations in a platformer or attacks in a brawler) or core game mechanics with poor
     feedback (e.g., Under identical conditions, multiple perfectly timed passes and receptions in Madden will be dropped according to retarded real-world
     completion percentages of the QB and Receiver.)
7) online lag
8) AI in general but particularly those that cheat or are annoyingly retarded
9) flimsy gameplay systems (e.g., infinite combos, too much invunerability, too much reward/incentive to do inane things... like wait around... I'm looking in
     your direction Wolverine ;) )
10) getting lost (i.e., giant levels with no map [or an unhelpful one] and no guiding indicators or no clear idea how to progress when you want to)

Honorable Mentions:
-invisible walls
-terrain pop-up
-slow save game processes and poor management of multiple memory cards
-crappy or absent calibration screens for gamma or HD settings
-confined levels when expansive play-spaces would be more fun

Suggested Research Topics:
-button mapping interfaces and profiles
-input sequences and patterns
-LOD
-fast development iterations
-guidelines/metrics for everything
