3BI6DV1 I know this is a remarkably unpopular... even considered evil
thought but my sister's visit has caused me to think more deeply about
the man / woman relationship && the issue of equality.  If equality is
the goal (as much as possible), then it seems that the issue of spousal
abuse (&& related) is resolved by the Libertarian rule that initiation
of force is not right.  I have been unsure about that rule... thinking
there may be exceptions where something so wrong is said or done that
force is an appropriate response... but now I think maybe there aren't
good examples of that.

3BI6Mre Another thing is I thought that to find forever love, true
love meant that I would have to just never give up... basically at
any cost... but reading Boundaries is teaching me that I probably
should have a boundary where I should give up... deciding where that
is && being certain it has been breached is hard.  It should also
be communicated as clearly as possible.  I need to stop being so
self-important && aggressive.  Really chill out.  Really get into
chatting with Dad on a personal level && stop telling people about
our past.  I'm no Messiah.  Don't go so overboard about Matrix or
Snow Crash.  They're cool but not the tale of your life.  Stop thinking
your autobiography is so interesting... you are a joe.  Think about it.
Accept the truth.  You need to grow up && not be ultra-passionate about
so much.  Your melodramatic tendencies are rarely appropriate so try
harder to temper them... && stop talking to everyone around you about
everything in your life.  Privacy && secrets make you safer... but
maybe safety is overrated... or it depends on the situation && risk
involved of course... && the need to be safe && private mean much more
isolation... && concentration... neither of which are inherently good or
bad... even in extreme?  Ironic that I even agonize over agonizing... =)
