1.  INTRODUCTION
    ============

    The OrBit Editor is a program that allows you to quickly and
    easily view or edit any type of file.  This program is useful when
    there is a need to see or modify the exact contents of a file.

    The program provides a simultaneous ASCII and numeric display.
    The numeric display can show file information in decimal or
    hexadecimal form.  Changes can easily be made in either ASCII or
    numeric form.

    The editor features a fast and easy to use interface that requires
    very little learning.  All the options available to the user are
    clearly displayed as buttons at the bottom of the screen.

    An important feature, and one that most editors do not provide, is
    support for 43 and 50 line mode.  These extended displays increase
    productivity by providing a larger view into the file.

    We hope that you find this program not only useful, but a pleasure
    to use.  Since it is distributed as "shareware," we encourage you
    to share it with anyone who might also find it useful.  If you do
    find the program useful and wish to continue using it beyond the
    30 day trial period, we ask that you register it with OrBit
    software.  When you register your copy of the editor, you will
    receive the most recent version of the editor in the mail, be
    entitled to technical support, and be notified of major product
    updates.  Please see the section titled "REGISTERING THE EDITOR"
    for complete details.

2.  INSTALLING THE EDITOR
    =====================

    The OrBit Editor is easy to install onto your system.  You may
    have received the editor on a single floppy disk or perhaps you
    downloaded it from a bulletin board system.  The editor can be
    installed onto your hard drive or run off a floppy disk.

    Note: If you are unfamiliar with the process of copying files or
    modifying your PATH statement, we suggest consulting your MS-DOS
    manual for help.  If you still do not feel comfortable with these
    steps then we suggest getting help from a friend or from person
    who setup your system.

    The preferred way to install the OrBit Editor onto your system is
    to create a new directory on your hard drive, copy the editor
    files into it, and then add this directory to your PATH.

    Lets go through these steps in more detail.  The first step is to
    create a directory to hold the OrBit Editor files.  On most
    systems the C: drive is your hard drive (if this is not the case
    on your system or you prefer to install to a different drive,

                                Page 3


OrBit Editor (TM) Version 1.0            Copyright 1993 OrBit Software

    simply substitute C: with the desired drive).  From the MS-DOS
    prompt (If you are inside of Windows, exit to MS-DOS) type the
    following command:

        MD C:\ORBIT

    This command will create a directory named \ORBIT on your C:
    drive.  The next step is to copy the OrBit Editor files into this
    directory.  Change to the drive and directory where the OrBit
    Editor files are located and type:

       COPY O.EXE C:\ORBIT
       COPY README.TXT C:\ORBIT
       COPY ORBIT.DOC C:\ORBIT
       COPY INVOICES.TXT C:\ORBIT

    This will copy the OrBit Editor files into the \ORBIT directory on
    your hard drive.

    The final installation step is to add the \ORBIT directory to your
    system PATH.  The PATH is an environment variable that is usually
    set in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  The PATH is a list of directories
    that the system will search when looking for an executable file.
    By adding the \ORBIT directory to the PATH, you can execute the
    OrBit Editor from any directory by simply typing the name of the
    editor (for more information on executing the editor, please see
    the next section titled RUNNING THE EDITOR).

    To add the \ORBIT directory to your PATH, you will need to edit
    your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  The MS-DOS EDIT command can be used to
    edit a file such as this (please see your MS-DOS manual for more
    information on editing text files).  Once you bring up your
    AUTOEXEC.BAT file in an editor, you should see a line that starts
    out PATH= and then a list of directories follows.  Below is an
    example of what your PATH command might look like:

       PATH=C:\DOS

    To add the \ORBIT directory to the path, simply add a semicolon to
    the end of the list of directories and then type C:\ORBIT.  Below
    is an example:

       PATH=C:\DOS;C:\ORBIT

    After completing this modification, you will need to reboot your
    system to have it take effect.  After rebooting you will ready to
    begin using the OrBit Editor!

3.  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
    ===================

    The OrBit Editor will run on IBM PCs and compatible computers with
    a minimum of 256K of memory and running MS-DOS version 3.00 or
    later.

    The OrBit Editor supports a wide range of video configurations.
    The following types of video are supported:

         VGA     EGA     CGA     MCGA     MONOCHROME

    The editor can be installed onto your hard drive or run from a
    floppy disk.

4.  RUNNING THE EDITOR
    ==================

    To execute the editor from the MS-DOS command prompt, type the
    name of the editor followed by the name of the file you wish to
    edit.  Below is an example:

     O MYFILE.BIN

    O is the name of the OrBit Editor executable file and MYFILE.BIN
    is the name of the file to be edited.  The full command line
    syntax is:

     O <file> <switches>

    There are several command line switches that can be specified when
    loading the editor.  Command line switches are used to give the
    editor specific instructions.  Below is a list of the available
    command line switches:


      /25    This switch sets the size of the edit display to 25
             vertical lines.

      /43    This switch sets the size of the edit display to 43
             vertical lines. Please note that this mode requires an
             EGA or VGA display.

      /50    This switch set the size of the edit display to 50
             vertical lines.  Please note that this mode requires
             a VGA display.

      /D     This switch sets the numeric display to decimal mode at
             load time.

      /L     This switch disables the option buttons that appear at
             the bottom of the screen.  This increases the size of
             the edit region.

                                Page 5

OrBit Editor (TM) Version 1.0            Copyright 1993 OrBit Software


      /M     This switch instructions the editor to maximize the size
             of the edit region.  The editor will automatically
             select highest resolution text mode available and
             disable the option buttons.  This switch will provide
             the maximum size of edit display possible.

      /R     This switch allows read-only viewing of the file.  This
             switch is ideal when you want to view a file but not
             modify it.

      /V     This switch enables alternate video access.  This switch
             should only be used when direct video access is not
             supported on your system.  See TIPS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
             for more information.

      /B     This switch makes the editor display more readable on
             some systems with monochrome monitors.  When this switch
             is used, the editor display appears only in black and
             white (no color)

      /Z     This switch disables mouse support.  This switch is most
             useful in situations where your mouse is not Microsoft
             mouse compatible.

    Command line switches are added after the filename.  The below
    example:

      O MYFILE.BIN /50

    Edits the file MYFILE.BIN and tells the editor to use 50 line
    mode.

    The below example:

      O MYFILE.BIN /Z /R /43

    Edits the file MYFILE.BIN, disables the mouse, sets read-only
    mode, and sets 43 line mode.

    Command line switches can be specified in any order after the
    filename.  Each command line argument must be separated by a
    space.

    If no command line switches are specified, the editor will use its
    default settings, which are: opening the file in read/write mode,
    hexadecimal display, options buttons, and mouse enabled.  The
    editor will match the current video mode when in 25. 43. or 50
    line mode.

5.  THE EDITOR DISPLAY
    ==================

    Once the editor is loaded you will see the main edit display.  A
    data display occupies the majority of the screen while a set of
    editor options is presented along the bottom.

    The data display shows the contents of the file beginning with the
    first byte in the upper left hand corner.  Each data line begins
    with an offset value that represents the position within the file.
    The data display consists of two distinct regions.

    On the left is the numeric region that can display data in decimal
    or hexadecimal form.  This region is useful because it displays
    the exact value of the data within the file.

    To the right of the numeric region is the ASCII region.  This
    region displays the ASCII representation of the numeric data on
    the left.  This region is very useful for reading text contained
    within the file.

    On the far right of the data display is the scroll bar.  The
    scroll bar is oriented vertically with an up arrow at the top of
    the bar and a down arrow at the bottom.  Between the arrows is a
    block (known as the thumb) which represents the general location
    within the file.  When the thumb is located at the top of the
    scroll bar the data being viewed is from the beginning of the
    file.  As you move further on in the file, the thumb will move
    down towards the bottom of the scroll bar.  When you finally reach
    the end of the file, the thumb will be at the bottom of the scroll
    bar.  The thumb is a convenient and easy way to gauge your current
    position within the file.

    You will notice that one byte of data in the numeric region is
    highlighted and contains a flashing cursor.  This is the location
    of the edit cursor that indicates the byte that will be changed if
    a modification is entered.

6.  GETTING AROUND IN THE EDITOR
    ============================

    This section describes how to control the edit cursor and make
    modifications using the keyboard and mouse.

    6.1  Keyboard Control
    ---------------------

        The edit cursor is located within the edit area and is used to
        select a specific byte of data to change.  The edit cursor is
        seen as a highlighted and/or underlined field within the edit
        area.  The edit cursor can be moved to any location within the
        file by using the cursor keys on the keyboard or by
        positioning it with the mouse pointer.

        To move the edit cursor with the keyboard, the four arrow keys
        can be used.  The right arrow key will move the edit cursor to
        the right while the left arrow moves the edit cursor to the
        left.  If the edit cursor happens to be at end of a row of
        data (far right) when the right arrow key is pressed, the edit
        cursor will move down to the first field (far left) of the
        line below.  Accordingly, when the edit cursor is on the first
        field of a data line, pressing the left arrow key will move it
        to the end of the line above.  The up and down arrow keys move
        the edit cursor directly up or directly down one edit line.

        The edit region can be scrolled up or down by moving the edit
        cursor to the upper or lower edges of the edit region and then
        pressing the up or down arrow key to scroll in the
        corresponding direction.  In addition to scrolling one line at
        a time, the 'page up' and 'page down' keys on your keyboard
        can be used to move an entire page up or down respectively.
        The Home and End keys on your keyboard are convenient ways of
        moving directly to the top or bottom of the file.

        As previously mentioned, there are two data regions; the
        numeric region on the left, and the ASCII region on the right.
        The TAB key on the keyboard is used to move the edit cursor
        between the two regions.  Pressing the TAB key while in the
        numeric region will cause it to jump to the corresponding byte
        of data in the ASCII region.  Pressing TAB again will move the
        edit cursor back to its original position in the numeric
        region.

        In addition to using the keyboard to control the edit cursor,
        the keyboard can be used to issue editor commands.  For
        example, a dialog containing keyboard help can be brought up
        by pressing the function key F1 on the keyboard.  The
        remaining editor commands are described in detail in the
        EDITOR OPTIONS section later in this manual.



                                Page 8

OrBit Editor (TM) Version 1.0            Copyright 1993 OrBit Software

        The below table provides a list of the available keyboard
        commands.  Please note that some of these functions are
        described later in this manual.

          Keyboard Key   Description
        =============================================================
          Left arrow     Moves the edit cursor to the left.
          Right arrow    Moves the edit cursor to the right.
          Up arrow       Moves the edit cursor up one data line.
          Down arrow     Moves the edit cursor down one data line.
          ESCAPE         Exit the editor, prompts to save file.
          F1             Displays the help information.
          F2             Search the file for a byte sequence.
          F3             Toggle the numeric display between the
                         decimal and hexadecimal view.
          F4             Displays registration information.
          F10            Resets changes to the file.
          Page Up        Moves the edit region up one page of data.
          Page Down      Moves the edit region down one page of data.
          Home           Moves the edit cursor to the top of the
                         file.
          END            Moves the edit cursor to the last page of
                         data.
          BACKSPACE      Resets the byte under the edit cursor to
                         its original value and moves the edit
                         cursor left.
        =============================================================

    6.2  Mouse Control
    ------------------

        Using the mouse within the editor provides a quick way to move
        within the file and select options.

        The mouse cursor can be used to quickly move the edit cursor
        to any field within the edit display.  To select a field,
        simply position the mouse cursor over the field and press the
        left mouse button.  You will see the field highlight when the
        edit cursor moves to it.  The mouse provides an advantage over
        the keyboard controls because it can directly move to any
        field within the numeric or ASCII region.

        To the right of the edit display is the scroll bar.  You will
        find that there is an arrow at the top and bottom of the
        scroll bar.  The edit display can be scrolled up or down by
        clicking the mouse on the corresponding arrow.

        Between the two arrows on the scroll bar you will see a block
        known as the thumb.  The thumb can move to any position
        between the two arrows and represents the data display's
        approximate location within the file.  The thumb can be
        quickly moved to any position by positioning the mouse cursor
        over it and holding down the left mouse button.  While holding

                                Page 9

OrBit Editor (TM) Version 1.0            Copyright 1993 OrBit Software

        down the left mouse button, move the mouse up or down to
        position the thumb.  As the thumb moves, the display will
        update to show data from the corresponding location within the
        file.  When you are done positioning the thumb simply release
        the mouse button.

        There is one more way to position the thumb.  This method
        involves clicking the mouse on the scroll bar somewhere
        between the thumb and the ending arrows.  When you click the
        mouse in this region, the thumb will move one position toward
        the mouse cursor.

        Below the edit display you will see a row of six option
        buttons.  Each button contains a description of its purpose
        and the keyboard command to active it.  The mouse can be used
        here as an alternate to the keyboard.  To select an option,
        simply click the left mouse button on the desired option
        button.  You will see the button move (representing it being
        pressed) as the option is selected.

    6.3  Making Modifications
    -------------------------

        This section describes how to make file modifications.

        The edit cursor is represented by a highlighted field within
        the edit display.  When a modification is entered, the byte
        under the edit cursor is modified.

        To make a modification, position the edit cursor on the byte
        you wish to modify.  If you are within the numeric region,
        position the cursor on the first digit of the decimal or
        hexadecimal number.  To make the change, simply type the new
        value on the keyboard.  You will notice that the field turns
        red indicating it has been modified.  After a modification has
        been entered the edit cursor will automatically moves forward
        to the next byte.  If you made a mistake or wish to change the
        previous value, you can use the left arrow key to move back to
        the modified field and try again.

        If after making a change you decide that you want the original
        value back, move the edit cursor to the desired field and
        press the BACKSPACE key on your keyboard.  The field will
        return to its original (unmodified) value and will turn white
        indicating it is unmodified.  If you decide that you want the
        entire file returned to its original state, choose the RESET
        CHANGES option by pressing F10 on the keyboard or clicking on
        the appropriate option button with the mouse.

        When you make a change to the file, it is not written to the
        disk until you exit the editor and choose to save.  This means
        that you are free to make changes throughout the file and can
        wait until exiting to decide if you wish to save changes.

        Since modified bytes appear red, you can easily identify
        changed areas when scrolling through the file.

7.  EDITOR OPTIONS
    ==============

    This section describes each editor option in detail.  An editor
    option can be activated either by pressing a keyboard function key
    or by clicking the mouse on an option button.

    7.1  DONE - ESCAPE Key
    ----------------------
        This option is used when you are done viewing or modifying a
        file and wish to exit the program.  This option can be
        selected by either pressing the F1 key on the keyboard or by
        clicking the mouse on the DONE button.  If you have made
        modification to the file the editor will ask you if you wish
        to save these modifications.  You can press 'Y' to have the
        modifications saved or press 'N' to exit without saving.

    7.2  HELP - F1 Key
    ------------------
        This option displays a summary of the options available within
        the editor.  To return to the editor simply press a key or
        press the left mouse button.

    7.3  SEARCH FILE - F2 Key
    -------------------------
        This option provides a facility to search the file for
        particular text strings or sequences of bytes.  To active the
        SEARCH FILE option simply press the F2 function key on the
        keyboard or click the mouse pointer on the SEARCH FILE button.

        After selecting this option you will see the SEARCH FILE
        dialog on the screen.  This dialog provides a very flexible
        interface for inputting the search string in ASCII, decimal,
        or hexadecimal form.  The cursor will begin in the ASCII field
        where you can type a text string.  As you type, you will
        notice that the two fields below (Hex and Decimal)
        automatically update to show the corresponding values in the
        ASCII field.  This is because all three fields (ASCII, Hex,
        and Decimal) represent the one search value.  Each of these
        fields show the search value in its own format.  You can move
        freely between these fields by pressing the up and down arrow
        keys on your keyboard and move left or right by pressing the
        left or right keys.

        This interface may seem unusual at first, however it can prove
        to be very useful in some situations.  For example, if you
        needed to search for an ASCII string followed by a zero you
        would start out by typing the ASCII string in the ASCII field
        and then move down into the hex (or Decimal) field and enter

                               Page 11

OrBit Editor (TM) Version 1.0            Copyright 1993 OrBit Software

        the zero.  Since you can't enter the ASCII equivalent of zero
        in the ASCII region, it was necessary to move down into one of
        the numeric fields to enter the value of zero.

        The final field on the SEARCH FILE dialog (labeled 'Begin
        search at') specifies where in the file the search will begin.
        The search can begin at two locations, either at the top of
        the file or at the current edit cursor location.  Once you
        have moved to this field by pressing the down arrow key you
        can toggle its state by pressing the space bar.  When you
        select CURSOR LOCATION, the search will begin at the current
        edit cursor location and continue down in the file until the
        end of the file is reached.

        Once you have entered your search string and have selected the
        location to begin the search, press the F2 function key to
        begin the search.  If you do not wish to perform a search you
        can press the ESCAPE key to abort and return to the main edit
        display.

        After pressing the F2 key, the editor will begin searching the
        file.  If a match is found the editor will stop and display
        the location of the matching string.  The edit cursor will
        highlight the first byte of the string.  You have two options
        at this point, you can press F2 to continue the search or
        press ESCAPE to discontinue the search leaving the edit cursor
        on the found string.

    7.4  TOGGLE VIEW - F3
    ---------------------
        By pressing the F3 key or clicking on the Toggle View button
        he numeric display will alternate between a hexadecimal and
        decimal view.  In the hexadecimal view 16 bytes of data are
        displayed on each edit line.  When you change to the decimal
        view, you will notice that only 10 bytes of data are displayed
        on each edit line.

    7.5  HOW TO REGISTER - F4
    -------------------------
        This option provides information on how to register your copy
        of the OrBit Editor with OrBit Software.

    7.6  RESET CHANGES - F10
    ------------------------
        This option will return the file to its original unmodified
        state.  All changes that you have entered will be lost.  If
        you wish to reset only a particular change you can use the
        BACKSPACE key.  For more information on the use of the
        BACKSPACE key, please see the section titled "Making
        Modifications".

8.  ERROR MESSAGES
    ==============

    While using the OrBit Editor you may encounter an error message if
    there is a problem such as reading or writing to the file being
    edited.  Even though errors of this type should be very uncommon,
    the editor is equipped to let the user know when one does occur.
    If an error occurs while inside the editor a message box will
    appear indicating which error occurred and giving you the option
    to retry or quit the editor.  Please note that if you select to
    quit, the changes you have made to the file will be lost.  Below
    is a description of the possible error messages:

    File not found
    --------------
    This message indicates that the file specified could not be found.
    Verify that the file was spelled correctly and that the file
    extension was specified.

    Invalid path
    ------------
    If the path specified does not exist this message will be
    displayed.  Verify that the drive and path are specified
    correctly.

    Out of file handles
    -------------------
    MS-DOS uses a file handle each time a file is opened.  This error
    indicates that there were no file handles available to open the
    file.  To increase the number of file handles available on your
    system, please read about the FILES command in your MS-DOS manual.

    Access denied
    -------------
    This message indicates that the file is currently being used by
    another process or is read only.  The MS-DOS ATTRIB command can be
    used to remove the read-only attribute from an MS-DOS file.  For
    more information on the ATTRIB command, please see your MS-DOS
    manual. If you are editing a file that is on a network, it is
    possible that another user currently has the file open.  Try using
    the /R switch to open the file for read-only.

    Unable to open file
    -------------------
    This error indicates that MS-DOS was unable to open the file.

    Insufficient memory
    -------------------
    If this error occurs then your system does not have enough free
    memory to execute the editor.  To execute the OrBit Editor a
    minimum of 128K is needed.  Please see your MS-DOS manual for ways
    of increasing your available memory.

OrBit Editor (TM) Version 1.0            Copyright 1993 OrBit Software

    Memory allocation error
    -----------------------
    This message indicates that an error occurred allocating memory
    for the editor's use.  If this error occurs, you may want to shut
    down your system and retry after rebooting.

    The disk is write protected
    ---------------------------
    This message indicates that the floppy disk containing the file
    you wish to edit is write protected.  Write protected means that
    the disk cannot be written to because the write protect notch
    (physically on the disk) is covered or slid into the write
    protected position.  If this error occurs, remove the disk from
    your floppy drive and remove the write protection.  Next place the
    disk back into your floppy drive and select 'R' to retry.  If you
    wish to abort your changes, you can select "Q" to exit the editor
    without saving the modifications.

    Sharing violation
    ------------------
    This message indicates that the file is currently being used by
    another process.  If you are editing a file that is on a network,
    then it is possible that another user is using the file.  If you
    are running under a multi-tasking operating system such as
    Windows, Windows NT, or OS/2 it is possible that another task is
    using the file.

    General read error
    ------------------
    This error indicates that MS-DOS was unable to read data from the
    file that is being edited.  If this error persists, even after
    several retries, it is possible that the file is damaged.  If the
    file being edited is on a floppy disk, please verify that the
    floppy disk is properly inserted into the floppy disk drive.

    General write error
    -------------------
    This error indicates that MS-DOS was unable to write data to the
    file that is being edited.  If this error persists, even after
    retries, it is possible that the file is damaged.  If the file
    being edited is on a floppy disk, please verify that the floppy
    disk is properly inserted into the floppy disk drive.

    File seek error
    ---------------
    This error indicates that MS-DOS was unable to perform a file
    operation on the file being edited.  If this error persists after
    several retries, it is possible that the file is damaged.  If the
    file being edited is on a floppy disk, please verify that the
    floppy disk is properly inserted into the floppy disk drive.

    50 line mode not supported
    --------------------------

                               Page 14

OrBit Editor (TM) Version 1.0            Copyright 1993 OrBit Software

    This error indicates that your system cannot support 50 line mode.
    50 line mode is only supported on systems with VGA graphics.

    43 line mode not supported
    --------------------------
    This error indicates that your system cannot support 43 line mode.
    43 line mode is only supported on systems with EGA or VGA
    graphics.

9.  EDITING FILES
    =============

    People edit files for many reasons. Sometimes specific changes
    need to be made to a file and the user is familiar with the file
    being edited.  Other times a user may not be as familiar as he
    would like with the file's format but still needs to make a
    modification.

    Any time you are going to modify a file it is important to make a
    backup of the original file before proceeding.  This will allow
    you to revert back to the original if your changes are
    unsuccessful.  It is also very important to know exactly what you
    are modifying within a file.  Editing files such as executables or
    database files is extremely risky if you are not completely
    familiar with their internal layout.  If you make uninformed
    modifications to these types of files it is very likely they will
    no longer function properly.

    The OrBit Editor should not be used in place of a word processor
    or database application to modify the those application's data
    files.  Modifying these types of files may cause them to be
    rendered unusable.

    Another common use of an editor is to simply explore data files.
    There are some people (such as the author) who find particular
    pleasure and interest in examining the contents of files.

10. TIPS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
    ========================

    This section contains additional technical information that may
    prove to be useful to the more advanced user.

    10.1 OrBit Editor Files
    -----------------------
        Below is a description of each file included with the editor:

        O.EXE         This is the OrBit Editor executable file.
        ORBIT.DOC     This is the file you are reading.
        INVOICES.TXT  This file contains a registration form that
                      can be printed and used as an invoice.
        README.TXT    This file contains information to get started
                      quickly.

                               Page 15

OrBit Editor (TM) Version 1.0            Copyright 1993 OrBit Software

        VENDOR.DOC    This text file contains information for
                      Shareware vendors and distributors.
        FILE_ID.DIZ   This file contains a brief description of the
                      OrBit Editor and is useful to BBS Sysops.

    10.2 Video Support
    ------------------
        A significant amount of work has gone into ensuring the OrBit
        Editor will be compatible with your system's video card.  Upon
        startup, the OrBit Editor examines the system's video
        configuration and stores information such as the current video
        mode and scan line resolution.  When you exit the editor your
        video will be returned its original state. Even though the
        editor was designed to deal with proprietary video modes, it
        is possible that an unanticipated configuration could cause
        the editor to not display properly.

        If the editor display does not function properly, there are
        several command line options that may correct the problem.

        /V   This switch tells the editor to use the system BIOS for
             all video access.  This switch should be used if your
             system does not support "direct video" writes.

        /B   This switch turns the editor display to black and white.
             No special colors or intensities are used.  Not all
             monochrome configurations can be detected, so this
             switch is useful when the editor does not appear
             correct on a system with a monochrome display.

        /25  This switch instructs the editor to use the common 25
             line video mode.  It is possible that higher line modes
             are not supported on you system (and the editor can not
             detect it).

        /Z   This switch turns the editor's use of the mouse off.  If
             your mouse is of a propriety design, it could be
             incompatible with the editor.  This switch will prevent
             the editor from issuing any mouse service calls
             (INT 33h).

11. REGISTERING THE EDITOR
    ======================

    This section describes how to register your copy of the OrBit
    Editor.

    11.1 Individual Registration
    ----------------------------
        As mentioned above, the OrBit Editor is a "shareware program"
        that can be used for a 30 day trial period.  If after this
        trial period you find the program useful and wish to continue
        using it, you must register it with OrBit Software. Continuing
        to use this program beyond the 30 day trial period is a
        violation of Federal law.

        Due to the low overhead of the shareware distribution method,
        registration for the OrBit Editor is only $25.00 ($30.00
        outside US) including shipping and handling.

        If you find the OrBit Editor useful and you decided to
        continue using it, please take the time to register your copy.
        Below are some of the benefits of becoming a registered user:

          * You will receive the registered version of the editor
            that does not display the registration advertisement
            when exiting.

          * 90 days of free technical support (from the date of
            registration).

          * Automatic notification of major program updates.

          * Reduced price on program updates.

          * 24-hour access to the OrBit Software Bulletin Board
            System (BBS) at (206) 827-9511.

        To register your copy of the OrBit Editor, send a check or
        money order for $25.00 ($30.00 outside US) to:

OrBit Editor (TM) Version 1.0            Copyright 1993 OrBit Software


        A file named INVOICES.TXT is included in the event you need an
        invoice to submit to your purchasing or accounts payable
        department.  This is a simple ASCII text file that can be
        printed to your printer.  For example, if your printer is on
        LPT1 the following command can be executed from the MS-DOS
        prompt:

           COPY INVOICES.TXT LPT1

        This will copy the invoice file to your printer.  Two pages
        will be printed; the first is an invoice for an individual
        registration and the second is an invoice for a site license.

    11.2 Registering a Site License
    -------------------------------
        A site license for the OrBit Editor is available for a very
        reasonable fee of $500 dollars.  This license allows unlimited
        usage of the OrBit Editor within the registered organization
        regardless of the number of individual workstations.

        A company that purchases a site license will receive a
        customized version of the OrBit Editor that displays the
        company as the licensed user.  Site licenses include 6 months
        of free technical support.

        To register a site license for you company, please send a
        check or money order for $500.00 to OrBit Software.  Please
        include your company name, phone number, and optionally the
        name of a person to serve as a contact.  Please also specify
        whether you prefer 5.25 or 3.5 inch floppy diskettes.

        For your convenience, the file INVOICES.TXT contains an
        invoice for registering a site license.  This can be used if
        your accounts payable department prefers an invoice.  Please
        see the previous section for instructions on how to print the
        invoice to your printer.

        Upon receiving your site license registration, OrBit software
        will send you 5 copies of the OrBit Editor that can be used as
        masters for you to duplicate and distribute throughout your
        organization.  This version of the OrBit Editor will have been
        customized to display your company name as the licensed user.

        In addition to the floppy disks you will receive a site
        license certificate and be entitled to a reduced price on
        product updates.

        If your organization contains more than 20 users of the OrBit
        Editor, a site license is a very cost effective means of
        registration.

12. TECHNICAL SUPPORT
    =================

    An advantage of being a registered user is receiving technical
    support.  By registering you will be entitled to 90 days of free
    technical support.  Although every effort has been made to make
    the OrBit Editor easy to use and compatible with a wide range of
    hardware, it is still possible that questions or problems will
    arise.

    There are two ways to receive technical support.  The first (and
    recommended) method is to call the OrBit Bulletin Board System
    (BBS) at (206) 827-9511 using a modem.  After connecting to the
    OrBit BBS you can post a message to our support staff describing
    your question or problem.  A member of the OrBit Software support
    staff will read and respond to your message within 48 hours
    (average response time is 24 hours).  Complete instructions for
    posting such a message are provided on-line.

    Since the response to your question will be posted to the BBS, we
    suggest that you call back in 24-48 hours.  After logging on, the
    system will notify you if there is a response waiting for you to
    read.

    If you do not have access to a modem, technical support is also
    available via the US Mail.  Write us a letter describing your
    question or problem and send it to OrBit software.  Your letter
    will be answered in a timely manner by a member of the OrBit
    technical support staff.  When writing to us for technical
    support, please include your registration number, a description of
    your system (including video card), and as much information as
    possible about your question or problem.

13. AUTHOR'S COMMENTS
    =================

    I would like to take a moment to explain why I created the OrBit
    Editor and why I think it is unique.

    My inspiration for creating this editor was a direct result of my
    dissatisfaction with the binary editors currently available.  For
    my own personal use, I needed a binary file editor that was easy
    to use, loaded extremely fast, supported 50 line mode, and allowed
    editing in decimal mode.  There was not an editor available that
    provided all of these features.

    I found that most of the binary editors that were commercially
    available supported editing at the sector and physical level in
    addition to the file level.  These editors were made for advanced
    users who understand these features and can safely use them.  When
    loading, some of these editors spent a significant amount of time
    examining the file system and directory structure before allowing
    the user to begin editing.

                               Page 19

OrBit Editor (TM) Version 1.0            Copyright 1993 OrBit Software


    The user who simply needs to binary edit a file should not be
    exposed to the complexities of sector level editing or be required
    to wait while the editor examines the file system.

    The OrBit Editor is my solution to these problems.  The editor
    loads extremely fast (less than 3 seconds on most systems) and
    clearly displays the options available to the user.  Since the
    editor only interacts at the file level there is no possibility
    that the user is going to accidently damage the file system.

    To ensure the editor was small and fast, I coded it in assembly
    language.  The editor's executable file is very small (34K) and
    memory requirements are at a minimum.  The speed of the editor's
    searching and scrolling exceeds that of most editors.  Support
    personnel who carry a disk containing the "essentials" will be
    pleased with the small file size and the fact it is self contained
    within the single executable file.

14. DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE
    =======================

    Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before
    buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue using it,
    you are expected to register. Individual programs differ on
    details -- some request registration while others require it, some
    specify a maximum trial period. With registration, you get
    anything from the simple right to continue using the software to
    an updated program with printed manual.

    Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software,
    and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
    exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are accomplished
    programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs are of
    comparable quality. (In both cases, there are good programs and
    bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of distribution.
    The author specifically grants the right to copy and distribute
    the software, either to all and sundry or to a specific group. For
    example, some authors require written permission before a
    commercial disk vendor may copy their Shareware.

    Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You
    should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether
    it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes fitting
    your needs easier, because you can try before you buy. And because
    the overhead is low, prices are low also. Shareware has the
    ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the product, you
    don't pay for it.

    This program is produced by a member of the Association of
    Shareware Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the
    shareware principle works for you.  If you are unable to resolve a

    member directly, ASP may be able to help.  The ASP Ombudsman can
    help you resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but does
    not provide technical support for member products. Please write to
