  start FreeData ramifications blog to doc ideas about facets of potential
    future of free (&& anonymous?) copying of any data... 
    think/write about inevitibility of free &&/|| anon copying
    mk QbixRube of:
      Certain,   Likely,   Possible
      Benefits,  Neutral,  Harm
      Immediate, Mid Term, Lasting
    where Mid Term is right after shock of revolution stabilizes but it may
      be identical to Lasting
    maybe also add groups affected (eg. oppressed underground, musicians, etc.)
    The purpose is to explore whether it is likely that the immediate harm 
      (including immense disruption of many large industries) alone would not
      be worth the sum of all the benefits.  I have imagined the benefits are
      worth it but I'm not sure why I should be confident in the value of an
      uncertain future... so I must consider it further.
    If some sort of conclusion can be reasonably established (I wish I hadn't
      already assumed what I'm trying to prove but hopefully through the 
      process of my search, I will be willing to accept a different belief if
      it makes sense), such a conclusion might warrant an extreme reaction
      (eg. boycott any supporter of DRM or boycott non-DRM because it should 
      be universal) to the moderate course I am already on of discussing the 
      issues when possible but still purchasing products, seeing movies, etc.
      when I can afford it && feel like it.
