1993 Ford MustangLX (2-door manual 5-speed) VIN:1FACP41M0PF189991 Color:Black License:3KTG983
  61QLPEn - To the best of my recollection: The car was sold to Meghan Michelle Watkins 316 S. 5th St. Richmond CA, 94804 on Date:571, for Price:$1000.
    Meghan's CA Driver's License#: D4273784  She claimed the car was a gift on the title when it changed hands on Date:576.
    Odometer at transfer:134,214
    I am now filling out the DMV 'Notice of Transfer and Release of Liability' form and am claiming the car was sold on Date:561 for Price:$1 (because she owes
    me over $1000 for Nitemare repairs and the DMV does not deserve to know any of my financial information [nor does any Gov't agency]).
    Unfortunately, I cannot submit this form without the VIN, Mileage, and Meghan's address.
  627FHlr - I am sending affidavits of non-liability in response to the fourth violation notice I have received.
