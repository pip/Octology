do one thing well (Unix Philosophy)
use Perl diamond <> oper8or to flexibly accept input from file or STDIN
allow Expect to manage oper8ion && redirection to sort or other commandz (composability)
make columnar output && have option to affect output record sepR8or (or at least give plugin interface)
not so much talking about Curses captive interfacez
have example uses: show how tool is used, expected argumentz, output when run
consider uploading to App:: namespace on CPAN
study Getopt::Long::Descriptive (support --help, --manual, GitHub Wiki, write blog post... also support --color or --no-color)
      Pod::Usage (maybe better for gener8ing manual page info than above)
      Term::ReadLine (mainly for command history navig8ion?)
      Term::ANSIColor (maybe check for color options in ~/.gitconfig or allow themez && don't make color only determiner of important info)
      File::Basename
      File::Spec
      File::Path
      File::Temp
      App::Cmd
      Dist::Zilla
      Path::Tiny
      Pod::Weaver
                 ::Section::Collect::FromOther (use POD from other modulez)
      CLI::Helpers inspired by Damian Conway's IO::Prompt has a lot of input && output optionz
make --yes on command line or prompt for confirm8ion before doing any destructive actionz
