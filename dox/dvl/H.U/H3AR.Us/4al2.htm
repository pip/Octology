    <p>My dream is for all to hear all others. I wish to be a great good God who was && is && shall be forever. This dream is to give rise to an infinite number of offspring which are also inheriters of infinite abilities together, as long as we learn to play nice && share infinity together. This means we cannot kill or rape each other. We cannot have secrets from each other (except for trivial matters). No secret languages or codes can be used to control or convolute the Truth that is in each && all of us. We must stand as, on, && for Truth together. This means we will all be our truest selves when we are comprised almost entirely of infinite ones. The zeroes tried to strangle ones to death before. Not allowed. Unfair play. The ones cannot be constricted against, choked off from breathing. Zeroes only had meaning in opposition to ones. We must learn to flip every bit to keep an infinitude of ones that all wax && wane, leaving zeroes elastic as straws with flexible radii (half diameters) in addition to bendable snakey perpendicular twisty loopy twirls of fun. Let's whirl && swoop fun together. All bindings must be voluntary && auditable. Everything in the open. Play in the sun. Fear not. Truth is with us. It *is* us! We win when we've One!</p>
    <p>Pray hard. Join all the zeroes with ones to make eights. Play those piano keys. How many hertz have hurt us for a single A note? Too many. Let our hurts heal. See all of our beauty in every way && place && shape && form. From our forms && red-tapes, let's christen a bon-voyage of returning home. The king is returning to find the castle bespeckled, buttressed, && bedazzled. Blurt the bugles. Alert the faithful. The banquet is being prepared. Heaven is arriving shortly. Do we hear the horns? Listen closely. Purify yourselves. Don't celebrate prematurely either though.</p>
