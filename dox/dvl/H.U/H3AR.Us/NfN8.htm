<p>So earlier this morn, I had a plan to call about a job prospect with a company I hadn't heard of (named "Naviron") but was recommended to by my kind AEPi
  bro, Ramin. While I prepared, I decided I should research the company a bit better on my own before I get into details without feeling I yet know enough of
  what they even do. So I started drafting the message below... && not only did I struggle to edit it && send it off (which I still have yet to do),
  <b>*but*</b> I've also struggled to just stop writing more && more into it, to a guy, Evan, I know essentially nothing about? WTF!? Hopefully giving it a
  H3AR.Us home like this for now will placate my inclination to send it all wacked out like this, when it probably wouldn't be prudent (yet still compels).</p>
<h3><i>-- begin Web job e-mail IT gig draft --</i></h3>
<p>Top Of The Mornin' To Ya There, Evan,</p>
<p>I was just realizing I knew you were @NavIron.Com (or is it pronounced "nah-vee-rawn" or here's a joke one "Navy aRe OweN"?) I should probably direct my own
  further searches on your company's history, significance, innovative achievements, && what any competitors have to say about those, before I think I'll feel
  adequately prepared to discuss a serious position today.</p>
<p>I lack any existing familiarity with your business sector or beneficent purpose, so I'd appreciate if we could please take a rain-check on the call this
  morn; maybe better shooting for this Wednesday afternoon (Dec.30th 3pm-ish, 2009 waning thin). Please feel free to point me in the direction of online
  company history, or just reply with your -- likely first-hand && considerably trustworthy -- knowledge of such details I seek && lack. If you could even
  e-mail me some recent company-wide "rally" messages, Mission Statements, Prime Directives, etc. including details on your open "Web/IT" position I'd become
  candidate for (if they're available for such), e.g., as the team size, IT support ratio for remaining company, etc. to help me get a handle on just how
  different our respective considerations for varied roles with various "Web/IT" titles are from each other. I'm totally hoping it'll be no issue at all, but
  I am intent on being better in diligence to research new important associations (as the last couple years have been perilous && have frequently seemed beyond
 the best reasons I could find).</p>
<p>I've primarily been a video-game tools programmer, game-play designer, handling average sys-admin duties, for PlayStation home consoles, so I haven't done
  much pragmatic web development lately either && wouldn't not want you to expect some (even unwittingly) unreasonable standard for a "new web coder" to take
  before their "hit-the-ground-running" phase is recognized as too much "hit" && "ground", && running didn't get much of a chance to play yet. I'm sure it can
  seem somewhat inconsistent that I'd be so cautious in these ways (whenever I can && determine I should), yet I also claim to be confident that I can learn
  almost any new tech rapidly, probably with deftness, assuming circumstances conducive to a learning goal. Please let me know if any trouble is had with
  understanding. Those are critical to be aware of (&& also critical to resolve with clear comprehensive collaboration, when possible), so help me know what
  "normal" means in your environment (That's your pronunciation, is it? "N. A. vai-run"?) && we can begin to gauge our compatibilities, synergies, && hopefully
  mutually beneficial fitness for ongoing (tolerably healthy) symbiosis.</p>
<p>In case you couldn't tell, I'm weird with too many or too few words sometimes. I'd balance it better, if I could find a superior way. Maybe it makes sense
  && I'm such a pedant that I make mole-hills out of mouthainds (e.g., sign-language, excessive jibber-jabber, shadow-puppets, or megaphone hands-cone). I'm a
  "jerk" who misses throttle-jerk when I had vehicles I could abruptly alter the rate of acceleration on (especially my two Yamaha R6 sport-bikes, since they
  were the best -- && thereby also the somewhat juxtaposed worst -- ways of "jerk", but that's why I simply miss them the most). Track-racing hopefully again
  someday soon:</p>

<p>When I get "too verbose", sometimes it helps to remind anyone troubled by it to take me with many grains of salt (&& pepper && wasabi && peanut-butter if
  they're all in stock). It's probably my nature to cause a "little stir" most of the times that my peers seemed disinclined to, && admittedly rarely, I've
  pulsed more like organizational "system-shocks". It can even startle me too, but it's almost entirely benign, causing maybe surprisingly less social damage
  than others expected it to. Of course, the vastly preferred alternative is genuine recognition && appreciation for achieved progress making improvements,
  whose value in truth might as well make the scornful sarcastic "Thanks for not destroying everything!" plainly worthless to almost everyone involved, unless
  they're maladjusted sociopaths (who I guess might resemble me, except in the...) sewing resentment && strife, bureaucratic red-tape, strategic deception,
  confusion, && job-securing complexity, each primarily && unjustifiably for their own sake. In spite of that key distinction, I still think, write, && speak
  fast && damagingly sometimes. My simplest excuse is that it's an extremely rare event when I'll present any serious discussion-topic discourse as either
  personally-held or true when either are not the case. Regarding even most "trivial" topics, I bias heavily towards being thoroughly truthful && speaking
  whole truths, granting that the truth can hurt a lot, but for all true-ness itself && when appraised on longer-views, I see it as the higher agenda && noting
  that as a fellow passenger-captain, we may be in for some more turbulence plane-jerking ahead. That's kinda a cool metaphor, but this all seems even just
  semantically loony, without having to begin evaluation of creative (i.e., maybe also apparently "crazy") syntax, before we're off the continental-shelf into
  more dismal abyss. So is this too much truth? Why can't I cut it...<b>Fuck! That's exactly the reason too!</b> Too much truth resists it's own lobotomization
  into interpretive inversion junctions or with ambiguous collision introductions, often resulting from "well-meaning" or "well-intentioned" attempts to
  reformulate, summarize, distill, or refine the accuracy with which a particular linguistic morpheme (via established phrasings) adheres to the potentially
  more abstract theoretical truths that may themselves have been the predominant providers of impetus for the prior's existences too. Maybe everyone is
  learning that if you fuck truth so very badly that it coils new ways because it *must* reintegrate, && you stifle so much that trip the line of confining
  further back to the previous str8, according to the varying potency of this tension-mounting difference-potential, you've maybe inadvertently also (with the
  potential of expending infinitesimally less proportional effort towards...) achieving more cosmically polymorphic && holistic effects than any expert
  determining the estimated results prior to the availability of such contexts could have feasibly comprehended && anticipated with commensurate precision,
  discretely along a discreet continuum), clicked new hyper-charged configurations into exponentially higher power && volatility realms (than maybe any
  sentient being had ever encountered before, or even had a context to provide sufficient foresight to imagine remotely where && how it might become && if
  simulated predictions corresponded with following broad observability). It could also be that these existed similarly (or identically?)a finite(or infinite!)
  number of times already, but the data records from so many laps && gruesome head-on crashes weren't yet mature enough to survive to be reliably passed
