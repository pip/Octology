    <p>I composed most of the following project descriptions on Friday, August 29th of 2008 in hopes of earning a FaceBook developer grant but I wasn't
      able to put the required business-plan details into a 2-3 minute video by that submission deadline. I'd still greatly appreciate funding for my
      projects since I believe they'd still be immensely beneficial to all of humanity (here, almost a year later on Monday, August 17th of 2009) and
      I'd love a chance to prove it.</p>
    <p>Bavl (pronounced "bah-vell", as in the Hebrew form for the Tower of "Babel") is a Free (GPLv3) web application for collaboratively learning how
      to comprehend and speak foreign languages (a demographic occupied primarily by college students). Bavl is designed to present columnar web pages
      of words, phrases, and lessons in a learner's familiar or fluent language being vertically aligned with their sought after literal or figurative
      (and contextually aware) translations. Such texts additionally provide hyperlinks for recording, or listening to any existing, vocalizations by
      native (or otherwise fluent) speaking contributors.</p>
    <p>Bavl potentially has great synergy with FaceBook, which is why a simplified FaceBook-Application version serves to extend the utility of each
      respective community in mutually beneficial ways. Astonished Bavlianz will celebrate their invaluable new ability to finally <b>*hear*</b> each
      complex word's enunciation which has been rated most accurate. Previously devastating errors in international, intercultural, and interpersonal
      communication, translation, and pronunciation will progressively become globally antiquated relics marveled about in virtual museums; their tales
      standing as monuments and memorials for the dark days of communicative confusion which clouded and choked so many past efforts to achieve
      worldwide conscious collaborative peace. FaceBook can be the first tome inducted into the Towr.of.Bavl, inaugurating the utilitarian effort to
      provide free language learning materials for our world, as well as any other planets Earthlings may someday discover and inhabit.</p>
    <h4>Application Information section:</h4>
    <p>Bavl aims to Towr over competing language-learning systems by being first free for anyone to use and second sagely simple. Bavl's FaceBook
      application will begin as BavlCard: an extensively customizable flash/playing card creator which supports collecting, trading, and building
      custom decks. Random quizzes can be run for any user's flash-card deck and long-term results will be recorded enabling progress tallying,
      projected goal plotting, and dynamic difficulty scaling. BavlCard will grow to support interactive cooperative and competitive quizzes for
      flash-card decks as well as user-created playing-card games (e.g., Solitaire, Poker, BlackJack, Bridge, etc.). Of course Bavl intends to utilize
      BavlCard heavily for language-learning purposes such as free automatically generated vocabulary word flash-card decks, as well as iconic faces
      which may prompt students to enter the correct spelling of the foreign word hidden on the card's back which the icon corresponds to or they may
      be asked to enter the correct familiar translated word to match the card's back after hearing a native speaker pronounce a foreign word as the
      front of the card displays a foreign spelling, a representative image, or both. We'd also eventually intend for card faces to display user's
      animations and videos with equal aplomb.</p>
    <p>BavlCard is intended to be a compelling FreeSoftware (<a href="HTTP://FSF.Org">HTTP://FSF.Org</a>) gift to all the members of Bavl.Org's site,
      those of FaceBook, and anyone else who opts to obtain the GPLv3-licensed source-code from which to create their own decks, cases, or
      incorporated into their own GPLv3-licensed FreeSoftware application.</p>
    <p>After BavlCard has matured, we intend to explore the best methods for slimming down some of Bavl.Org's core listening, translation, and
      lesson-creation features into an entertaining, instructional, and again extensively customizable additional FaceBook application called BavlBook.</p>
    <p>Bavl's road-map extends into the stratosphere via a supplemental infinitely-customizable universally-applicable FreeSoftware
      Reputation/ranking/rating system which can be applied to arbitrary and spontaneous non-exclusive categories (think "tags" or "labels" instead of
      a tree of folders/directories) and where each valuation can encompass precision-levels bounded only by the computing platform's CPU and memory
      capacities. For example, the default system may provide the popular ternary ratings of neutral, thumb-up, or thumb-down (which could employ
      Credence-like anonymous propagation), another trend-setting option would be the five-star iconic scheme (popular in NetFlix, iTunes, etc.),
      another employing an integer scale between one (1) and ten (10), integers zero (0) to one hundred (100) as percentages, or even fixed or
      double-precision floating-point values likely scaled or clamped within -1.0 and 1.0. Users could perform extensive manipulations to their
      personal rating spectrum for any category they've defined, like extension/truncation, sliding/shifting, scaling/compressing, curving,
      distributing, etc. with arbitrary precision (i.e., ranges would not need to be constrained by the local-machine's 32 or 64-bit processor's
      limitations, although such immense flexibility might be worth discouraging somewhat since it would likely introduce dramatic performance issues
      during deeply involved ranking computations). Algorithmic transformations would be used in every instance possible to have each encountered rating
      or ranking correspond and display according to any particular user's idiosyncratic behavioral and visual preferences.</p>
    <p>Refactoring Bavl to support decentralized P2P swarming ad-hoc (optionally IPv6 with MultiCast) networks would facilitate adoption and usage of
      private (maybe even secretive, underground) Bavl societies within critically inhospitable communities. This move would enable more dynamic latency
      and bandwidth tuning options to become available for particular purposes. Thorough integration with RepU accompanied by utilities and expressive
      interfaces for constructing and maintaining social-network graphs would have tremendous potential to morph into a large, diverse, encrypted
      trust-net or reputation-based economy. This could eventually encompass inferior context-centric rating/ranking/currency systems that are too
      limited and tightly-coupled to be useful on a broader scale. RepU could supplant the moderation/quality-rating systems for: SlashDot, NetFlix,
      PayPal, EBay, Amazon, social-nets, forums, wikis, blogs, videos, games, comics, images, pages, authors, etc. all in a user-controlled way,
      independent of remote web-servers and their lack of high-precision options, where backups can be preserved along the most trusted vectors of the
      network that have donated or designated local disk space to be exchanged for such remote backup purposes.</p>
    <p>Everyone and everything could be rated and ranked by anyone who cares to, and those results could be aggregated, propagated, and automatically
      inherited by others who trust the discernment of the first group, deferring valuation to those who know the domain better. Individuals could
      control as many facets of the interface, logic, storage, mirroring, etc. as they care to, regarding every data-category, tag, label, group, set,
      etc. they've defined (or, again, inherited). Nobody would need to continually risk losing their historical profiles, contacts, posts, pictures,
      achievements, or communal reputation by trusting Friendster, FaceBook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Flickr, etc. to stay in business, keep their servers
      online, or preserve their original data-formatting and accessibility... since explicit trust would be easier to specify, as would the initiation
      of automated redundant diversified data-preservation activities to archive complete revision-histories in accordance with such trust.</p>
    <p>It bears mentioning that any user should be able to create as many new facets as they desire for any identifiable thing, rating on that facet
      however they prefer, and incorporating any contribution in custom ways too.</p>
    <p>The road-map continues climbing into universally descriptive (yet still completely personally customizable) event models, powerfully navigable
      time-lines (rewind/roll-back to any historical point from which to explore an arbitrarily divergent branch of interaction), interactive education,
      editors/authoring tools, cross-platform cross-genre game engines and development frameworks, personal input device configurations, stereoscopic
      head-mounted displays, quantum-computers, and warp-drives. ;) </p>
    <p>Just say if you'd like to see more cross-streets, sign-posts, or other features for this road-map.</p>
    <p>Here's a link to cool 4D visualization videos that can help explain some of the mathematical aspects behind this kind of thinking:
