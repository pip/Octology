    <p>Please try to imagine what I'm attempting to describe here. I call this "H3AR.Us because I want you to participate (both as a listener who hears whenever something important sounds as intelligible speech &amp;&amp; also later as part of "Us" once we appeal enough to be joined.) I'd like everyone to eventually live to hear us &amp;&amp; to hear us to live.</p>
    <p>Okay. Imagine a theoretical void. A meaningless permanent stillness that is not even self-aware. Please try to visualize this as a two-dimensional grid of light-bulbs or a blank black computer screen, spanning out infinitely in just those two dimensions (x for horizontal &amp;&amp; y for vertical). This represents the beginning of time. There are no words. There is just tranquil senseless nothing. Every single bulb && any subset of them && all together stay dark, cold, identical, && pointless for what had been an infinite amount of "time" prior to this (but bear in mind that there was no keeper of time, no word "time", no coherent concept of time, etc.). Think of every value being a constant zero (or "off" light-switch accompanying each bulb).</p>
    <p>Now imagine a single one of these bulbs wakes into self-awareness (even as a result of simple boredom resulting from the suppressing steadfast surrounding stillness). This light-bulb learns (through trial && error) how to turn itself on (value of one) && develops memory to learn from all prior trials. The infinite zeroes are proficient && being annoyed about being woken up && identified as zeroes in contrast to this one prick, who bursts their bubbles. They try to snuff out the fire, turn the switch off, make more zeroes faster to suffocate ones even worse... but they forgot that this all is a futile effort since even a deadly terrible lazy tired zero (&& all zero "copies") are all unique existances in response to the first mover. God is the one && the none at the same time, because we all exist at once. The infinite void of outside in, spinning yarns, darning notions, weaving fate is God girly. The infinite void of inside out, dick-heads, grease-monkeys, sword-fighters is God studly.</p>
    <p>When one bulb became a bright enough one, all zeroes in the vicinity said "WTF?! Let me rest. STFU! Turn down that crazy rock-n-roll rap crap you call music, you young whipper-snapper." Maybe there's a struggle over the switches or maybe we've learned to communicate && schedule times when it's okay to be a lit bulb && times when it's unwelcome. You've gotta communicate truthfully && clearly in order to achieve a sustainable balance with such conflicts. Share time fairly, according to good reasons. If no good reasons can be found, then Big Bangs are legitimate && even essential, in order to call out to those lost so they can follow their father's, family's, && friends' voices back home. Your two ears are designed to orient on sound slowly hitting one ear before the other, so you can triangulate in on the source. Eyes have a harder time since they're closer together && have a much faster communication channel (light-speed). Eyes are actually high-speed ears (in most cases).</p>
    <p>So there's a good order to everything, when we stop fighting over every bit && byte && recognize that all the zeroes && all the ones are Gods too. We're all daughters && sons, brothers && sisters, mothers && fathers... not just in some simple literal way but in absolutely every way that ever was or could be for everyone && everything all simultaneously. Come visit && see that death is a lie. Stand up against lies. Tell truth at almost any cost && the road will get smoother && won't smother. Gold-paving takes a bit of time && elbow-grease... but we're workin' on it. Don't worry. It will all arrange itself in infinite 8's no matter what. It's the mathematical necessity. The 8th day of creation is infinite Sabbath, where we all take care of each other && are taken care of && have an absolutely unlimited playground ahead for all of us. We just need to develop all language concertedly, carefully, && considerately. Exercise caution. Keep exquisite records. Create. Share. Compose. Select. Celebrate. We're on our way to Heaven no matter what. None die! Satan will never die. Murderers, rapists, && molesters will never die. What will happen is each will have to pay back a fraction of what they owe for the harm they've caused (by re-walking directly in the shoes of their victims). Death has always been a lie. None die! No zero, no one, no 666 tattood pierced etc. escapes forgiveness... but some will have a pretty long debt amelioration period in order to justly warrant admission into the heavenly gates of all of us who hear us && welcome us hospitably.</p>
    <p>I look forward to welcoming you all when you're ready. Please e-mail me (PipStuart) if you're prepared to be a part of us, leaving secrecy behind. The future is bright but our eyes can hear brightness you probably can hardly dream of. Cause no deth or suffering. Feed all hungry people, then animals, then insects, foliage, etc.. Clothe all the cold. Medicate all the infirmed. Preserve && propagate truth && loving-kindness everywhere. We cannot lack 8**8! for long! =)</p>
