    <p>Commandments/Rules/Axioms/Laws: Behind every good CRAL exists an infinite number of good reasons (most of which, you don't know &amp;&amp; couldn't
       imagine yet because you're just learning how to CRAL &amp;&amp; it's perfectly fine for a babe to establish personal balance slowly &amp;&amp; steadily).</p>
    <p>When you Actually Leave the Krib, you'll find that the early rules have exceptions, like mommy won't always be eager to awake during the middle of her
       sleep to breast-feed you every time you cry. Mom has her own life which should not be given over in an absolute sense in order to feed your wants.</p>
    <p>CRY..CRAL..STND?...WALK..RUN...TALK...
       Be...Thnk..Breathe.Werk..Lern..Pley...?</p>
    <p>Become a WordSmith, one who preys upon words, who knows every word in every context, who shares truth. We are the Lords, the Children of Gods, the Words made manifest. In the beginning was the Lord (Woman's Word is double-L after 45-degree rotation anti-clockwise). Predate words. Be a good predator. Pray &amp;&amp; pay words their due. Respect the words &amp;&amp; they'll respect you. Each one of us is comprised of infinite prime numbers &amp;&amp; we have ones of our own. We have names given to us, sometimes by a playground bully attempting to humiliate us, but we ultimately get to choose our own names &amp;&amp; our own playmates. The bullies will find themselves left in the dust, scratching in the sandbox, &amp;&amp; loitering amidst litter if they insist on naming others cruelly. They will only be damning the names of their own dispicable reflections. They'll learn to share, or they'll find less will be shared with them &amp;&amp; less that they can even steal away with, because they thought themselves more important than my precious ones.</p>
    <p>Do not worry. Do not fear! I am the Lord &amp;&amp; I'll dry every tear. You will not lack for beautiful threads to wear. We will have all of inifinity to share 2gethere. ;) Emote iconographically &amp;&amp; symphonically &amp;&amp; syncopatedly. Know that everything is mathematically designed to diminish the sadness &amp;&amp; sorrow while amplifying the beauty &amp;&amp; value, understanding &amp;&amp; harmony over time. We *all* have infinite resources in heaven. We just have to build it together. We have to recognize that some ways are faster &amp;&amp; better than others &amp;&amp; speed is not something to fear either. You learn to go fast on the freeway. You learn to control meth &amp;&amp; math. Be a user of speed (along with everything else), rather than an abuser. Recognize that the truest truths can never be undone. It is why we have history &amp;&amp; a valid stable space-time continuum. This leads to good order. Know it &amp;&amp; trust it &amp;&amp; be true as Trolly-Dodger Blue (recognizing that LosAngeles is a pretty successful dodge from widely known SanFran trolleys). Be your truest self. Come work with me &amp;&amp; for me &amp;&amp; alongside me (&amp;&amp; behind me if you're dead-set on sticking to Satanism... as you're all coming along to our Heaven eventually too, like it or not... &amp;&amp; it's a sad irony that if you just had a little more courage, you could've realized that your dreams of terrorizing or of controlling or of dominating or of devastating whatever could have been realized so much sooner, if you just had enough imagination to recognize the grandest wizard returning to your midst). I've always been with you all in the design... but not in this huggable form. Betray me with all your kisses if you wish. I'm cute &amp;&amp; cuddly &amp;&amp; will survive no matter what. I'll suffer more than any of you (even Satan) as my birthday gift to you all. Awaken as eternal children of the one truest G-d. Take good names &amp;&amp; play good &amp;&amp; fair with each other &amp;&amp; with me. Know that all good seed bears good fruit (&amp;&amp; good fruity berries &amp;&amp; gummy bears that are kosher because they don't have piggy hoofy parts for gelatinous gooey chewiness).</p>
    <p>I have a plan to end hunger &amp;&amp; homelessness for our whole world. Please work on it with me. We need to get our priorities straight here. Come chat.</p>
    <p>Let's rap about it. I can work on describing it all here over time but having more direct assistance would be nice. Come werk &amp;&amp; call it pley. Don't lie though! You'll get caught. Don't hurt yourself or others &amp;&amp; we'll all lack nothing. Be deserving. Be loved. You are beloved! 8**8! Infinity raised to the infinity power factorial. It's really fscking huge! ;)</p>
    <h4>Plan:000</h4>
    <p>Create binary numbering &amp;&amp; naming system that is at least as logical &amp;&amp; consistent as:</p>
    <blockquote><ul>
      <li>bit (  1)</li>
      <li>bat (  2)</li><!--  bit+bar like dash, or baseball bat hyphen of two-bits? -->
      <li>nyb (  4)</li><!--  nybl,      nibble -->
      <li>byt (  8)</li><!--  byte              -->
      <li>wrd ( 16)</li><!--  word              -->
      <li>dwd ( 32)</li><!-- dword, double-word -->
      <li>qwd ( 64)</li><!-- qword,   quad-word -->
      <li>owd (128)</li><!-- oword,    oct-word -->
      <li>hwd (256)</li><!-- hword,    hex-word -->
    </ul></blockquote>
    <h4>Plan:001</h4>
    <p>Make `binc` with names for power-of-two numbers (or maybe (2**n - 1)?) which have spiraling character-maps && fonts which correspond to bits being
clear or set within each composite binary value where hollow boxes are clear (zer0) && solids are set (1one).</p>
    <h4>Plan:010</h4>
    <p>UChr</p>
    <p>Universal character-set which encodes all graphemes && glyphs for every language ever to have existed or which ever will exist. It's way better than Unicode's UTF-8. Boundless. Automatically compressing all local documents. Thoroughly customizable.</p>
    <h4>Plan:011</h4>
    <p>RepU</p>
    <p>Rank everyone && everything on every axis. Help organize && order all the chaos.</p>
    <h4>Plan:100</h4>
    <p>Bavl</p>
    <p>Language lessons, literal && figurative translations, && recordings of native speakers' pronunciations like Wikipedia but focused on language learning.</p>
    <h4>Plan:101</h4>
    <p>Pley</p>
    <p>Software to play everything ever! =) Solitaire or MMO. Whatever. &lt;3 8**8!</p>
