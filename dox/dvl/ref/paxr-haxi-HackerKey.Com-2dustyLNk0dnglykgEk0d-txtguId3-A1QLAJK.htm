<h3><a name="aboutguide"></a>About the Hacker Key Guide<br>
</h3>
The Hacker Key Guide was inspired by Robert Hayden's excellent <a
 href="http://www.geekcode.com">Geek Code</a>
which has been a long time hacker favorite.&nbsp; However, the Geek
Code has not been updated in a long time, and although the
commercialization of the Internet has washed away much of the old
hacker environment (MUDs, BBSes, DOS...), we must attempt to keep
hacker traditions alive, by reimplementation if needed.<br>
<br>
Let's look at a sample Geek Code Block:<br>
<br>
-----BEGIN GEEK CODE BLOCK-----<br>
Version: 3.12<br>
GCS d- s+: a- C++ US++++ P++ L+++ E--- W++ N+ o K- w--<br>
O+ M+ V PS++ PE- Y PGP+ t+ 5 X R tv+ b+ DI+ D+<br>
G++ e++ h--- r+++ y+<br>
------END GEEK CODE BLOCK------<br>
<br>
<a name="geekcodepluses"></a>The Geek Code does many things well:<br>
<ul>
  <li>It's VERY geeky.&nbsp; Short text strings with + or - delimeters
to show relative positions on an issue.<br>
  </li>
  <li>It's unique.&nbsp; It's very easy to identify the geek code and
it has been picked up by other groups looking for ways to identify
themselves, showing its versatility.</li>
  <li>It's very simple to determine which things a person is very
passionate about.&nbsp; In the above example, a quick glance shows the
person seems to be a married, liberal, Unix loving geek who doesn't
care for TV shows all that much.</li>
</ul>
<a name="geekcodeminuses"></a>However, there are also some problems
with the GeekCode:<br>
<ul>
  <li>First and foremost, there is a lot of wasted space.&nbsp; While
it makes it very easy to determine a person is a master of something
with 5 plus signs, it's plain wasteful.&nbsp; The primary (and most
logical) place to display one's geek code is in one's signature
file.&nbsp; Even today, netiquette still favors short signature files,
and the average Geek Code is 6 lines all by itself.&nbsp; Geeks tend to
follow netiquette when possible, so this leads to the very people
targeted by the Geek Code not promoting it in their sigs!<br>
  </li>
  <li>The code is designed to resemble a PGP key block, but includes
characters that are not valid in a PGP key, in particular, the minus
(-) symbol and parentheses () are very commonly used.&nbsp; Valid
characters in a PGP key are [A-Za-z0-9], plus (+) and slash (/). There
are no spaces in a normal key either.<br>
  </li>
  <li>It's not cryptic enough ;-)&nbsp; This is jest, but it's almost
TOO easy for one to determine a person's Geek Code at a glance,
which sort of takes the secret-decoder-ring-type fun out of things.</li>
  <li>The aforementioned problem with the Geek Code being out of
date.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<a name="designgoals"></a>The Hacker Key Guide hopes to keep the good
aspects of the Geek Code and improve on some of the bad ones.<br>
Design goals for the Hacker Key Guide are:<br>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>A normal key with a few extra category choices should fit on one
80
column line of text.&nbsp; Ideally, it should fit with enough room for
the Hacker Key URL to fit on the same line, to give people some shot at
figuring out what the
heck it is.</li>
  <li><a name="goalno2"></a>Ensure that the most commonly used symbols
are valid PGP key
symbols also.&nbsp; For compatibility with the Geek Code we will use
more symbols which aren't valid, but will make sure the most commonly
used ones are.</li>
  <li>Keep the Guide up to date.&nbsp; I can only promise I will either
keep the guide up to date or turn it over to someone who
will.&nbsp;&nbsp; Time will tell if I can keep that promise.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="format"></a>Format of a Hacker Key Entry<br>
</h3>
A Hacker Key is constructed as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The category in question will be listed in all lower case (e.g. u
is for Unix).</li>
  <li>The number corresponding to your answer to the category (e.g.
7).&nbsp; Rather than plus or minuses, a median score of 5 is assigned
for each category.&nbsp; Extremely positive answers are higher than 5
(the normal maximum is 9), negative answers are lower then 5 (the
normal minimum being 0).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Optional cagetory choices should be at the end, and should be in
all upper case (e.g. SL for Solaris, Linux).</li>
  <li>When proceeding to the next section, <B>do not skip a space!</B><br>
  </li>
</ul>
So for our example, the Unix category would be filled out as: u7SL<br>
<h3><a name="modifiers"></a>Modifiers</h3>
The most commonly used Geek Code "variables" seem to be "ranges" (@ and
()) and "wannabe"&nbsp; (&gt;).&nbsp; To follow <a href="#goalno2">Design
Goal #2</a>, the
following changes have been made for the Hackey Key:<br>
<ul>
  <li>/ - To indicate a "range" answer, use the slash (/) key in your
answer.&nbsp; For the (@) freely ranging option, use a / at the end of
your numerical answer, e.g. u5/.&nbsp; To indicate a specific range in
your answer, use the slash between your two answers, e.g. u5/7.</li>
  <li>+ - To indicate your "wannabe" rating, use the plus (+)
symbol.&nbsp; Yes it looks odd and (&gt;) is a more intuitive
character, but to not use a valid PGP key
character when it is one of only two available non-alphanumeric
characters would
be a travesty.&nbsp; For example, if you kind of like Unix but wished
you were a guru, you would use u5+8.</li>
</ul>
The remainder of the symbols are compatible with the Geek
Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are listed for compatibility with the Geek
Code, though they are very much optional and are invalid characters in
a PGP key anyway.&nbsp; For completeness here they are:
<ul>
  <li>$ - To indicate you do a certain type of hacking of related
activity for a living, add a $ at the end, e.g. u9$</li>
  <li>? - State that you don't know anything about this
category.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is the case however, why are you creating
a Hacker Key?</li>
  <li>! - Staunch refusal to participate in the category.&nbsp; This
should normally accomplished with a 0 for a category, so it really
should not be used.&nbsp; In order to be consistent with the Geek Code,
if you DO decide to use this character, please put it ONLY at the
begining of a category and obviously do not enter a number value.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

G - I use Windows machines but only with Cygwin installed


m - MacOS (X).  Let's face it kiddies, OS 9 is dead.

9 - I am Steve Jobs.
8 - I've written books about programming with Cocoa and Carbon.  See you 
    at the WWDC!
7 - I love it!  The power of Unix and a slick aqua GUI are the 
    height of computing. I've written the occasional app or two.
6 - I like the new MacOS.  Finally stability AND ease of use!
5 - MacOS X is okay.  A nice GUI front-end for a Unix OS.
4 - I don't like it.  There's not enough emphasis on the CLI.
3 - I hate it.  The GUI takes up half my RAM and it still locks up on me 
    even though it's UNIX based!
2 - I despise MacOS X.  I miss "Classic" MacOS (<= 9).
1 - I despise MacOS X.  I miss the Apple ][.


l - Linux.  The free OS that changed computing.  For GNU/Free Software 
    folk, use g/l (GNU/Linux) instead.

9 - I am Linus Torvalds or Alan Cox.
8 - I am an active kernel hacker/package maintainer.  If Linux didn't 
    exist, I might have to leave my house once in a while!
7 - I'm a power user.  I've developed my own mini-distribution on a 
    whim.  I can't count how many kernels I've compiled.
6 - I really like Linux.  I've tried a few distributions and am almost 
    decided on one.  Windows sucks.
5 - Linux is okay.  
4 - I don't like Linux.  It still relies too much on the command line.
3 - I hate Linux.  It's not really UNIX, it's a cheap knock off.  This 
    whole open sores thing will never work!
2 - I despise Linux and its commie supporters.  Thank God there's a 
    great company like Microsoft around and a great OS like Windows!
1 - I work for SCO.

Include your favorite distribution.  As any good zealot knows, there can 
be only one!

K - Knoppix (et al)	L - Linux From Scratch	M - Mandriva
P - Puppy		R - Red Hat		S - Slackware		
U - Ubuntu (et al)	V - Vector

O - other distro of your choosing!  There are more distros than letters 
and they come, go and merge faster than I can update.  So, here is 
the syntax for adding your favorite:  Add your distro's name 
immediately after the O and append a slash (/) character, example: 
"lOgNewSense/" for those FSF-and-Ubuntu combo enthusiasts.  The O 
modifier must be the LAST listed for this category to minimize confusion.


i - IDE/Text Editor environment

As everyone seem to have their own favorite text editor, numbers will 
both show your IDE/integration interest as well as your fave environment.

1 - ed				J - jEdit
0 - cat				L - Idle

O - other IDE of your choosing!  Yes we've almomst run out of letters 
for IDEs, so here is the syntax for adding your favorite editor or IDE:
Add your program immediately after the O and append a slash (/) 
character, example: "iOBBEdit/" for those BBEdit fans out there, or 
"iOdd/" for those true unix badasses (not).  The O modifier must be the 
LAST listed for this category to minimize confusion.

    be hacking!) but for completeness it is included.

9 - I'm Max Headroom.
8 - I've long since given up other things like a job, talking to other 
    people and leaving my house.  I have an IV and dialysis so I don't have 
    to worry about pesky bodily functions.
7 - I watch TV religiously.  The television is never shut off on my house.  
    I have a generator so I can watch TV even when there's a power outage!

9 - I'm obsessed with reading.  I actually write my own 
    short stories/poetry as well as reading books.
8 - I'm kind of a bookworm, I try to read a book a week/month.

cracker, or is it?

9 - I have my own encryption algorithm named after me.
8 - I can crack Enigma in my head.

4 - I don't use encryption.   I have nothing to hide.
3 - Encryption is needless overhead.  If you use it, you must have 
    something to hide!
2 - Only terrorists use encryption.  The government should have back 
    doors to all encryption mechanisms.
1 - Only the government should be able to use encryption to be able to 
    keep its secrets safe!


g - Gaming.  Be it console or PC, video gaming is popular among some hackers.

9 - I am John Carmack.
8 - I've developed the occasional game.  People consider me to be a

IV Life & Lifestyle - "work unfriendly" section - Yes people working at
evil megacorporations have been chastised for having these sections in
their hackerkeys, so we will move this section to the end.  Note that
ALL sections are OPTIONAL, but this one in particular you may want to
leave out.

a - Age.

[0-9][0-9] - Actual Age		
[0-9]X - I only feel like updating my age once per decade!
F - 100+ (Old Fart)
I - Immortal
N - N/A, or None of your business


s - Sex - If we didn't have it, where would the babies come from?

9 - I'm Jenna Jameson.

6 - I've had sex more than a few times.  Still out there in the dating 
    scene so let's not get into numbers.
5 - I've had sex.  Next subject.
4 - I haven't had sex, not that I haven't had the opportunity but I'm 
    saving myself.
3 - I haven't even gotten past second base.  Once my face clears up I'm
    gonna get some though!
2 - Sex is dirty!  Save it for someone you love!

M - Male	G - Gay/Lesbian		S - Single	T - Transvestite
F - Female	B - BiSexual		R - Married	D - BDSM
W - Swinger				I - Involved (dating)


r - Religion.  Generally Hackers believe in something, even if it's just 
    their favorite OS.  Others have an actual opinion about a Higher Power.

9 - I Am God, you foolish mortal!
8 - Pantheist - The Universe IS God.
7 - Pagan/Wiccan - I worship nature moreso than a deity.
6 - Polytheist - I believe in multiple Gods.
5 - Monothiest - There is only one God who exists.
4 - Theist - God exists and interacts with the world and His/Her/Its 
    followers.
3 - Deist - God exists, but does not intervene in the world.
2 - Agnostic - Unsure of God's existence.
1 - Atheist - There is no God.


p - Politics

For version 4, use the ratings from the Political Compass 
(www.politicalcompass.org) website.  Just list your "Economic 
Left/Right" and "Social Libertarian/Authoritarian" scores with a slash 
between them, or round up/down to the nearest whole number to save space 
(preferred).  Yes, the (-) symbol is not valid PGP, but at least the 
category is now somewhat useful.

If you only list one number in this category it will be assumed to be 
the Social Libertarian/Authoritarian rating, as social issues tend to be 
more important to hackers

Example (both categories): p-4.20/-5.10 or (preferably) p-4/-5
Example (social only): p6.10 or (preferably) p6

<h3><a name="feedback"></a>Feedback - Please!</h3>
The Guide is still quite young, and I'm very interested in hearing your
opinions about what you like, don't like and think the Guide needs or
doesn't need.&nbsp; Please don't suggest radical changes to the
structure itself of the code, as this is the one area I'm fairly
comfortable with.&nbsp; Email your thoughts to <a
