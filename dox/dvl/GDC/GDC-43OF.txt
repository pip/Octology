Wed. 4-5 Tools Production Roundtable   Walker/Weinstein
 mostly dominated by Microsoft dudes
 they have awesome server request system which automates builds, regression
   tests, etc. with checkins so everyone has fast (4.5mins) access to latests
 some teams have lost (or got corrupted) big binary data in SourceSafe
 others use Perforce, AlienBrain, && CVS more happily
 common curiosity about SubVersion but nobody trusts it yet
 generally smaller more specialized tools are employed than big do-it-alls
 I mentioned that we were moving towards xml
 session gobbled up by 3 Microsoft dudes being all proud of C# && not relating
   well to others

Wed. 5:30-6:30 AI: Light && Dark Sides  Peter Molyneux
 state machines are not really AI
 potential for deep living simulated worlds which are consistent apart from
   player influence / interaction
 learn type / abilities / reflex speed of player && make games react
 save player AI profile && carry over into other games as appropriate
   eg. RTS rushdown aggressive player is probably similarly aggressive in FPS
   so AI enemies can account for that
 MMORPGs can be better when AI plays for / like player when not controlling
 Agents can have complex influences into behavior but very hard to test / tune
 important to have clear feedback for which training is reinforced

PSP is gonna be huge
Death Jr. looks cool
