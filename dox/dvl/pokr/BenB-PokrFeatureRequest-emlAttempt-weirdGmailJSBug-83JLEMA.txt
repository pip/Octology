Hi Ben,

Thanks for the appreciation && recommendation for useful new features. I
have intention of updating my CPAN modules within the next month or two,
after I can get moved into a new place && have my development machine
setup... so I'll see if I can add what you seem to be asking for... &&
I'll try to notify you. Please feel free to send me your 287-lines of
code which compute the flop && I'll be glad to learn from it or
incorporate it into the next release I can prepare.

Thanks again for the kind feedback. =)

Sincerely,
-Pip@CPAN.Org
