<h1>A Glass of Water</h1>

Last year, I was asked by some aspiring cookbook writers
to provide a recipe for a glass of water.  I don't think
the recipe was ever published, but because of the significant
research that went into developing it, I have decided to
present it herewith.

<p>
<b>Glass of Water &agrave; la Craig</b>
<p>

<dl>
<dd>
	Craig's glass of water recipe has been delighting parched palates
	for decades in Europe.  With some experimentation, I was able to 
	recreate that special taste for the well-equipped kitchen.  Try
	adding a teaspoon each of cadmium and selenium for a delightful 
	ruby tint!

<p>
<dt><b>Ingredients</b>:</dt>
	
<p>
<dd>
	6 ounces sand (preferably silica)<br>
	2 ounces soda ash<br>
	2 tablespoons ground limestone<br>
</dd>

<p>
<dt><b>Directions</b>:</dt>

<p>
<dd><ol>
	<li>Preheat oven to 2800 degrees.</li>
	<li>In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix until very 
		evenly distributed.</li>
	<li>Slowly transfer to a thick stone casserole dish, pausing
	   frequently to allow batch to heat up.</li>
	<li>Bring to a boil, cover, and bake at 2800 degrees for 7 to 10
	   hours, or until batch is transparent and syrupy.  Stir occasionally.
	   </li>
	<li>When ready, open oven slowly and let the batch cool down to 
	   working temperature.</li>
	<li>As batch begins to harden, form it into a receptacle shape.
	   Careful -- molten glass will be hot.  When desired form is
	   reached, allow to cool to room temperature.</li>
	<li>Fill with water and serve immediately.</li>
