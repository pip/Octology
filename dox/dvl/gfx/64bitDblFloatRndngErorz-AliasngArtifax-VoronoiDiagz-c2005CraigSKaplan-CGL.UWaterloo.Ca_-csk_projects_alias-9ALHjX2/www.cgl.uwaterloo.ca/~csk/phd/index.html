	Inspired by the wonderful page
	Robert Glenn Scharein has dedicated to his PhD thesis
	<em><a href="http://www.knotplot.com/thesis/">Interactive Topological Drawing</a></em>, I decided
	to give my own thesis a happy little home on the internet.  Like Robert,
	I wanted to include some of the figures from the thesis with which
	I was particularly pleased.  From this page, you can download my
	thesis in a couple of different formats suitable for on-screen
	viewing or printing.  You can also sample some of my favourite pages.
	<p>
	If you enjoy looking at pretty thesis pages, I also recommend the
	finely illustrated work of Sascha Rogmann:
	<em><a href="http://www.rogmann.org/math/diplom/">Wachstumsfunktionen
	von Pflasterungen</a></em>.  Sadly, I can't read German.

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>
	Throughout history, geometric patterns have formed an
	important part of art and ornamental design.  Today
	we have unprecedented ability to understand ornamental
	styles of the past, to recreate traditional designs, and
	to innovate with new interpretations of old styles and with
	new styles altogether.
	</p>
	<p>
	The power to further the study and practice of ornament stems from
	three sources.  We have new mathematical tools: a modern
	conception of geometry that enables us to describe with
	precision what designers of the past could only hint at.
	We have new algorithmic tools: computers and the abstract
	mathematical processing they enable allow us to perform
	calculations that were intractable in previous generations.
	Finally, we have technological tools: manufacturing devices
	that can turn a synthetic description provided by a computer
	into a real-world artifact.  Taken together, these three
	sets of tools provide new opportunities for the application
	of computers to the analysis and creation of ornament.
	</p>
	<p>
	In this dissertation, I present my research in the
	area of computer-generated geometric art and ornament.
	I focus on two projects in particular.  First
	I develop a collection of tools and methods
	for producing traditional Islamic star patterns.
	Then I examine
	the tessellations of M.C. Escher, developing an
	&ldquo;Escherization&rdquo; algorithm that can derive novel Escher-like
	tessellations of the plane from arbitrary user-supplied
	shapes.  Throughout,
	I show how modern mathematics, algorithms, and technology
	can be applied to the study of these ornamental styles.

	<h2>Download</h2>
	<p>
	My thesis contains a lot of graphics, and so resolution does
	matter.  However, higher-resolution images make for much larger 
	PDFs.  Therefore, I'm making several versions available.

			<a href="kaplan_diss_full_screen.pdf">kaplan_diss_full_screen.pdf</a> (10.3MB)</li>

	<h2>Errata</h2>
	<p>
	Whenever possible, one's thesis should be write-only.  Nevertheless,
	I understand if once in a while a visitor to this page may choose
	to read what I've written.  Shockingly, this hypothetical reader
	may occasionally run across errors of spelling, punctuation, grammar, 
	citation, cross-reference, exposition, fact, content, organization, intent, 
	and overall structure.  Some of these errors may even be unintentional.
	I welcome you to <a href="http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/">send me</a>
	any errors you find, along with your suggestions, criticisms, and ideas.
	If enough significant errors emerge, I'll add an errata page here.
	</p>

	<h2>Favourite Figures</h2>
	<p>
	I enjoy creating expository diagrams.  My thesis already had
	a great deal of graphics by virtue of being in the field of 
	computer graphics, but I wanted to use graphics as much as possible
	to explain concepts, or failing that to help clarify the writing.
	What follows are some of my favourite figures from the thesis.
	These aren't the results, they're just the pretty diagrams.
	Click on each one for a full-size version and some occasional commentary.
