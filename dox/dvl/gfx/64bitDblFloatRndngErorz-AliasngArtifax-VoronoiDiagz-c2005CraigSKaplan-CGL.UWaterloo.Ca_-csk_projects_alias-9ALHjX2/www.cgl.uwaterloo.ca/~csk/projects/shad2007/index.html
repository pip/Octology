<h1>Geometric Sculpture (Shad Valley 2007)</h1>

<blockquote>
<em>
	The construction of 3D geometric sculptures is a beautiful
	topic that lies at the intersection of art and mathematics.
	I'll introduce some of the math you need to understand the
	structure of symmetric polyhedra.  Then we'll dive in and
	try our hand at several different techniques and materials
	for building geometric sculptures.  Some of these techniques
	are almost like puzzles.  You can come to sharpen your
	intuition for 3D geometry, to build a few pieces of art to
	take home, or to tackle the puzzle of putting these complex
	objects together.
</em>

<p>
<a href="http://www.shad.ca/">Shad Valley</a> is a summer program for
high school students where they learn about math, science, business
and other fun topics.  Part of the program involves signing up for
week-long workshops on various topics.  I was a Shad in 1989 and loved
it.  Given that Waterloo is World Shad Headquarters, it seemed only
natural to contribute back to the program.  I chose geometric sculpture
as my workshop topic, and six Shads signed up: Becca, Wooram, Gabe, Jina,
Seung, and Wendy.
</p>
<p>
There were many possible art-math topics that would have been fun for
Shad Valley, but I chose sculpture because it's hands-on and doesn't
require sitting at a computer.
</p>
<p>
Here's a breakdown of the workshop topics for future reference, together
with links to online resources and photos from our experience.

<h2>Day 1: Introduction and Zometool</h2>
<p>
	I started with a quick introduction to geometric sculpture and
	polyhedra, with enough background material to permit me to derive
	the Platonic and Archimedean solids.  As a first step towards
	building our own sculptures, we constructed many of these simple
	polyhedra from Zometool.  As a grand finale, I then directed
	the whole group in the very hasty construction of a projected 
	four-dimensional 120-cell.  Everyone was very impressed by it!

<h2>Day 2: Tensegrity and Compounds</h2>

<p>
	Tensegrity is a classic subject in geometric sculpture.  There is
	some dispute about its origins, but it seems clear that it originated
	with some combination of insights by Kenneth Snelson and Buckminster
	Fuller, and was popularized by Fuller.  In a tensegrity sculpture,
	members are either in tension or compression.  Rods are used for
	compression, and thin wires for tension, giving the construction a
	light, seemingly gravity-defying look.  After searching around the
	web for a while, I settled on a good scheme for building
	tensegrities.  I cut 5/16" dowels into 4-inch lengths and notched
	the ends with a newly-purchased Dremel (which I had wanted to acquire
	anyway).  A big bag of elastic bands served for tensional elements
	(mental note for next time: don't give 500 elastic bands to a room
	full of high-school students).  The elastics had a tendency to fly
	off the rods, but I eventually discovered
	a good solution for holding them in place.  I bought a few feet of
	latex rubber hose, and cut it into short lengths that fit nice and
	snugly on the ends of the rods.
</p>
<p>
	With this tensegrity system, we each built a tensegrity "tetrahedron".
	When properly assembled, the rods fall into a configuration of the
	long edges of three mutually perpendicular golden rectangles 
	(not coincidentally, the rectangles that define the vertices of an
	icosahedron).  Perhaps I should post step-by-step instructions for
	building this shape; send me email if you're reading this and I'll
	consider it.  Then we broke into groups and built some larger sculptures,
	such as the dodecahedron in the photographs.
</p>
<p>
	After that was done, I wanted to use the rest of the day and the
	beginning of the next day to build compounds, both to see these
	lovely objects and to do some classical paper polyhedral construction.
	We built two of my favourites, the compound of four cubes and the compound
	of five tetrahedra.

For convenience, I've collected some of the later compound photos,
which were actually from the following morning, in this section.

<h2>Day 3: Compounds and Modular Origami</h2>

<p>
	We began the day by finishing up our compound models.  (Overall,
	our workmanship on the compounds was a bit below par; I couldn't
	resist returning to the subject the following week and meticulously
	building another cube compound myself.)
</p>
<p>
	Then we turned to modular origami, in which many small units are
	composed together, usually making up the edges of a polyhedral model.
	This is perhaps the cheapest and most easily accessible sculpture
	technique we tried, since all you really need is a bunch of paper
	squares.  I opted for a few coloured memo pads instead of more
	expensive origami paper.  The origami paper is more expensive, though
	it has the advantage that it's only coloured on one side, which can
	give you some attractive contrasts in finished models.
</p>
<p>
	I showed everyone how to make Sonobe units, which we assembled into
	cubes and spiky icosahedra.  Then the more experienced orgamists
	moved to the 180 degree Penultimate unit and built a dodecahedron.

	<li>Again, it's very easy to find information on modular origami
		on the web.  As always <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_origami">Wikipedia</a> is a decent place to start.</li>
	<li>There are many variations on the Sonobe unit that produce
		different appearences when assembled.  We used a relatively
		simple one as shown in <a href="http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/sonobe.pdf">these instructions</a>, but see also 
		<a href="http://www.math.lsu.edu/~verrill/origami/sonobe/">this
		one</a>.  It's easy to experiment with this unit.</li>
	<li>We used Jim Plank's <a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/pics/origami/penultimate/pentagon.html">108 degree Penultimate Module</a> for 
		the dodecahedron.  It's actually a very clever bit of folding
		that produces a close approximation of a 108 degree angle.
		You don't have to start with a 4x3 piece of paper (4x4 works too),
		though the results are a bit cleaner.</li>

<h2>Day 4: Modular Kirigami</h2>

<p>
On the final day, we came at last to the ultimate test of manual dexterity,
geometric intuition, and puzzle-solving ability.  The task was to assemble
copies of <em>Deep Sea Tango</em>, a sculptural puzzle created by George
Hart.  The sculpture is in a form that George calls "Modular Kirigami":
a set of precut paper elements that interlock without glue or tape.
The elements are complex in shape, and would be difficult to cut from
paper if it were not for the craft cutter that I used to cut them
automatically.  Nevertheless, it still took the whole morning to get
the sculptures assembled!  George tells me that I'm probably the second person
ever to assemble one of these sculptures, which means that the Shads
were the third through eighth.  Nicely done!
