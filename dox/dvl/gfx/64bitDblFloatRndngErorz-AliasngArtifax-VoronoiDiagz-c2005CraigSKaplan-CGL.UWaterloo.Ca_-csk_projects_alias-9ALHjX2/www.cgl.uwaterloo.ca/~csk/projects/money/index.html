<h1>Common Currency</h1>
<p>
June 22nd, 2005
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/projects/valentine/">previous
experiment</a>, I explored amalgamations on the occasion of Valentine's Day.
A correspondent came across that page and suggested that banknotes might
make another good subject for an amalgamation.  The idea is a natural one.
The set of banknotes issued by any given country over one time
period tend to have a lot of common structure.  Of course, I chose to take 
a look at Canadian banknotes, divided into two groups: the issue of 1971-1975
and the issue of 1986-1988. 
</p>
<p>
Presumably, the values of these new bills would be the averages of the notes
from which they were produced.  Thus, based on the 1971-1975 issue, I
offer you the Canadian $26.86 bill:
</p>
<center>
	<p><img src="26.86_front.png" width=600 height=269></p>
	<p><img src="26.86_back.png" width=600 height=270></p>
</center>
<p>
And here, based on the 1986-1988 issue, is the $169.57 bill (this issue
included a thousand dollar bill).
</p>
<center>
	<p><img src="169.57_front.png" width=600 height=270></p>
	<p><img src="169.57_back.png" width=600 height=271></p>
</center>
<p>
The front of the $26.86 bill works very well, as does the obverse of 
the $169.57 bill.  All these images could have been a lot cleaner if 
the source images had been better registered.  For example, the large
"Canada" on the front of the $26.86 could be perfectly crisp, since it's 
in the same spot on every bill.  But I was working with the images I
could obtain, and was not willing to take extra steps to obtain better
images or do the necessary image processing to register them.  Perhaps
another day.
</p>
<p>
These amalgamations also suffer because of the relatively small number of
source images being averaged together.  <a href="http://www.salavon.com/">Jason
Salavon</a>'s works tend to average together dozens or hundreds of
images, whereas each issue only offers seven front images and seven 
obverse images to work from.  I might have
been able to create an interesting result by averaging together hundreds
of notes from all over the world, but I'd have needed to be more selective
in choosing compatible images so as to not end up with a washed out mess.
And again, getting the images is difficult.
</p>
<p>
Those of you concerned for my well-being may wonder exactly how many
laws I'm breaking by posting these images.  Well, I did 
<a href="http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/legislation/repro.html">look
it up</a>, and I should be in the clear.  Obviously, none of these images is
the likeness of any one banknote.  They certainly conform to the
bank's goal that "there is no risk that the reproduced image could be
mistaken for a genuine note or misused by counterfeiters".  I suppose I
could also argue that my use is for educational purposes.  Still, it's best
to be certain.  So I sent a query to the Bank of Canada.  Here's the
response I received the same day, from a senior analyst at the Bank:
</p>
<blockquote style="background: #eeeeee; padding: 4px; border: solid thin black; font-family: Courier, monospace;">
The Bank of Canada has no particular problem with this provided that the
images only appear on your Web site and are not used to create something
that could be confused as a genuine bank note.
</blockquote>
<p>
Mind you, it would be fun to whip out one of these bills at a store
and watch the cashier rub their eyes and wipe their glasses.
