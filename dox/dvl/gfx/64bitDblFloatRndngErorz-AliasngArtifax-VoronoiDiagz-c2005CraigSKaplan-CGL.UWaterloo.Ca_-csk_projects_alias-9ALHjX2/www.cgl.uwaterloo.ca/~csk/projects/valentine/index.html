<h1><img src="funny_title.png" width=500 height=78 border=0 alt="My Funny Valentine"/></h1>

February 14th, 2005
<p>
I'm a fan of artist <a href="http://www.salavon.com/">Jason Salavon</a>.
I especially like his series of works he calls
<a href="http://www.salavon.com/workAma.php">amalgamations</a>.  Typically,
he takes a large collection of images and averages them all together.
Now, in general you shouldn't expect this process to produce anything other
than a dull gray image.  Salavon's knack comes in his choice of subject
matter.  He finds a collection of images that loosely share some common 
structure.  When the images are averaged together, individual features are
washed away but the overall structure remains.
<p>
Browsing in the drugstore the other day, I wondered whether Valentine's 
Day cards might have enough structure to make an interesting amalgamation.  
After all, they tend to be pink-to-red in colour and feature hearts, roses,
or other squooshy lovey-dovey things.
<p>
After a bit of experimentation, I settled on a collection of images downloaded
from the web.  The images came from greeting card company web sites and Google
image searches.  They were resized uniformly to fit inside a 512x512 pixel
rectangle, and then averaged together.  Here is the result:
<p>
<center>
	<a href="interior.png"><img src="avg2.png" width=512 height=512 border=0></a>
	<br>
	<em>51 Valentines</em>
</center>
<p>
Many of the images were of heart-shaped mylar balloons.  Each such image
came with a product number written in bold black text in the bottom left.
The black smear in the bottom left of my valentine is the average of all
those product numbers.
<p>
If you're thinking of printing out this image and using it as a real
valentine, I've been kind enough to provide a second image to use for
the interior.  Just click on the valentine to see the other image.
Of course, it's intended to be for a wife; you might need to make your
own if you're giving it to someone else.
<p>

Here are two earlier attempts based on sets of images with much less
coherent structure.  The first is an averaging of 19 Valentine's Day
cards from one greeting card company.  The second is 73 cards from a 
different company.  The one thing you can definitely detect is a 
general trend towards pinkness.  There is a small amount of heart
visible in the second.
