<h1>Rotated Square Illusion</h1>

<p>
Years ago, I randomly decided to experiment with a simple form of
abstract tone reproduction.  Take a low-resolution image and represent
the darkness of each pixel by a black square whose area is proportional
to that darkness.  If the squares were all disconnected from each other,
you'd end up with an attractive arrangement of different-sized squares
that, when looked at the right way, would yield an image as a kind of
optical illusion.  To add a bit more character, I decided to orient each
square in the direction of the image gradient of its pixel.  I packed
the whole thing into a tiny Python script that generated Postscript
output.
</p>
<p>
As it happens, the results were decent.  Here's an example, a scaled-down
photo of a cat (<a href="http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/photos/chaos_talon/dscn1862.jpg.html">this one</a>, to be exact), and its corresponding squares.
The illusion is most effective if you experiment with different distances
from your monitor, different viewing angles, and different amounts of
squinting.

I just finished reading <a href="http://processing.org/learning/books/">
Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists</a>,
by Casey Reas and Ben Fry.  <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> is
a Java-based development environment and toolkit developed at the MIT Media
Lab, targeted at the world of new media and digital art (in the style of
other tools like Max/MSP, PureData, etc).  There were things about Processing
that I didn't understand and wanted to learn more about, and I was offered
an opportunity to write a review of the book for a journal.  It's a good
book for a number of reasons (I'll save the full discussion for the review).
</p>
<p>
One fun aspect of Processing is that it provides access to a lot of
sophisticated functionality in a simple (almost simplistic, actually) way.
They give even experienced programmers extra value over writing Java code
directly by streamlining the common cases in a way that removes obstacles
between inspiration and implementation.  For example, they provide an
extension library that simplifies access to webcams.  In the past year or
two I've acquired several webcams (attached to iMacs), and I figured that
my square illusion code could easily run in real-time.  Thus, I implemented
a webcam-based version of the Python script as a first experiment in
Processing.  In a couple of hours I was up and running.  I captured an
image of myself scrutinizing the book.

The PDF export is tied to key presses; what you can't see in this image
is that I'm hitting the space bar with my toe to capture the result.
</p>
<p>
I tweaked the script a bit to make it more pleasant to use in real-time.
Most of the work consisted of damping the changes in size and orientation
so that the entire screen wouldn't jitter.  I also threw away small
gradients.  Unfortunately it doesn't
appear to run as an applet, presumably because of the difficulty of
in-browser camera access.
But if anyone is interested, feel free to grab the <a href="square_illusion.pde">source code</a> and try it out in a local copy of Processing.
</p>
<p>
A few years ago, I took the cat image above and had all the little
squares cut from paper using a laser cutter.  I then mounted the 
cut paper slightly above a dark backdrop.  The illusion was particularly
satisfying when the image coalesced out of a grid of holes in paper.
The PDF output built-in to the source code above should allow anyone
to create such a design with a laser cutter or digital craft cutter.
Let me know if you try it.
