The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is an old and well-studied problem
in computer science.  Given a collection of cities on a map, a salesman
must make a tour of the cities, visiting each once, and returning to the
city from which he started.  Of all the ways that he could travel from
city to city, he must find the one that requires him to travel the least
total distance (our salesman is nothing if not frugal).
Mathematically, we can view this form of the TSP as finding the minimum
length closed path connecting a collection of points in the plane.
<p>
The tour that results from a collection of cities tends to have some of
the same density properties as the collection itself.  In other words,
in regions where cities are packed tightly together, you get a lot of
traveling in tight little knots; where cities are spaced out, you tend 
to travel in long straightaways.  When the tour is drawn (say, as a black
line on a white background), the darkness of the picture will correspond
roughly to the density of the cities.
<p>
We can exploit this relationship to produce a new 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">halftoning</a> algorithm
(halftoning is any process that approximates a continuous-toned image with
black-and-white marks).  We distribute cities with a density that 
locally approximates the darkness of a source image, and pass the cities
to a program that finds a TSP tour.  The result is a kind of twisty
closed path that resembles the original image.
<p>
How do we distribute cities?  Our goal is to place points in a way that
approximates an image.  That is itself a form of halftoning, and is a 
area of computer graphics rich with solutions.  We make use of two approaches.
<a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~ajsecord/stipples.html">Weighted Voronoi
stippling</a> uses optimization to space out a collection of points evenly
while still conveying image tone. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithering">Ordered dithering</a>
selectively turns pixels on and off in fixed patterns.  Both approaches
produce city distributions suitable for the TSP, and yield dramatically
different final images.
<p>
To produce the final tour, we pass the cities obtained above to the
<a href="http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/concorde.html">Concorde TSP Solver</a>.
We don't try to find the true optimal solution; the reason why we shouldn't
expect to do so is what makes the TSP such an interesting problem in 
computer science!  But Concorde produces
a heuristic solution that's more than good enough aesthetically.  Most
importantly, the path it produces never crosses itself; it can be proven
that an optimal solution never will.
<p>
Once we have the tour, we can draw it pretty easily as a closed polygon.
Fancier rendering styles are possible, such as varying the thickness of
the lines or curving them.

Here are several sample images of TSP Art.  Clicking on each one will
open a PDF of the same image (because this is line art, the PDFs work
much better).  Some results are based on photographs by

Ivars Peterson wrote an article about TSP Art for the April 2005 issue
of <a href="http://www.cricketmag.com/ProductDetail.asp?pid=12">Muse
Magazine</a>.  Note that the article falsely attributes the technique
to Robert Bosch and Adrianne Herman.  They worked together on an earlier
version of TSP art; all the pictures here (and the penguins that appear
in the magazine) were produced by a more recent collaboration between me
and Robert.  The magazine will publish a correction in late 2005.
<p>
Robert Bosch's <a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/math/faculty/bosch.html">home
page</a> has links to his previous paper on TSP art and sample images.
<p>
A couple of years ago, a colleague sent me some photos of billboards in
downtown Los Angeles that have images strikingly similar to TSP Art.
I'm happy to say that we now know who the artist is.  J. Eric Morales
(Mo) has a <a href="http://www.virtualmo.com/">website</a> where you
can see his TSP Art images (he calls them "labyrinthine projections").
<p>
A couple of TSP Art images appear in the 
new <a href="http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/book/index.html">TSP book</a> by 
Applegate, Bixby, Chv&aacute;tal and Cook.
