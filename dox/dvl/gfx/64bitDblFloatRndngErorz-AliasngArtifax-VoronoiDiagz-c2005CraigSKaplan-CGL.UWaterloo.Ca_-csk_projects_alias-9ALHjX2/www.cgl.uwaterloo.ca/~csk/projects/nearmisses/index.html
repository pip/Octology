<h1>Near Misses</h1>

<p>
A near miss is a polyhedron that's <em>almost</em> a Johnson solid.
Without formalizing what that means, we might ask that one should be
able to construct the polyhedron out of paper (or some construction
toy), using only regular faces, without noticing the discrepancy.  
</p>
<p>
To our knowledge, there has never been a rigorous study of near misses,
though one would imagine they were looked at carefully in the 
classification of Johnson solids.  If anybody knows of such a study,
please <a href="http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/">let me know</a>.

<em>I</em>(2,4,*,<b>e</b>): 12 decagons, 20 dodecagons, 60 almost
	equilateral triangles (these are actually trapezoids with very 
	narrow tops), 30 very narrow rectangles.
	<p>
	This solid is very similar to a truncated buckyball.  One imagines 
	that by fiddling with it a bit, one could sacrifice the perfect
	regularity of the decagons and dodecagons in exchange for eliminating
	the narrow rectangular faces, resulting in a near miss.

[no notation] 
<p>
A solid constructed by inscribing a regular 11-gon in every
face of a pentagonal icositetrahedron.  The result is a little
loose, but there's room for improvement by starting with a 
differently-parameterized base solid.
<p>
Alex Doskey was kind enough to contribute WRL files for this
solid: <a href="Hendecagons.WRL">Solid</a>, <a href="HendecagonsF.WRL">Leonardo-style</a>.
