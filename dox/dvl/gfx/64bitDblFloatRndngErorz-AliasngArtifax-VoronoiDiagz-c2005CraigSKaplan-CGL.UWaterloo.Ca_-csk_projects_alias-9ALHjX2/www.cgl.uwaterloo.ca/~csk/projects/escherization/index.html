Over his life, the Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher created over
a hundred ingenious tesselations in the plane.
Some were simple and geometric, used as prototypes for more complex
endeavors.  But in most the tiles were recognizable animal forms
such as birds, fish and reptiles.
The definitive reference on Escher's divisions of the plane is Doris
Schattschneider's <em>Visions of Symmetry</em>, now in a second edition.
A good place to view some of Escher's work online is 
the <a href="http://www.worldofescher.com/">World of Escher</a>.
Be sure also to check out these examples from Escher's notebook:
<a href="http://www.kalymnos-isl.gr/dimitri/escher/Lizards_symmetry-1939.html">E25</a>,
<a href="http://www.kalymnos-isl.gr/dimitri/escher/Butterflies-Symmetry-1938.html">E70</a>, and
<a href="http://www.kalymnos-isl.gr/dimitri/escher/fish&boats-symmetry-1948.html">E72</a>.
<p>
Escher was able to discover such tilings through a combination of
natural ability and sheer determination.  Can we automate the discovery
of tilings by recognizable motifs?  More formally, we pose the 
<em>Escherization problem</em>: 
<p>
<blockquote>
	Given a shape <em>S</em>, find a new shape <em>T</em> such that:
	<ol>
	<li><em>T</em> is as close as possible to <em>S</em>; and
	<li>Copies of <em>T</em> fit together to form a tiling of the plane.
	</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
We have developed an algorithm that can produce reasonable solutions to
the Escherization problem.  It is based on three large components:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>A parameterized space of tilings.</b>  We develop a parameterization
	    of the space of isohedral tilings, a family of tilings that 
		can express the designs Escher created.  Every possible tile 
		shape boils down to a sequence of real numbers.  An interactive
		tool lets us modify these numbers in a natural way (corresponding
		to Escher manipulating drawings by hand).  More importantly, we
		can direct the computer to search through possible sequences of
		numbers, trying to find good tilings by brute force.
	</li>
	
	<li><b>A comparison function for shapes.</b>  We can dial up a collection
	    of tile shapes using the parameterization above.  We need to know
		how well each of these tiles approximates the goal shape provided
		by the user.  We use a metric from the computer vision 
		literature that efficiently finds the L<sup>2</sup> distance 
		between two polygons.  Our objective then becomes to locate the
		particular tile shape that compares most favourably to the goal
		shape.
	</li>

	<li><b>An optimization algorithm.</b>  We need a meaningful strategy
	    for sorting through the large shape of possible tile shapes for 
		the best one (the one that's closest to the goal shape).  We use
		a simulated annealing algorithm from <em>Numerical Recipes</em>.
		When suitably tuned, it tends to find good tile shapes without 
		getting stuck in objectionable local minima.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dihedral Escherization</h2>

<p>
Escher also created a number of dihedral tilings: designs featuring
two different shapes.  He was fond of these designs, since with more
than one shape it was possible to tell a story, to have the shapes
complement each other somehow.
</p>
<p>
The Escherization problem can be adapted in an obvious way to two 
goal shapes.  We can also extend the space of tilings by including
in the parameterization a path that splits an isohedral tile shape into
two pieces.  We compare the two pieces to the goal shapes and run
the optimization as before, attempting to minimize the maximum of 
the two comparisons.

<p>
Dihedral Escherization can also be exploited to create designs in 
the style of Escher's 
<em><a href="http://www.worldofescher.com/gallery/jpgs/P8L.jpg">Sky and 
Water</a></em>.  We need to restrict 
the search to a narrower class of possible tiling types (what Dress
calls &ldquo;Heaven and Hell Patterns&rdquo;).  Once the desired
tiling has been discovered the rest of the process is fairly easy,
since we already have an association between a realistic, user-supplied
goal shape and an abstract, more geometric tile shape.  We just need
to morph between those two extremes.  Here's one example, based on
<em>Rembrandt and Mrs. van Rijn</em> above.

<h2>Aperiodic Escherization</h2>

<p>
The Penrose tilings P2 (kites and darts) and P3 (thin and thick rhombs)
can also be parameterized and fed to the Escherization system.  It's
much harder to discover satisfying results, because of the idiosyncratic
shapes of the Penrose tiles.  It's exciting to be able to produce these
aperiodic pictures &ndash; Penrose and Escher were friends, but sadly
Escher passed away before Penrose discovered P2 and P3.  Penrose has
asked what sorts of designs Escher would have been able to create from
these tilings.

You might enjoy playing with the edges of Penrose tiles to see whether
you can produce recognizable shapes.  I've created a
<a href="http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/software/penrose/">Java applet</a>
that lets you do so interactively.

<h2>Non-Euclidean Escherization</h2>

<p>
Escher made four wonderful <em>Circle Limit</em> patterns, designs
based on non-Euclidean geometry.  Escher didn't have the mathematical 
background to manipulate hyperbolic patterns symbolically, but he certainly
had the intuition necessary to create pictures of them.
</p>
<p>
Our Escherization algorithm cannot easily be translated into non-Euclidean
geometry, for deep reasons having to do with the notion of shape, as used
in the shape comparison metric.  However, for some isohedral tiling types
it is possible to transfer the <em>output</em> of Escherization from 
the Euclidean plane to the hyperbolic plane or to the surface of a sphere.
The process is a kind of non-linear warp of a piece of the Escherized tiling.

<h2>Software</h2>

The SIGGRAPH 2000 paper mentions
a couple of files used by the system to describe the isohedral
tilings.  Copies of these are available here, with a few updates.
<p>
<dl>
	<dt><a href="isohedral.ih.txt">isohedral.ih</a> 
		(last updated: May 8th, 2002)
	<dd>This file contains specifications for the representation and
	    drawing of the 81 isohedral tilings realizable by unmarked tiles.
		Among other things, it provides the incidence symbol, a simple
		colouring, and a set of rules for deriving aspect transform
		matrices.
	<p>
	<dt><a href="geo.py.txt">geo.py</a> and <a href="params.py.txt">params.py</a>
	<dd>These two files together provide a script for navigating the 
	    tiling vertex parameterizations of the isohedral tiling types.
		params.py contains a function for each unique parameterization,
		and can be used as a source from which to build your own library
		for parameterizing legal isohedral tiling polygons.
</dl>

<p>
I have also made a Java applet that allows you to explore the space of
Penrose tile shapes interactively.  It's a fun way to play with this
rather mysterious tiling.  Most of the effort related to aperiodic tilings
seems to be related to their combinatorial properties, without considering
the actual shapes that can be produced.  You can try the applet
<a href="http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/software/penrose">here</a>.
