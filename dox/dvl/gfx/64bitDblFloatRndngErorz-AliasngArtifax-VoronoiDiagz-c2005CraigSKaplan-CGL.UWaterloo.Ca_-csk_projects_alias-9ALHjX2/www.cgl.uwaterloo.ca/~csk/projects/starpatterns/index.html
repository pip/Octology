<h1>Islamic Star Patterns</h1>

<p>
Islamic star patterns arose in the centuries after the birth of Islam,
and spread quickly as Islamic rule grew outward from the Middle East 
to encompass western Europe, northern Africa, and southern Asia.  This
form of ornamentation peaked in the first half of the second millennium.
The practice then tapered off as the borders of the Muslim world began
to shrink.  Today, historical artifacts can be found in countries from
Spain to Uzbekistan, with important concentrations in Spain, Turkey, Iran,
and Morocco.
</p>
<p>
There is no precise definition of an Islamic star pattern, but there
are some general trends.  They tend to be rigidly geometric in design, 
and feature star-shaped polygonal regions.  They can be found carved
in wood or stone, built from latticework, or assembled from baked
terracotta tiles (a style known as <em>Zellij</em>).
</p>
<p>
Although we have a large body of historical examples to study, we 
don't know exactly how artisans working at the time designed their
star patterns.  Their methods were typically guarded as trade secrets.
Thus we are left with the exciting historical puzzle of reverse 
engineering lost techniques, or inventing new ones altogether.
We know that Islamic scholars had mastered Euclid's <em>Elements</em>,
and so we can ascribe to them an advanced knowledge of plane geometry.
Of course, we have many more mathematical tools available today
than existed a thousand years ago, and we should utilize those tools
in the service of ornamental design.  I am interested in understanding
how star patterns may have been designed in the first place, and how
we can enlarge the space of designs using what we know today.  I am
also interested in how to render star patterns and how to manufacture
them automatically from computer descriptions.
</p>

<h2>Designing star patterns</h2>

<p>
I have developed two software approaches for constructing star patterns.
Both are based on first choosing a tiling of the plane called the
<em>template tiling</em>.  Each tile in the template is then associated
with a motif, a small fragment of an overall design.  Tiles are filled
with motifs, and connected together.  When the template is erased, the
result is a star pattern.
</p>
<p>
The first approach, which I now call the "Najm method", makes use of
an explicit understanding of the radially-symmetric motifs that appear
in many star patterns.  The user chooses specific radially-symmetric
motifs for each regular polygon in the template tiling.  The computer
can then fill the remaining tiles using an "inference algorithm" to
create a design consistent with the user's choices.  
</p>
<p>
The second approach, which I call the "Hankin method", does away with
explicit motifs and uses only the inference algorithm.  In order to 
obtain some of the characteristic motifs (like rosettes) that are
common in star patterns, the Hankin method embeds more intelligence in 
the template tilings.  The interesting question then becomes to compute
these new tilings.
</p>

More information can be found in the papers mentioned below.  Here are
a few star patterns produced using these methods.  Click on each for

<h2>Non-Euclidean star patterns</h2>

<p>
Once we have articulated these design techniques mathematically, we have
an opportunity to do things that were either impractical or impossible with
the mathematical and artistic tools of previous centuries.  One long-standing
possibility is to construct non-Euclidean Islamic star patterns.  I 
have shown that we can express the construction techniques above independently
of Euclid's parallel postulate, and that therefore they apply equally
well to the Euclidean plane, the hyperbolic plane, and the surface of the
sphere.  In fact, I construct star patterns in <em>absolute geometry</em>,
an abstract core from which the three planar geometries can be derived.
By suitably encoding this geometric foundation in a C++ library, I need only 
write the design algorithm once.

Some examples tell the story best...

<h2>Islamic parquet deformations</h2>

<p>
Parquet deformations are an abstract form of ornament first introduced
by William Huff as an exercise for his Architecture students, and later
popularized by Douglas Hofstadter in his Scientific American column.
They are a kind of "spatial animation": a tiling of the plane from shapes
that gradually evolve in space.  They are the aesthetic cousins of 
Escher's <em>Metamorphosis</em> prints.
</p>
<p>
We can create Islamic parquet deformations as a simple modification of
Hankin's method.  Given a tiling, Hankin's method is parameterized by
a single real value called the "contact angle".  All we have to do is
gradually change that contact angle in space.  The results are striking
and certainly novel: in centuries past, it would never have been practical
to construct a pattern where almost every shape is unique!

<h2>CAD and star patterns</h2>

<p>
Once we have software that can construct mathematical descriptions of
star patterns, we can do more than simply render images of those star
patterns on the computer screen.  We can also feed the designs to a number
of different computer-controlled manufacturing technologies.  I am generally
interested in how computer graphics might play a role in revitalizing the
use of ornament in architecture, and star patterns are an excellent 
form of ornament to use as a test case.  I have experimented with 3D 
rapid prototyping (ZCorp, FDM), laser cutting, waterjet cutting, and CNC
milling and lathing.  So far, there hasn't been a great deal of research
necessary -- the manufacturing devices do a great job on their own.  But
there are opportunities for work that enhances the cooperation between
designer, software, and machine.

Here are a few photographs of these experiments.

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>
My Java applet 
<a href="http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/washington/taprats/">Taprats</a>
has been available on the web since around 2000.  A few years later I added 
a downloadable version of Taprats that allows you to save designs as 
encapsulated postscript.  It has been downloaded thousands of times and
used by artists, hobbyists, and teachers.  
</p>
<p>
I am not actively developing Taprats right now, though I do have medium-term
plans to release a greatly improved new version.  In the meantime, if you
want a more recent alternative to Taprats, Fran&ccedil;ois Dispot's excellent
<a href="http://www.wozzeck.net/arabeske/index.html">Arabeske Studio</a> is
under more active development.
