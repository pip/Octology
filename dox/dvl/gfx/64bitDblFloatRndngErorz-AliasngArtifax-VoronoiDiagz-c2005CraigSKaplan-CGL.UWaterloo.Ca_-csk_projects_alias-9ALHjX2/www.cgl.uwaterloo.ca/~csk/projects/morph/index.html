<h1>Metamorphoses and deformations</h1>

Escher made repeated use of a family of metamorphosis techniques in his
graphic work.  Perhaps the most famous example of all of these
techniques is his print <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis_II"><em>Metamorphosis
II</em></a>.
<p>
A few decades later, architect William Huff began to assign his students
the task of drawing "Parquet Deformations", abstract designs depicting
tilings that slowly evolve in space.  The results are clearly related
to Escher's metamorphoses, though more abstract and mathematical.
Parquet Deformations were popularized by Douglas Hofstadter in his
Metamagical Themas column in <em>Scientific American</em>, later
reprinted in the book of the same name.
<p>
I have long been interested in trying to formalize these
different styles of metamorphoses and deformations.  Even in the 
relatively simple case of linear interpolation between the shapes of
two tilings, a wide range of attractive decorative possibilities arise.
I include some sample images below with inadequate explanation.
I have also created some related designs inspired by Islamic star
patterns; those are shown on the <a href="../starpatterns/">project
page</a> for that topic.  I discuss the mathematical details of
Escher's <em>Sky-and-Water</em> device in my GI 2004 paper on
dihedral Escherization.
See also my 2008 Bridges paper on the subject.
There are still other aspects of this work that remain sadly unpublished.
