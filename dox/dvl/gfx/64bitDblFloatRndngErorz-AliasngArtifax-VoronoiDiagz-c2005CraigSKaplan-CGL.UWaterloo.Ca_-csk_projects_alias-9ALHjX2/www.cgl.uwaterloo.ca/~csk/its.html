<h1>It's "its"!</h1>
<p>

Okay, look.  I'm a grammar snob.  If you want to be able to communicate
with others, you need to wrap that communication up in an easily digested
package.  You need to pay considerable attention to the form and structure 
of what you're saying as well as the content.  Careless use of language
instills in the reader a lack of confidence in the writer.  In the academic
world, poor grammar is often a further impediment towards
the understanding of already complex material.
<p>
One particular error that never ceases to make me cringe is the misuse of 
the words "it's" and "its".  The distinction between "it's" and "its" was 
first conveyed
to me with great intensity in the eighth grade, by the venerable Donna George
at 
<a href="http://www.westislandcollege.qc.ca/">West Island College</a> in 
Montreal.  For years thereafter I suppressed my 
anger at the apostrophical affront, playing the stoic as best I could.
But as I grow older and more curmudgeonly, and as the grammatical fibre of
our society erodes, my tolerance for this typographical trespass trickles
away.
<p>
Here, then, is my defiant outpost, my barricade against the teeming masses
who would overrun the world with superfluous apostrophes (or, less often,
withhold those apostrophes when they are so rightly required).  Of course,
I would rather build a classroom than a fortress, and so here follows a 
lesson in the correct usage of the words "it's" and "its".  Be kind to
your friend the apostrophe.

<p>
<hr>

<p>
<h2>It's</h2>

"It's" is a contraction.  It is short for "it is" (or occasionally for
"it has").  It's not a way to ascribe a property to some "it".  Yes, I
know that this would make sense given that the general rule for forming
a possessive is to tack on "'s":  fool's errand, brewer's yeast,
horse's ass.  "It's" is an exception to this rule, and I honestly
apologize on behalf of the infuriating English language.  I didn't
invent this stupid rule, but it's hardwired into my brain like gender
of nouns to French speakers.

<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Examples:</b></dt><br>
	<dd><em><b>It's</b> a small world, after all. 
		<b>It's</b> a small world, after all. 
		<b>It's</b> a small world, after all.
		<b>It's</b> a small world, after all.  </em></dd>
	<dd><em>You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around, 
		that's what <b>it's</b> all about.</em></dd>
	<dd><em>Well, <b>it's</b> been a long, been a long, been a long,
		been a long day.</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
<h2>Its</h2>

"Its" is a possessive pronoun.  Its interpretation is something like 
"that which belongs to it", where "it" stands for some previously defined
object.  In the previous sentence, the object being referred to is the word
"its", and the thing that belongs to it is its interpretation.

<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Examples:</b><dt><br>
	<dd><em>He left it dead, and with <b>its</b> head he went galumphing 
	    back</em></dd>
	<dd><em>Love rears <b>its</b> ugly head.</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
<h2>Using them correctly</h2>

With practice, it's easy to tell these two devilish words apart.  To help
you keep them separate, here are some handy tips:

<ul>
	<li>Try replacing your "it's" with "it is" in the sentence.  If 
	    the sentence becomes obviously wrong, you probably meant to use
		"its".  If it sounds okay, "it's" can stay.</li>
		<p>
		<b>Example:</b> "Nothing can take it's place" can't be right, 
		because "Nothing can take it is place" is nonsense.  You probably
		mean "Nothing can take <b>its</b> place".
		<br>
		<b>Example:</b> "It's not easy being green".  Well, "It is not easy" 
		is right, so the original sentence is okay.
		<p>
	<li>Try replacing your "its" with "his" in the sentence.  If it comes
	    out sounding right, "its" can stay.</li>
		<p>
		<b>Example:</b> "That's just its way of making friends" must be okay,
		because "That's just his way of making friends" is grammatical.
		<p>
		In general, "its" as a possessive is like "his".  You wouldn't 
		write "hi's", would you?  Well, maybe you would if you were talking
		about something belonging to Hiram...
		<p>
	<li>Look at the word that follows "its" or "it's".  A noun means that you
	    want "its".  An adjective <em>probably</em> indicates "it's".  This
		isn't always true, but it's a half-decent rule of thumb.
		<p>
		<b>Example:</b> "The cat licks its tongue into the corners of the
		evening".  "Tongue" is a noun.  I probably don't mean "it is tongue",
		so I'll stick with "its".
		<p>
</ul>

<p>

<h2>Where to go from here</h2>

Misuse of the apostrophe carries over into the confusion between the plural 
and possessive forms of nouns.  This is in some sense less forgivable, since
the rule is much more general.  Plural nouns require an "s", and possessives
require an "'s".  Never <em>ever</em> write something like

	<blockquote>The twelve day's of Christmas</blockquote>

That's just wrong, and shouldn't require much thought.  If you make this 
deplorable error, <a href="http://www.angryflower.com/bobsqu.gif">
Bob the Angry Flower</a> will descend on you and mess you up.
<p>
Admittedly, rules involving the apostrophe get somewhat fuzzy in places.
I find it hard to pluralize a word like "printf" used as a noun,
as in "This function contains twenty-two printfs", since that can lead to 
confusion.  I would simply avoid the issue: "This function contains twenty-two
occurrences of printf".
<p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I'm glad I finally got that off my chest.  Sorry to drag on for so long,
but this really is important.  If you want to be understood, you need to
present your thoughts in a way that leaves the fewest barriers to 
comprehension.  The error described here doesn't derail the reader, but
it does present a speed bump, a momentary mental hiccup from which one must
recover.  A moment's thought while writing can make for a smooth ride 
later on.
<p>
I'm not alone in my concern for the proper use of the apostrophe.

<h2>Post scriptum</h2>

<b>July 26th, 1999:</b> Kudos to 
   <a href="http://home.golden.net/~cara/fiona/fiona4.jpg">Zac</a> 
   for discovering a (now corrected)
   typo on this page.  No, it wasn't a misuse of "its" or "it's".

<p>
<b>October 11th, 1999:</b> Chuck was nice enough to point me to 
   a frightening yet excellent collection: actual photos of 
   <a href="http://www.spinnwebe.com/tpa/">incorrect usage</a>
   of the apostrophe.  Proceed with caution!

<p>
<b>December 31st, 2000:</b> I was reviewing the access logs for 
   my web pages today, when I came across the following:
   <p>
   <blockquote><code>
   /homes/csk/its.html (11 hits):<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://google.yahoo.com/bin/query?p="the+twelve+day's+of+christmas+"&amp;hc=0&amp;hs=0 (1)
   </code></blockquote>
   <p>
   What all this means is that someone came across the "it's" page by 
   doing a google search on the phrase "the twelve day's of christmas"
   (presumably in a search for the full lyrics).  Shame on you, whoever
   you are, and I hope I have steered you away from a life of punctuation
   abuse.

<p>
<b>January 10th, 2001:</b> I found this quote in a 
	<a href="">story</a> on cnn.com today:
   <p>
   <blockquote>
   	Indeed, the TWA transaction will provide American with a critical 
	new hub in St. Louis, significantly bolstering it's position as an 
	east/west carrier.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
	I can (almost) understand it when somebody's personal page contains 
	this mistake, or even when the notoriously ungrammatical guys at
	<a href="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot</a> slip up.  But CNN?
	I have great respect for the writing skill of the CNN staff.  Oops -- had.

<p>
<b>May 23rd, 2002:</b> I received an email from Brian Bridson this
	morning.  He points out that for all my hifalutin' grammar 
	snobbishness, this page is riddled with errors.  Specifically,
	the rules of punctuation require that when a quotation is 
	followed by a comma or period, the punctuation mark appear
	<em>before</em> the closing quote, as in "this example."
	So let me warn you: this page should be used only as a guide
	to the apostrophe.  Do not take it as an example of how to
	use the comma or period.  For more information, I invite you
	to read <a href="its_update.html">the response</a> I sent to
	Brian's email.

<p>
<b>August 7th, 2003:</b> Grammar snobs unite!  Jeremy Roberts
	writes to point out that one should not hyphenate two word
	phrases containing adverbs ending in "ly".  I wasn't aware
	of this rule, and I'm following up to determine its full
	scope.  In any case "easily-digested" has been changed to
	"easily digested" in the first paragraph.  Thanks, Jeremy!

<p>
<b>March 9th, 2006:</b> Slowly but surely, we're converging on 
	the most grammatically perfect web page in the world (now
	<em>that's</em> a low standard!).  Bruce Chapman of New Zealand
	spotted a couple of additional typos on this page.  Thanks!

<p>
<b>May 1st, 2006:</b> Thanks to Jeff, who pointed out that "'s" should
	be preceded by "an", not "a".  It's a curious rule, being primarily
	an aid to pronunciation and less relevant in written English.  But
	it's a rule nonetheless.

<p>
<b>October 12th, 2006:</b> Martijn Morrien found a small typo in one of the
	rules of thumb.  It's amazing that people are still sending in corrections
	more than seven years after I wrote this web page.

<p>
<b>November 2nd, 2006:</b> The emails continue to arrive at a furious rate!
	Mary Zarazinsky claimed that this page was "full of misspelled words".
	I beg your pardon?
	For the first time ever, I ran the page through a spellchecker.
	Indeed, I discovered a small number of shocking spelling errors.  Some
	were not so shocking; I have no intention of changing "hifalutin'" into
	"highfaluting", thank you very much.
	<p>
	Separately, Jessica Mullen took offence at my abuse of the comma before
	a dependent conjunctive clause.  That's a personal weakness of mine,
	one that I've decided to leave in.  Sorry, Jessica.  
	<p>
	Man, you  put one innocuous grammar page on the web, and  the
	Donna Georges of the world come out of the woodwork.  Keep
	those cards and letters coming!

<p>
<b>November 2nd, 2006:</b> As an aside, I can't help but  refer to
<a href="http://www.parcdusouvenir.org/equipee.htm">this web page</a>,
which contains a brief bio and photograph  of Donna George.  I find
it especially amusing given that George McLeish, the person immediately 
below her on the page, is a family friend. 

<p>
<b>May 14th, 2007:</b> I received an email about a month and a half
ago praising this web page but asking that I remove the phrase "rule
of thumb".  There is some evidence that the expression goes back to
a ruling in England that a man be permitted to beat his wife with a
stick provided it was no thicker than his thumb.  I confess that I had
not previously heard that theory.  I've decided to let the text stand.
The evidence for the origin of the phrase isn't conclusive, and in
any case the phrase itself is quite divorced from its suspected origins
in modern usage.  The request provoked some interesting discussion,
though. (August 14th, 2007: Richard Bollard offers a link to 
<a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-rul1.htm">this page</a>,
which does a fairly good job of discrediting this hypothetical etymology).

<p>
<b>June 6th, 2007:</b> A few people have inquired about the status of
"its'", with an apostrophe following the "s".  Yes, I can imagine a
very contrived set of circumstances in which one might be able to use
the word "its'".  However, those circumstances will not arise in
day-to-day writing.  Given that this page is concerned with convenient
guidelines, let me simply say this: you will never need to use "its'",
period.  It's probably best to assume that it's not a word at all.

<p>
<b>August 15th, 2007:</b> I'm starting to see why this page gets so
many visitors.  It's currently the top google hit for both of the
individual words "it's" and "its".  To be honest, that freaks me out
a little bit.  On the other hand, having now attained this minor level
of celebrity, I would hate to be ousted.  Link to this page liberally,
and help make it the Official Internet Home of "it's" and "its".

<p>
<b>December 10th, 2007:</b> Thanks to Brian Conradsen for pointing
	out that I should never have used the expression "most grammatically
	perfect" in the update from March 9th, 2006 -- words like "perfect"
	and "unique" should never take intensifiers.  Thus the page is not
	perfect after all, with the comment on perfection serving as its
	own counterexample!  Perhaps I ought to have said "least flawed".
