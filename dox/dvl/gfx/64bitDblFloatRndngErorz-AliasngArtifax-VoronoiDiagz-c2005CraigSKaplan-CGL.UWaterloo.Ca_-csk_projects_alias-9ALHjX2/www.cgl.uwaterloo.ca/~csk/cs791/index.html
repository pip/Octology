<h1>CS 791: Non-photorealistic rendering</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	My grad course is concerned with artistic or ornamental applications
	of computer graphics.  Photorealistic imagery is only one possible
	goal in graphics; when we deliberately back away from that goal,
	we discover new opportunities for communication and expression.
	Although the core of this course lies squarely in computer graphics,
	it incorporates a wide range of ideas from many disciplines such
	as fine art, architecture, design and geometry.
</p>
<p>
	Depending on the offering, the course will tend to focus on either
	the painterly or the geometric side of non-photorealistic graphics,
	though every offering will contain elements of both ends of the
	spectrum.
