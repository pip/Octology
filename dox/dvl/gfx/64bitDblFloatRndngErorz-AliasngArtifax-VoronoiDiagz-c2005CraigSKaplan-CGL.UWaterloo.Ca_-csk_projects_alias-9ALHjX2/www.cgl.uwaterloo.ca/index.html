        The Computer Graphics Lab of the <A
        HREF="http://www.uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo </A> concentrates
        on research in curve and surface design, rendering, perception, and
        user interfaces. The CGL is characterized by its eclectic approach to
        computer graphics and user interface research, which in turn has
        spawned a creative and dynamic environment. This interdisciplinary
        nature, as illustrated by the CGL's relationship with the UW Psychology
        Department, has enriched the pursuit of topics such as the visual
        perception of displays and colour printing. Collaboration with the Fine
        Arts department has produced a series of animated shorts which have
        fostered an awareness of the need for synergy between artist and
        technician. This holistic direction of graphics research provides a
        rewarding environment for faculty member and student alike. <br><br>

        Weekly lab meetings help members keep abreast of current research, both
        internal and external.  They also provide a congenial atmosphere for us
        to discuss general lab happenings and events.  Consult our <a
        href="http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/Coming.html">coming
        agenda</a> for more information. <br><br>

        CGL is located in the Davis Centre, at DC 2303.<br><br>

      <b>CGL's Professor Research Snapshots</b>
      <br><br>

      <b>Steve</b>'s interests are in the area of modeling surfaces. He is also
      interested in Geometric Algebra, and he works on surface modeling in
      numerical control machining (NC-machining). 
      <br><br>

      <b>Bill</b>'s research is in interactive computer graphics. Specifically
      he is interested in the interface between the user's perceptual systems
      and the streams of information provided by a computer, particularly as it
      is constrained by limited attention. Colour has always been a focus of
      his research. 
      <br><br>

      <b>Craig</b> studies the application of computer graphics in art,
      illustration, ornamentation, and design. Topics explored by Craig in the
      past include: the art of M.C. Escher; the mathematical structure and
      generation of Islamic geometric patterns; black-and-white line art,
      especially mazes and labyrinths; traditional Chinese and European
      papercutting; and graphic design based on calligraphy.
      <br><br>

      <b>Mike</b>'s research interests are in the area of real-time graphics,
      high performance computing, and programming platforms for many-core
      processors.
