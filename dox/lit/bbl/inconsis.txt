     old and under. (Note: John the Baptist, Jesus' cousin, though under two is
     somehow spared.)

   * EP 2:13-15, HE 7:18-19 Jesus did abolish the law.

   * MT 5:22 Anyone who calls another a fool is liable to Hell.
   * MT 7:26 Jesus says that anyone who hears his words and does not do them is
     a fool. (Note: The translation now prevalent, "like a foolish man," in MT
     7:26 is a dishonest attempt to alleviate the obvious inconsistency here in
     that the oldest Greek manuscripts use the same Greek word translated
     "fool" in MT 5:22 and "like a foolish man" in MT 7:26.)
   * MT 23:17-19 Jesus twice calls the Pharisees blind fools.
   * MT 25:2, 3, 8 Jesus likens the maidens who took no oil to fools. (Note:
     Again, this is the same Greek word translated "fool" in MT 5:22 and MT
     23:17-19.) 1CO 1:23, 3:18, 4:10 Paul uses fool with regard to Christians
     becoming fools for Christ. (Note: Again, this is the same Greek word
     translated "fool" in MT 5:22 and MT 23:17-19.)

   * MT 10:28, LK 12:4 Jesus says not to fear men. (Fear God only.)
   * MT 12:15-16, JN 7:1-10, 8:59, 10:39, 11:53-54 Jesus hid, escaped, went
     secretly, etc.

   * MT 11:7-15, 17:12-13 Jesus says that John the Baptist was a prophet, and
     more.
   * JN 1:21 John himself says that he is not a prophet, nor is he Elijah.

   * MT 11:25, MK 4:11-12 Jesus thanks God for hiding some things from the wise
     while revealing them to "babes." He says that he uses parables so that the
     meaning of some of his teachings will remain hidden to at least some
     persons, and specifically so that they will not turn and be forgiven.
   * MK 4:22 Jesus says that all things should be made known.
   * STRONG>MT 11:29 Jesus says that he is gentle (meek) and humble (lowly).
   * JN 2:15 Jesus makes a whip of cords, drives the money changers from the
     Temple, overturns their tables, and pours out their coins. (Note: The
     presence of the money changers in the outer court of the Temple had been
     authorized by the Temple authorities and was, in fact, a necessity since
     the Jews would not accept Roman coin for the purchase of sacrifices.)

   * MT 12:5 Jesus says that the law (the OT) states that the priests profane
     the Sabbath but are blameless. (No such statement is found in the OT.)

   * MT 12:30 Jesus says that those who are not with him are against him.
   * MK 9:40 Jesus says that those who are not against him are for him. (Note:
     This puts those who are indifferent or undecided in the "for him" category
     in the first instance and in the "against him" category in the second
     instance.)

   * MT 12:39, MK 8:12, LK 11:29 Jesus says that he will give no "sign."
   * JN 3:2, 20:30, AC 2:22 Jesus proceeds to give many such "signs."

   * MT 13:34, MK 4:34 Jesus addresses the crowds only in parables, so that
     they would not fully understand. He explains the meaning only to his
     disciples.
   * JN 1:1 - 21:25 (Throughout the book of John, unlike the other Gospels,
     Jesus addresses the crowds in a very straightforward manner. He does not
     employ parables.)

   * MT 13:58, MK 6:5 In spite of his faith, Jesus is not able to perform
     mighty miracles.
   * MT 17:20, 19:26, MK 9:23, 10:27, LK 17:6, 18:27 Jesus says that anything
     is possible to him who believes if he has the faith of a grain of mustard
     seed. All things are possible with God. A mountain can be commanded to
     move and it will move.

   * MT 5:37, 15:19, MK 7:22, JN 8:14, 44, 14:6, 18:37 Jesus says that you
     should answer a plain "yes" or "no," that his purpose is to bear witness
     to the truth, and that his testimony is true. He equates lying with evil.
   * JN 7:2-10 Jesus tells his brothers that he is not going to Jerusalem for
     the Feast of the Tabernacles, then later goes secretly by himself. (Note:
     The words "not yet" were added to some versions at JN 7:8 in order to
     alleviate this problem. The context at JN 7:10 makes the deception clear,
     however.)

   * MK 15:42-16:8, LK 23:50-56, JN 19:38-42 (No guard is mentioned. This is
     important since rumor had it that Jesus' body was stolen and the

   * MK 16:1-3, LK 24:1 (There could not have been a guard, as far as the women
     were concerned, since they were planning to enter the tomb with spices.

     that heard the story was one of belief since they followed the revealed
     instructions.
   * MK 16:11, LK 24:11 The initial reaction was one of disbelief. All doubted.

   * MT 28:1-18 The order of Resurrection appearances was: Mary Magdalene and
     the other Mary, then the eleven.
   * MK 16:9-14 It was Mary Magdalene, then two others, then the eleven.
   * LK 24:15-36 It was two, then Simon (Peter?), then the eleven.

   * AC 13:39, CN 2:13, 1JN 1:9 All sins are forgivable.

   * MK 4:11-12, 11:25 Jesus says that he uses parables so that the meaning of
     some of his teachings will remain secret to at least some persons. He
     explains the meanings of the parables only to his disciples. He thanks God
     for hiding some things from the wise while revealing them to "babes."
   * JN 18:20 Jesus says that he always taught openly, never secretly.

   * MK 6:16 Herod was the source of the belief that John had been raised from
     the dead.
   * LK 9:7 Others were the source. Herod was perplexed by the belief.

   * MK 6:52 The people were so unimpressed with "the Feeding of the Multitude"
     that they did not even understand the event.
   * JN 6:14-15 They were so impressed that they tried to force Jesus to be

     Jerusalem).
   * AC 1:9-12 It took place outdoors, after 40+ days, at Mt. Olivet. (MT
     28:16-20 No mention is made of an ascension, but if it took place at all,
     it must have been from a mountain in Galilee since MT ends there.)
