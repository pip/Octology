<center><h3><font color="#8040F0"> The Seven Noachide Categories </font></h3>
        <h4>(blatantly inadequate) negative concept summary words:<br />
            murder, theft, sex, animals, idolatry, cursing, courts</h4>
        <h4>behavior resulting from insufficient respect for:<br />
            life, property, sex, animals, worship, speech, justice</h4>
</center>

<p> 1. Murder is forbidden: The life of a human being, formed in G-d's image, is sacred.

<p> 2. Theft is forbidden. The world is not ours to do with as we please.

<p> 3. Incestuous and adulterous relations are forbidden. Human beings are not sexual objects, nor is pleasure the ultimate goal of life.

<p> 4. Eating the flesh of a living animal is forbidden. This teaches us to be sensitive towards animals. (This was commanded to Noah for the first time along
with the permission of eating meat. The negative laws were enforced at the Garden of Eden.)

<p> 5. Idolatry is forbidden: Mankind is commanded to believe in the One G-d alone and worship only G-d.

<p> 6. Cursing the name of G-d is forbidden. Besides honoring and respecting G-d, we learn from this precept that our speech must be sanctified, as that is
the distinctive sign which separated humans from the animals.

<p> 7. Mankind is commanded to establish courts of justice and a just social order to enforce the first six laws and enact any other useful laws or customs.

<br /><br /><b>Specific References</b>

<p> These categories are felt to be implicit in G-d's commandment to Adam and Eve in Genesis (Bereshis) 2:16-17.

<p> 1. The following verse is a reference to the prohibition against murder. G-d explicitly commands Noah (Genesis 9:6), "If one sheds the blood of the man
(HaAdam), by man shall his own blood be shed."<br />

2. The following is an implicit reference to the prohibition against theft. It shows that permission is needed to take something that is not explicitly yours.
"You shall not steal; you shall not deal deceitfully or falsely with one another" (Leviticus 19:11).<br />

3. The below verse refers to sexual misconduct or adultery, as the prophet Jeremiah (3:1) says, "Saying (laymor), if a man divorces his wife..."<br />

4. The following verse implies that there are things which may not be eaten (the limbs of a live animal): "You must not, however, eat flesh with its
life-blood in it." (Genesis 9:4)<br />

5. The following verse is a reference to the prohibition against idolatry; for it says in Exodus 20:3, "You shall have no other gods before me."<br />

6. The following verse implies the prohibition against blasphemy. As it says in Leviticus 24:16, "He who blasphemes the name of the Lord (Hashem) shall
die."<br />

7. What follows is a reference to laws of justice for it says in Genesis 18:19, "For I have known him so he will command (Yitzaveh) his children after him to
keep the way of the Lord and righteousness and justice."<br />
