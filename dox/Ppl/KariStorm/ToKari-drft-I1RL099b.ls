Hello Kari,

Thank you for your warm response and candor. I'm not intending to come off as too forward, but I finding you as instantly endearing in many ways. Sweet.

You're intuition about me consistently being identified as like a hippy is quite correct. I'm not much of a marijuana smoker anymore, but I typically maintain a predominantly laid-back demeanor, usually easy-going (as long as conditions don't demand another attitude), so I can resemble 1970's styles or stereotypes that way too. Maybe my uncut hair and beard contribute much there too. I may have been compared more with depictions of Y'shua (Jesus) than I have with hippies. I have received lots of both of those, usually conveyed hopefully fairly while more mentions seemed favorable than those likely meant to be disparaging. I do want there to be more periods of better peace on earth and would rather "make love, not war", hippy-like. I'd really like to become more similar to a Messiah to help diminish pain, suffering, and death throughout space and time, Y'shua-like. Even if I only ever significantly diminish my own suffering and hopefully save myself from death whenever finding things dire again, I think my general desires and hopes to learn how to benefit all of life in those ways feels honorable, even if I exhibit some deluded or grandiose thinking to dream I could achieve success of past some point having more in common with the Messiah than remains to indicate my commonality with hippies or any other relatively normal human individual...
