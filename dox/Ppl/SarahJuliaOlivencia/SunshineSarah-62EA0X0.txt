For me too!  Thanks for your number.  Are there regular times when I
shouldn't call you because you're in meetings or occupied otherwise?

You're welcome.  I don't want to disturb your focus but hopefully you
can prove to yourself and your sponsor that you can remain sober even if
we stay in touch every few days.  I don't think I've ever been a bad
influence on you but there is a bit of potential now since I don't have
an apparent abuse problem so I might not be able to understand or
support yours as effectively as you need.  I don't want my resentment of
authority to harm you so let's do whatever is best.  A big hug... (it's
a long hug too) and a kiss.

>    Sweet dreams handsome!
I hope you had sweet dreams as well.

>    Love,
Love,

p.s.  I know it's kinda cheesy but I meant what I've been saying that I
only want to be with a dramatically different person than the Jewlz who
I have already known, so I intend to keep calling your better side
Sarah... sober, sweet, sunshine-seeking Sarah.  For an extra helping of
cheese: Happy Valentine's Day my love.  I want nothing more than for you
to succeed in your transformation and, even though I'm usually resentful
of holidays for all the silliness they get saddled with, I'd like to
give you this rose today as a reminder of our love:  @}-,-'-,----

p.p.s.  I've sent you an invitation to Gmail (which seems significantly
better than Yahoo mail to me).  Maybe you can get a new 'SunnySarah'
account or something similar.  I think your new course is going to take
a lot more concentration and vibrant appreciation than your old luck.

I'd recommend trying:
  SunnySarah
  SweetSarah
  SuperSarah
  SunshineSarah
  HappySarah
  SarahO
  SarahOlivencia

Maybe you could talk to your sponsor about my desire to call the new
sober you exclusively Sarah and to leave luck and Jewlz behind for now.
Thanks.  I have another IGDA meeting in SF tonight (like the dragons one
that you came to) but I'll try to call you after I get home.  I'd like
to chat again tonight if possible.
