Hello Sarah,

I'm glad you have received my letter.  I would like to clarify a bit on
the topic I may have rushed through at the end.

As long as you have permanently stopped running back to Char, remain
clean and sober, and are involved in regular counceling, I am eager to
be your friend and to chat periodically while we each focus and work on
ourselves during this time where we have space and preparedness
between us.

Once June has arrived, if you have accomplished all six of the goals I
have written you and you feel confident enough in your accomplishments
of your own goals... whatever else you may have set for yourself by that
time, then I will be glad to consider getting back together if that
makes sense to both of us at that time.

The "don't sleep with anyone else" part is a little tougher.  I
shouldn't have written that.  I mean, we're not together for now so of
course you should do whatever you want, as will I.  The thing is, the
"whatever I want" is for both of us to not sleep with anyone else and
to get back together in June and be better than ever.  So I don't want
to sleep with anyone else before June and I hope you don't want (and
haven't had) anyone else either.  If you have had sex with anyone since
me, I would rather not get back together... even if we do become close
friends again.  For all the reassurance that you gave me that you have
been trustworthy, faithful, and that you didn't want to hurt me, you
messed things up so badly, so often, and you wound up back with Char.  I
believed you before that, even though you were staying with Char, you
were not sleeping with him.  Then he went crazy on you and your stuff
and I gave you another chance and then you ran back to him again right
afterwards.  Even if you work on all the other things (and I don't mean
to belittle any of them), what matters most to me are the higher
concepts of honesty, integrity, loyalty, and respect.  Everything else
(e.g., not living/fighting with Char, staying sober, having and
accomplishing your own goals, etc.) should flow directly from them.
Does that make sense?

I just want us to someday love each other gently and properly... without
constant avoidable violence and destruction.  I need an honorable woman
and you have not been but I still hope you will become.  How is your
focus?

Love,
-Pip

p.s.  Do you have a new phone number?  Please call me.  I long to hear
your voice.
