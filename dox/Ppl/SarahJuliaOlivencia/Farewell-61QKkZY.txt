>    Yes Pip, you are very honorable!  The address fits you well:)
Thanks.  I know. =)  I guess that means I'm not the most humble.
>    Were you trying to make a point by using that address??
A little.  It was also just convenient to copy your section of my
address book over to LBox.

You're welcome.  Good luck with the trial.

I'm sorry to report that it would be hard for me to care less.  I am
busy with work and moving on from you and your habitual destruction.
Your episode last week has rendered you unwelcome in my home and,
after further consideration, I have realized that I don't want to see
you or know who you are today any longer.

Please don't call me or contact me at all until you've become a
fundamentally different person.  Some examples of qualifying
fundamental differences are:

  * no longer living and fighting with ex-boyfriends
  * no longer using/abusing speed, alcohol, or cigarettes
  * regular attendance of anger-management and grief counceling
  * a stable career or educational curriculum
  * reliable transportation
  * constant consideration and respect for yourself, others, animals,
    property, etc.

Once again, I'm not requiring you to change.  You should just be
yourself and do whatever you want but I'm clear that I don't want to be
around who you are now.  Please don't contact me again before this
summer is well underway.  I need time and space to focus on my future
and I will most likely be happier and more successful at accomplishing
my goals and dreams if you are not in it.

>    Hope you have a good day and talk to you soon.
Thanks.  I hope you have a good day too and that we don't talk soon.  I
need to spend my time cultivating relationships that are worthwhile and
ours no longer is.

>    Love,
Farewell,

p.s. I seriously asked you not to contact me for at least two weeks and
you have called me twice in the five (5) days since then.  Please do
better at leaving me alone this time.  I'm not interested in you
anymore.  Please go do your own thing from now on and stay away from me
and everyone I care about.  I want our relationship to be entirely over
for at least six (6) months.  Wasting any further effort on you is not
productive for me; it is thoroughly destructive.  Please respect my
wishes and allow me to devote my time and attention to other people and
things going forward.

61TCW8C - some further thoughts:

You called me twice (both times asking if I had been responsible to
keep track of something important to you that you had lost, namely a
critical entry from your phonebook and the whereabouts of your truck's
rim lug-nuts) and you e-mailed me the above reply all within five (5)
days after I asked to be left alone.  That's three (3) unwanted
contacts in just over one third (1/3) the time I asked to be
undisturbed.  This pushed me over the edge that my reaction was to
lay down an even more rigid and lasting boundary with you.  I can't
afford to overestimate you again.  I have lost a lot to you.  Anyone
and anything else I devote my time and attention to is more deserving
and more appreciative.  Begone from me you wicked and devastating
woman!  It's unfortunate (unlucky?) that I am better off alone.
