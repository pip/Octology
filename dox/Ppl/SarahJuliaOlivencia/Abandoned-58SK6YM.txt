Hello Julia,

I'm not trying to blow this out of proportion... but that fact that I'm
compelled to write this should be a visible && emotional signal to you
that I am disturbed and need you to please read this with care.

I can and am glad to forgive you for what you have done but I first
need you to acknowledge && appreciate why I'm bent out of shape so that
your apology (if you choose to give one after reading) can hold weight
&& so that you can have adequate opportunity to be less likely to let
me down in similar or more serious ways in the future.

I also want you to know that I'm not trying to be overly dramatic by
typing this message out rather than carrying a verbal conversation...
it's just that I can premeditate what I wish to say this way.  I relish
expressive writing.  I also have melodramatic tendencies so I sometimes
come off more severe than is warranted.  Please bear all that in mind as
you continue to read the substance of this letter.

You have let me down in several key ways that I would like you to agree
to try harder to avoid next time or to at least think about && explain
why you don't think it's a problem or why I shouldn't be so uptight.

In the future, I would like to you please make an effort to:
  a) better follow through with what you have said you will do
  b) be more considerate than you were last night
  c) be more resourceful than you were last night
Details of how I think you could accomplish these && why follow.

Let's first recap my perspective on last night's relevant events:

  0) The truck keys were lost.
  1) I dropped you at work (&& you gave me a delicious dinner which was
       wonderful.  Thanks again!).
  2) I got to work && had both the Civic && truck at my office.  I
       searched for the truck keys (with no luck) for about two minutes
       before I rushed into my office to use the bathroom.  I worked
       diligently.
  3) You called many times while I was working because you were
       coordinating a visit with Meghan.  The visit turned out not to
       be necessary in the sense of an emergency or anything but just
       something both she && you strongly desired for social reasons.
  4) I answered all of your calls, agreed to finish up my work, pick
       you up at Bloom's, && to visit Meghan with you.  At this point,
       I had informed you that my cellular battery was dying.
  5) Upon leaving my office, I searched the Civic more thoroughly &&
       found the truck keys.  I called you in hopes that you could get
       a ride to my office so that we could go home with both vehicles.
       You did not answer so I left for Bloom's.
  6) When I was approaching the intersection of 101N && 80E, you
       noticed I had called and so you called me back.  You gave
       rotten directions && my cell died.  I went the wrong way down a
       one-way street next to the police department (which was
       frustrating && a little scary).  I found Bloom's rather easily
       after all that.
  7) I was getting tired but I met your friends (John, Gene [Charlie's
       cousin], Iliana [Was that her name?], Bill, && Gene [the
       bartender].  It was also nice to see Lisa again.  She's very
       friendly && kind.
  8) You needed your truck so I began driving us back to my office.  My
       side started throbbing in pain && I was getting more tired while
       driving.  You gave me frustrating directions like "maybe you want
       to turn right at this next light... if you feel like it" just to
       get us on the 101S && you led us the wrong way first.  I was
       exhausted by the time we got to my office.  We discussed options.
  9) The plan (as I understood it) was:
     a) Leave the Civic at my office.
     b) You drive us (in the truck) to your house while I sleep.
     c) You said I could also sleep a few hours at your house before...
     d) We would leave to visit Meghan in Humboldt.
     e) We would return early (i.e., during the afternoon or evening) in
          order to assure we both could be well-rested before returning
          to work Monday.
     f) You'd drop me at work Monday morning where I'd have the Civic.
     I confirmed that we would not need the Civic at all the rest of the
       weekend because we would stick to the above plan && you agreed.
     The plan went smoothly until d).
 10) When we got to your house, you said you would charge my phone.  I
       said maybe I should go home to get my wall charger (which I
       explained is my preference) but you confirmed that you would
       either find your old wall charger or use your car charger in the
       truck to charge my phone while I slept.  I think you joked that
       my phone could ride in the truck all week to fully charge.
 11) You also confirmed you'd wake me up in a few hours to go with you.
 12) You failed to charge my phone && you failed to wake me up.
 13) You wrote me a note && left (with Andrea) for Humboldt where your
       cell gets no reception.
 14) I awoke stranded at your house with no cell and no vehicle.
 15) A few hours later, Greg happened to stop by and was kind enough to
       give me a ride home before I had to walk or call a cab from your
       house phone.

If you say you'll charge my cell phone && wake me up, please do so.
Follow through with what you say you will do.  You've also said you'd
repair my rear-view mirror && install a sound system in the Civic
last week then again this weekend but you have not done so (excusably
because you were called into work but it still deserves mention since I
haven't returned your truck in worse condition than I borrowed it).
You also said we'd return from Humboldt early so that we could get
plenty of sleep before both needing to return to work on Monday &&
(although I'm not with you && sleep is less of an immediate concern for
you) it is now after midnight && it appears you are still there since
your cell phone still has no reception.  You're letting everything fall
apart if you don't return && take me to work in the morning as we had
planned.  Please do what you say or don't say you will do.

Now you also know that I'm wounded && still recovering from my accident.
I still need substantial amounts of recuperative sleep.  I wish I was
fully healed already && devoid of pain but my body needs more time.  I
worked hard && was tired && frustrated last night && then woke up
stranded.  I'm writing this because it all leaves a bitter taste in my
mouth.  I'd like you to be more considerate about these things.

You tried to wake me up before you decided to leave without me.  I
vaguely remember you touching my back for a minute but I was too deep
asleep && the touching was too relaxing to wake me enough to even open
my eyes.  In spite of how much I still need rejuvenative sleep (as
mentioned above), I can't imagine I would be impossible to wake up if
you kept saying my name (loudly if necessary).  I'm glad you didn't
shake me violently (for the risk of aggravating my remaining wounds) but
there remain other good options...  like putting an alarm clock or
either of our cell phones near me && making them go off.  This would be
resourcefulness.

I've said (&& still confirm) that I like you && love you the way you
are.  You don't have to change for me.  I'm just writing all of this to
give you an opportunity to vividly understand how you let me down last
night.  We influence && impact each other profoundly the closer we get
&& the more we depend upon the other.  I want you to understand that I
trusted you last night beyond your trustworthiness.  My natural
response is to recoil... to trust you less next time.  I'm not writing
all this to make you feel bad.  Rather, I'm telling you because I care
enough that I want to give you at least enough (if not too much)
information so that you can choose to improve next time && build my
trust back.  I would appreciate this not happening again && hope I don't
ever leave you stranded as you did me.

Here's the (potentially) harshest part:  I don't need you.
I have chosen to be with you, to care about you, to share my life with
you for now, to depend on you, && to love you.  I love && care about
myself more than I love && care about you.  I'm sorry if this sounds
like a threat but it is a truth that I am comfortable with && I'd like
you to digest it too.  I can && will choose to be apart from you (even
though I may still love && care about you) if you consistently
encourage me to depend on you only to abandon me (or leave me
"high && dry" in your words).  I can't be eager to be burned repeatedly.
Please tell me whenever you know I am (or think I might be) depending on
you more than you are capable or willing to uphold.  I will do the same.

I know you have many other friendships, relationships, &&
responsibilities to keep && maintain.  I'm glad about that.  Meghan
just called me to say she "needed" you && she's mad that I made you
leave her upset.  Nobody has told me any details about why she "needed"
you or what's going on there but that's fine... I guess I would be told
if I should know.  She says I shouldn't fucking break you down because
you are a good girl && you're dependable && I have no right to say I
can't depend on you.  She says that you're obviously wonderful because
you're driving back here in the middle of the night to keep your word to
take me to work in the morning because that's my highest priority
(snidely implying that I care about work more than your feelings or
something).  I'm glad your friend wants to stick up for you && explain
or justify whatever... but I have to admit she's hurting your case a
bit.  I'm sure you && her are great friends && are too far apart all the
time.  I'm glad you two could be together today && wish I could have
gone along under decent circumstances.  You two probably "need" to spend
even more time together soon.  I just don't appreciate being abandoned
when I think there are many superior alternatives.  Meghan claims that I
let you down by being too hard to wake up.  In a backwards sense, that
is true.  I don't appreciate arguments like that.  If I was totally
healthy && not needing copious amounts of sleep && was just being a
jackass saying "Fuck off!" when you were trying to wake me up... she
would be right.  Since none of that is the case, the failure remains
yours && you will own up to it if you care about accountability &&
resolution.  Maybe she doesn't know any details either && would like to
try to help && get involved && make any argument whatsoever.  I would
not advise that if her goal is harmony.  You might wish to clarify some
things with her before she && I meet in person (if we ever do).  You may
even wish to e-mail this letter to her.  I have no problem with that
since I have nothing to hide from anyone other than governmental
authority.  Even when I am culpable, I will stand up to my consequences.

Please carefully consider everything I have written above.  Also
remember that the issue (i.e., the topic of general trustworthiness &&
dependability) itself is much larger than the details && events that
brought it up.  You didn't leave me when I was in danger, in need of
medical help, when I had to get to work (yet), or anything serious.
Even if I had to walk a few miles home, I could get over it quickly.  It
was just a weekend day when I didn't have to do much more than sleep
anyway so I'm not totally pissed or anything.  In fact, those very
circumstances are precisely what enabled me to think intensely about the
issue all day && to have enough time to write this letter in response &&
hopes of resolution.  I want our relationship to be as strong && healthy
as possible so hopefully we can deal with things like this in a calm,
clear, effective, && loving way.  It takes attention && work to
cultivate a stable romance.  We have both done a good job so far.  Maybe
next time I'll be the one letting you down (I don't at all mean that I
would do so intentionally though!) && we'll have the reciprocal
discussion.  I think neither one of us want to hide our feelings or
concerns from the other... which includes irritation, disappointment,
insecurity, jealousy, && many other negative emotions.  Let's address &&
heal our wounds together.

Please tell Meghan to think more carefully before coming at me like
something is my fault when it is not.  Ignorant argument will only
aggravate everyone since it tries my patience.  I've been pretty
irritated all day && it was difficult not to go off on your friend when
she calls me && wakes me up to talk shit about how I let you down.  Fuck
that.  We can discuss any of this further if you want to.

Thanks for reading.

Love,
-Pip

p.s. I'm not giving this to you but Mike will still stick it in
Meghan's butt if she calls me to talk shit again.
