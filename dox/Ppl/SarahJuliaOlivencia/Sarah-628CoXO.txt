Dear Sarah,      Wed. Feb. 8, 2006

  I want to pour my heart out
to you because I so love you
and miss you (or at least your
good side) but maybe it's best
to keep this short so I'm going
to try.

  I fell in love with your
sweet side and the hope that
you would favor and strengthen
those traits.  I have wanted to
always be with the loving gentle
girl who wants her back touched,
to sleep with me and her stuffy,
and who loves to be woken up
beautifully and delicately by
me and the sunshine.  I gave you
every chance I could for you
to stay as her.  I had to
care less and less for my own
sake when you kept saying you
were going to change but things
stayed the same or got worse.
I was clear: I can't and don't
want to be around the old abusive
Jewlz.  I wrote six fundamental
changes I'd like to see.  I sadly
expected it would take you six
months to accomplish one of them
so when you wrote "I am getting my
life in tip top shaoe." I fully expected
it to be another lie that you thought
I wanted to hear, but once again
with no meaningful action behind

-- pg 2 --

it.  The two phone calls you
gave me after I asked for two
weeks alone were both about
whether I had been responsible
for something that mattered
to you (namely your phonebook
and your rim lug nuts).  Your
"tip top shaoe" e-mail afterwards
seemed like a bad joke and was
a third contact from you within
those five days after I asked
for two weeks.  It pissed me
off.  I could only imagine you
getting high and drunk and sleeping
with Char and spending counterfeit
money, blowing off your Trader
Joe's job and generally being
a low-life piece-of-shit while
claiming "tip-top shaoe" to me.
I didn't believe you and it's still
hard to imagine the Jewlz I have
known and been repeatedly hurt by,
actually changing herself.  It sounds
(if what you have e-mailed is true)
like you are already a new woman
in just two weeks.  You may have
already accomplished half of
the six goals I had for you
and you definitely will knock
them all out of the park if you
stay on the path you have described.
I'm done caring about fucked up old Jewlz
but I definitely want to be friends with this
awesome new Sarah who has her own goals
and makes good decisions to accomplish them.
As long as three of the six goals I
made for you are done, Sarah should feel
free to e-mail or call me whenever she
wants.  I'm proud of you.  I love you.
Stay focused.  Don't sleep with anyone else.  I'll
see you in June and I hope to talk often.  Be good.

                           Love,
                                -Pip
