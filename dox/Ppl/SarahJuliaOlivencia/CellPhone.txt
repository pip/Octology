61MG0sP - Jewlz cellular phone with Verizon Wireless is:
  Phone  #: (510)672-5254
  Account#: 470552098-00001
  Invoice#: 2005767875 billed 5CP (December 25, 2005) w/ $295.46 due by 61K (January 20, 2006) paid 61M (January 22, 2006)
61N1ueQ - I called Torrey and transferred Jewlz' contract to a family plan with my phone on it where there are 700 minutes at $60 / month (instead of my old
  800 mins @ $70 / mo.).  He also put her phone on hold for 30 or 60 days and canceled her old serial number.  If he finds a used phone that will work, he
  said he'll call me so that I can re-activate her old number and just have two phones.
