            <P class=3Ddescender>Late one afternoon in June, 2001, John =
W. Worley=20
            sat in a burgundy leather desk chair reading his e-mail. He =
was=20
            fifty-seven and burly, with glasses, a fringe of =
salt-and-pepper=20
            hair, and a bushy gray beard. A decorated Vietnam veteran =
and an=20
            ordained minister, he had a busy practice as a Christian=20
            psychotherapist, and, with his wife, Barbara, was the =
caretaker of a=20
            mansion on a historic estate in Groton, Massachusetts. He =
lived in a=20
            comfortable three-bedroom suite in the mansion, and saw =
patients in=20
            a ground-floor office with walls adorned with images of =
Jesus and=20
            framed military medals. Barbara had been his high-school=20
            sweetheart=97he was the president of his class, and she was =
the=20
            homecoming queen=97and they had four daughters and seven=20
            grandchildren, whose photos surrounded Worley at his =
desk.</P>
            <P>Worley scrolled through his in-box and opened an e-mail,=20
            addressed to =93CEO/Owner.=94 The writer said that his name =
was Captain=20
            Joshua Mbote, and he offered an awkwardly phrased =
proposition: =93With=20
            regards to your trustworthiness and reliability, I decided =
to seek=20
            your assistance in transferring some money out of South =
Africa into=20
            your country, for onward dispatch and investment.=94 Mbote =
explained=20
            that he had been chief of security for the Congolese =
President=20
            Laurent Kabila, who had secretly sent him to South Africa to =
buy=20
            weapons for a force of =E9lite bodyguards. But Kabila had =
been=20
            assassinated before Mbote could complete the mission. =93I =
quickly=20
            decided to stop all negotiations and divert the funds to my =
personal=20
            use, as it was a golden opportunity, and I could not return =
to my=20
            country due to my loyalty to the government of Laurent =
Kabila,=94=20
            Mbote wrote. Now Mbote had fifty-five million American =
dollars, in=20
            cash, and he needed a discreet partner with an overseas bank =

            account. That partner, of course, would be richly =
rewarded.</P>
            <P>Mbote=92s offer had the hallmarks of an advance-fee =
fraud, a=20
            swindle whose victims are asked to provide money, =
information, or=20
            services in exchange for a share of a promised fortune. =
Countless=20
            such e-mails, letters, and faxes are sent every year, with a =
broad=20
            variety of stories about how the money supposedly became =
available=20
            (unclaimed estate, corrupt executive, and dying Samaritan =
being only=20
            a few of the most popular). Worley, who had spent his adult =
life=20
            advocating self-knowledge and introspection, seemed =
particularly=20
            unlikely to be fooled. He had developed a psychological =
profiling=20
            tool designed to reveal a person=92s =93unique needs, =
desires and=20
            probable behavioral responses.=94 He promised users of the =
test, =93The=20
            individual=92s understanding of self will be greatly =
enhanced,=20
            increasing the potential for a fulfilled and balanced =
life.=94 And=20
            Worley was vigilant against temptation. Two weeks before the =
e-mail=20
            arrived, he had been the keynote speaker at his eldest=20
            granddaughter=92s graduation from the First Assembly =
Christian Academy=20
            in Worcester, Massachusetts. He cautioned the students about =
Satan,=20
            telling them, =93He=92s going to be trying to destroy you =
every inch of=20
            the way.=94 </P>
            <P>Still, Worley, faced with an e-mail that would, according =
to=20
            federal authorities, eventually lead him to join a gang of =
Nigerian=20
            criminals seeking to defraud U.S. banks, didn=92t hesitate. =
A few=20
            minutes after receiving Mbote=92s entreaty, he replied, =93I =
can help=20
            and I am interested.=94 His only question was how Mbote had =
found him,=20
            and he seemed satisfied with the explanation: that the South =
African=20
            Department of Home Affairs had supplied his name. When =
Worley=20
            attributed this improbable event to God=92s will, Mbote =
elaborated on=20
            the story to say that Worley=92s name was one of ten that he =
had been=20
            given, and that it had been pulled from a hat after much =
prayer by=20
            someone named Pastor Mark. (A more likely possibility is =
that his=20
            e-mail address was plucked from an Internet chain letter, =
which he=20
            received and passed on, that promised a cash reward from =
Microsoft=20
            to anyone who forwarded the letter to others.) In e-mails, =
phone=20
            calls, faxes, and letters during the ensuing weeks, Mbote =
laid out=20
            the plan: If Worley would pay up-front costs, such as fees =
to a=20
            storage facility where the cash was being kept, and possibly =
travel=20
            to South Africa to collect the money, he would receive =
thirty per=20
            cent, or more than sixteen million dollars. </P>
            <P>Worley told Mbote that he lived his life with the =
=93utmost=20
            integrity=94 and didn=92t want to jeopardize that. He also =
said that he=20
            couldn=92t fund the operation. (Though he would report =
nearly a=20
            hundred and forty thousand dollars in income in 2001, he had =

            declared personal bankruptcy in the early nineties, had =
relatively=20
            little saved for retirement, and wanted to help his =
grandchildren=20
            through college.) No problem, Mbote answered; =
=93investors=94 would=20
            provide up to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for =
airfare and=20
            other expenses needed to move the money to the United =
States, while=20
            Worley would act as middleman and curator of the funds.</P>
            <P>As promised, in late August, 2001, Worley received a =
check for=20
            forty-seven thousand five hundred dollars, purportedly from =
one such=20
            investor. It was from an account belonging to the Syms =
Corporation,=20
            the discount-clothing chain whose slogan is =93An Educated =
Consumer Is=20
            Our Best Customer.=94 Worley was wary. He called the Fleet =
Bank in=20
            Portland, Maine, where the check had been drawn. The bank =
told him=20
            it was an altered duplicate of a check that Syms had paid to =
the=20
            Maryland office of an international luggage manufacturer. =

            <P class=3Ddescender>Every swindle is driven by a desire for =
easy=20
            money; it=92s the one thing the swindler and the swindled =
have in=20
            common. Advance-fee fraud is an especially durable con. In =
an early=20
            variation, the Spanish Prisoner Letter, which dates to the =
sixteenth=20
            century, scammers wrote to English gentry and pleaded for =
help in=20
            freeing a fictitious wealthy countryman who was imprisoned =
in Spain.=20
            Today, the con usually relies on e-mail and is often called =
a 419=20
            scheme, after the anti-fraud section of the criminal code in =

            Nigeria, where it flourishes. (Last year, a Nigerian comic =
released=20
            a song that taunted Westerners with the lyrics =93I go chop =
your=20
            dollar. I go take your money and disappear. Four-one-nine is =
just a=20
            game. You are the loser and I am the winner.=94) The =
scammers, who=20
            often operate in crime rings, are known as =93yahoo-yahoo =
boys,=94=20
            because they frequently use free Yahoo accounts. Many of =
them live=20
            in a suburb of Lagos called Festac Town. Last year, one =
scammer in=20
            Festac Town told the Associated Press, =93Now I have three =
cars, I=20
            have two houses, and I=92m not looking for a job =
anymore.=94</P>
            <P>According to a statement posted on the Internet by the =
U.S. State=20
            Department, 419 schemes began to proliferate in the=20
            mid-nineteen-eighties, when a collapse in oil prices caused =
severe=20
            economic upheaval in Nigeria. The population=97literate,=20
            English-speaking, and living with widespread government=20
            corruption=97faced poverty and rising unemployment. These =
conditions=20
            created a culture of scammers, some of them violent. Marks =
are often=20
            encouraged to travel to Nigeria or to other countries, where =
they=20
            fall victim to kidnapping, extortion, and, in rare cases, =
murder. In=20
            the nineteen-nineties, at least fifteen foreign businessmen, =

            including one American, were killed after being lured to =
Nigeria by=20
            419 scammers. Until recently, Nigerian officials tended to =
blame the=20
            marks. =93There would be no 419 scam if there are no greedy, =
credulous=20
            and criminally-minded victims ready to reap where they did =
not sow,=94=20
            the Nigerian Embassy in Washington said in a 2003 statement. =
The=20
            following year, Nuhu Ribadu, the chairman of Nigeria=92s =
Economic=20
            &amp; Financial Crimes Commission, noted that not one =
scammer was=20
            behind bars. Last November, however, Ribadu=92s commission =
convicted=20
            two crime bosses who had enticed a Brazilian banker to spend =
two=20
            hundred and forty-two million dollars of his employer=92s =
money on a=20
            fictitious airport-development deal. (Prosecutions by U.S.=20
            authorities are rare; most victims don=92t know the real =
names of=20
            their =93partners,=94 and 419 swindlers are adept at =
covering their=20
            tracks.)</P>
            <P>Despite Nigeria=92s efforts, the schemes have reached =
=93epidemic=20
            proportions,=94 according to a publication by the U.S. =
Federal Trade=20
            Commission. The agency received more than fifty-five =
thousand=20
            complaints about them last year, nearly six times as many as =
in=20
            2001. The increase is due in part to the Internet, which =
makes it=20
            easy for scammers to reach potential marks in wealthier =
countries.=20
            =93If we educate the public to the point where nobody falls =
for it,=20
            then they=92ll go out of business,=94 Eric Zahren, a =
spokesman for the=20
            Secret Service, the lead U.S. agency in investigating =
advance-fee=20
            frauds, says. The agency estimates that 419 swindlers gross =
hundreds=20
            of millions of dollars a year, not including losses by =
victims too=20
            embarrassed to complain. In February, the son of a prominent =

            California psychiatrist named Louis A. Gottschalk=97he =
identified what=20
            turned out to be early signs of Alzheimer=92s in Ronald =
Reagan after=20
            analyzing his speech=97filed suit seeking to remove his =
father from=20
            control over a family partnership, claiming that Gottschalk =
had lost=20
            more than a million dollars to Nigerian scammers. Some =
victims try=20
            to pass along their losses. The former Iowa congressman =
Edward=20
            Mezvinsky, who had refashioned himself as an international=20
            businessman, was caught up in a 419 scam, and during the=20
            nineteen-nineties stole from his law clients, friends, and =
even his=20
            mother-in-law to cover his losses. He is serving more than =
six years=20
            in prison after pleading guilty to thirty-one counts of =
fraud.</P>
            <P>Robert B. Reich, the former Labor Secretary, who has =
studied the=20
            psychology of market behavior, says, =93American culture is =
uniquely=20
            prone to the =91too good to miss=92 fallacy. =
=91Opportunity=92 is our=20
            favorite word. What may seem reckless and feckless and =
hapless to=20
            people in many parts of the world seems a justifiable risk =
to=20
            Americans.=94 But appetite for risk is only part of it. A =
mark must be=20
            willing to pursue a fortune of questionable origin. The =
mind-set was=20
            best explained by the linguist David W. Maurer in his =
classic 1940=20
            book, =93The Big Con=94: =93As the lust for large and easy =
profits is=20
            fanned into a hot flame, the mark puts all his scruples =

            He closes out his bank account, liquidates his property, =

clients. In the=20

fact that=20
            he is the real victim, carefully selected and fatted for the =
kill.=20
            Thus arises the trite but none the less sage maxim: =91You =

earning=20
            decorations that included a Bronze Star. In 1976, after =
fifteen=20

received=20
            an honorable discharge and was later pardoned for his role =
in the=20
            robbery. He went to college and divinity school, and got a =

dedicated to=20
            helping others.</P>
            <P>In the early nineteen-nineties, Worley developed a =
sixty-item=20
            questionnaire that he called Worley=92s Identity Discovery =
Profile, or=20
            W.I.D.P., which sought to quantify a person=92s temperament =
in three=20
            areas: social and vocational, leadership, and relationships. =

            W.I.D.P. assigned labels to each: Introverted Sanguine, =

            <P class=3Ddescender>After the Syms check proved false and =
Mbote=20
            failed to send a replacement, Worley told him that their =
partnership=20
            was over. A few days later, though, he began receiving =
e-mails from=20
            someone claiming to be Mohammed Abacha, the eldest surviving =
son of=20
            Nigeria=92s late dictator General Sani Abacha, who reputedly =
stole=20
            billions from the Nigerian treasury. Mohammed Abacha told =
Worley=20
            that Joshua Mbote had been operating surreptitiously on the =
Abacha=20
            family=92s behalf, but had bungled so badly that Abacha =
decided to=20
            step forward. He told Worley that the story about buying =
weapons had=20
            been a ruse to protect the Abacha family and their money, =
which, he=20
            said, was actually hidden in Ghana. Soon Worley was put in =
touch=20
            with someone claiming to be the General=92s widow, Maryam =
Abacha. In a=20
            torrent of phone calls and e-mails, she appealed to Worley. =
=93I=20
            learned you wanted to hear from me,=94 she wrote. =93Here I =
am. Help=20
            me.=94 In his e-mails, Worley seemed invigorated by this new =
scenario;=20
            he apparently believed that he was on the verge of becoming =
rich=20
            while rescuing a woman in distress.</P>
            <P>In late November of 2001, Worley spent several thousand =
dollars=20
            on an attorney who specialized in international tax =
planning. The=20
            attorney warned him against the seeming opportunity, as did =
Barbara=20
            Worley. She knew little about her husband=92s =93project,=94 =
as he called=20
            it, but she didn=92t like it. Barbara lived a life that =
revolved, as=20
            she put it, =93around God and family.=94 In some ways, she =
still looked=20
            to her husband for guidance, as she had when they were in =
high=20
            school; she expressed her opinion, but deferred to his =
judgment.</P>
            <P>Worley dismissed these warnings; now that he had =
committed money=20
            to the partnership, he had a vested interest. By the end of =
2001, he=20
            was telling the Abachas that he had investigated ways to =
ship the=20
            cash secretly and had searched a half-dozen countries for a =
bank=20
            that would accept a huge deposit without alerting =
authorities. He=20
            reassured them that they had chosen the right partner, and =
begged=20
            for patience: =93I am a smart man and very cautious and do =
not want=20
            anything to go wrong.=94 He settled on the Bermuda-based =
Bank of=20
            Butterfield, and in late January, 2002, he told Mrs. Abacha =
that he=20
            had spent forty-three hundred dollars to open an account =
there.=20
            =93There will be no trail back to the U.S. and no tax to be =
paid,=94 he=20
            wrote.</P>
            <P>Worley=92s partners soon persuaded him to wire more than =
eight=20
            thousand dollars to retain a Nigerian lawyer and =93to cover =
the bank=20
            fees and late fees=94 that supposedly were the last barriers =
to the=20
            transfer. But, after more delays and growing doubts, Worley =
told=20
            them that he would not travel abroad=97the money, they said, =
had been=20
            moved to Amsterdam=97to collect the cash. They couldn=92t =
change his=20
            mind, so they tried a different approach. Mrs. Abacha asked =
him for=20
            help in claiming forty-five million dollars that she told =
him was=20
            hidden in an account of the Federal Ministry of Aviation at =
the=20
            Central Bank of Nigeria. It was a textbook 419 tactic. When =
Worley=20
            doubted Mbote, he disappeared; when Worley wouldn=92t travel =
for one=20
            treasure, they found another. He sent more money.</P>
            <P>Under this new plan, Worley allowed his partners to file =
false=20
            documentation claiming that he was a private aviation =
contractor to=20
            whom the Nigerian government owed forty-five million =
dollars. At the=20
            end of February, Worley crossed another line when a patient =
named=20
            Jennifer Morlock came to his home office for a counselling =
session.=20
            She had barely arrived when he told her he was engaged in a =
business=20
            venture with partners in Nigeria. Violating his =
profession=92s code of=20
            ethics, he asked to borrow fifteen thousand dollars. Morlock =
went=20
            home, spoke with her husband, and agreed. By noon, Worley =
was at her=20
            door to collect the money. The same day, he went to a nearby =
liquor=20
            store with a Western Union outlet and wired all fifteen =
thousand=20
            dollars to Nigeria. He soon repaid Morlock, with interest, =
by=20
            borrowing on his credit card. </P>
            <P>Meanwhile, Worley was growing more and more distressed. =

            <P class=3Ddescender>For five months, Worley didn=92t =
correspond with=20
            the Nigerians. Then, in September, 2002, a fax arrived from =
someone=20
            calling herself Mercy Nduka, who claimed to be a =
confidential=20
            secretary at the Central Bank of Nigeria. Nduka told Worley =
that the=20
            Aviation Ministry funds were still waiting for him, and that =
she was=20
            secretly working with the Abacha family. She said that they =

            who had the power to release the forty-five million; plus, =
she said,=20
            they needed another eighty-five thousand to cover fees. =
Worley=20
            refused to send more money, so Nduka and her boss, Usman =

behalf of the=20
            Abachas, with shares going to him, Nduka, and Bello for =
their=20
            services.</P>
            <P>Soon men who claimed to be investors began calling Worley =
from=20
            New York and Washington, asking him to provide credit =
references and=20
            requesting that he put up collateral for the loans they were =

            considering making to him. He refused to offer collateral, =
but that=20
            was never the point. The investors=92 questions and demands =
made him=20
            feel more secure, as though they were truly weighing whether =
to lend=20
            him money. In late November, 2002, Worley received a check =
for=20
            ninety-five thousand dollars, drawn on an account of the =
Robert Plan=20
            Corporation, a Long Island-based insurance company. Without=20
            verifying it, as he had done with the Syms check, he =
deposited it at=20
            a branch of Fleet Bank. In fact, the check was fraudulent, =
but a=20
            novice employee at the insurance company approved Fleet=92s =
payment=20
            inquiry. When the money appeared in Worley=92s account, =
Nduka told him=20
            to wire eighty-five thousand dollars to a bank in Latvia, =
which he=20
            did. He wired another thirty-eight hundred dollars when =
Bello said=20
            that he needed to buy a Rolex watch to bribe a bank =
official.=20
            Although the Robert Plan employee had approved the check and =
Fleet=20
            had paid it, Worley, according to federal law, was =
responsible for=20
            repayment. (If a fraudulent check is passed deliberately, a=20
            depositor can face felony charges.) About a month later, the =

            Nigerians sent Worley a check for some four hundred thousand =
dollars=20
            from a Michigan marketing company. This check was real, but =
it had=20
            been stolen and altered to make Worley the payee. When =
Worley=20
            deposited it at a branch of Citizens Bank near his home, it =
cleared;=20
            following Nduka=92s instructions, he wired the money to an =
account in=20
            a Swiss bank.</P>
            <P>In the meantime, the Nigerians had ensnared the wife of a =

            Mississippi car dealer, a woman named Marcia Cartwright. In =
October,=20
            2002, she had received a 419 e-mail from a man saying he was =

            desperate to get his money out of Nigeria. Two months later, =

            Cartwright received a check made out to her for nearly a =
hundred and=20
            nine thousand dollars, drawn on the account of a Texas =
advertising=20
            firm, and deposited it at the Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank =
of=20
            Booneville, Mississippi. It cleared, and, on orders from =
Nigeria,=20
            she sent Worley a cashier=92s check for a hundred and six =
thousand=20
            dollars, keeping the remainder for herself. He deposited the =
money=20
            in his Citizens account on January 15, 2003. The next day, =
he wired=20
            a hundred thousand dollars to the Swiss account.</P>
            <P>Worley told Nduka and Bello that he was certain they now =
had more=20
            than enough to bribe the bankers and cover other expenses. =
Nduka,=20
            ever polite, said that they were not quite there. She =
sympathized=20
            with his frustration, and Worley promised to be patient. She =

Cartwright=92s=20
            cashier=92s check=97to bribe the telex operators who would =

Finally,=20
            Nduka told him what he longed to hear: =93All is set for the =
final=20
            release of your fund.=94</P>
            <P>That day, the president of the Farmers &amp; Merchants =
Bank=20
            learned that the check Marcia Cartwright had deposited a =
month=20
            earlier had been returned as fraudulent. Bank officials =
called=20
            federal and state authorities, and Citizens Bank, where =
Worley had=20
            deposited Cartwright=92s cashier=92s check, was also =
notified. An=20
            investigator for Citizens, a former police lieutenant named =
Michael=20
            Raymond, told Worley what had happened and said that he was=20
            investigating potentially fraudulent activity. Worley sent =
frantic=20
            e-mails and made repeated calls to Nigeria, begging for a=20
            replacement check. Nduka answered with bad news: Bello had =
been=20
            attacked by robbers and was comatose. But, she wrote, =93I =
have=20
            reached an agreement with them for your fund to be released =
as=20
            planned on Friday.=94 All she needed was a thousand dollars =
to bribe=20
            another telex operator.</P>
            <P>Worley seemed on the verge of panicking. =93If you are my =

            with this $1,000? I have gone as far as I will go with this. =
I am=20
            desperate and have nothing else to say at this time. I am=20
            emotionally, spiritually, and financially drained.=94 Nduka =
answered=20
            humbly, calling herself =93an ordinary woman=94 who =
struggled on four=20
            hundred dollars a month. Worley responded that Nduka had =
=93touched my=20
            heart.=94 He wired the thousand dollars on January 30, =
2003.</P>
            <P>The next day, Raymond told Worley that the other check he =
had=20
            deposited at Citizens, the check from Michigan for four =
hundred=20
            thousand dollars, was also phony. Worley knew what that =
meant, and,=20
            according to Raymond, disclosed his suspicion that the =
Robert Plan=20
            check was probably fake, too. When Worley got off the phone =
with=20
            Raymond, he was enraged. =93I hate being taken advantage of =
by you=20
            evil bastards,=94 he wrote to Nduka. =93This is all lies?=94 =
He went on,=20
            =93Your day will come that you will be judged by God, and so =

            <P>Worley=92s lawyer, a former prosecutor named Thomas =

Citizens=20
            had approved payment on the checks, which, he said, =
reasonably led=20
            Worley to believe they were legitimate. He urged the jury to =
focus=20
            on the final thousand dollars that Worley had sent after he =
knew an=20
            investigation was under way=97this was evidence, he said, of =
Worley=92s=20
            gullibility. He likened Worley to Marcia Cartwright, whom =
the=20
            government viewed as a victim despite her also having passed =
a bad=20
            check. (Cartwright made partial restitution, testified for =
the=20
            prosecution, and was not charged.) Mostly, Hoopes urged the =
jury to=20
            view Worley=92s acts as foolish, not criminal. Hoopes =
emphasized that=20
            Worley had lost heavily in the scam. =93It=92s not willful =
blindness,=94=20
            Hoopes said. =93It is blind trust.=94</P>
            <P>In addition to witness testimony and lawyers=92 =
arguments, the jury=20
            was given hundreds of e-mails between Worley and the =
Nigerians which=20
            told a story of their own, about a man transformed by his =
pursuit of=20
            riches. Reading the e-mails, in which Worley displays both =
cunning=20
            and credulousness=97sometimes in the same message=97it is =
clear that the=20
            Nigerians were able to take advantage of his religious =
convictions,=20
            his stubbornness, and his desire to be a hero to Mrs. Abacha =
and to=20
            his family. Patiently and persistently, the Nigerians turned =

            Worley=92s skepticism into suspension of disbelief, to the =
point where=20
            he seemed to worry that they might not trust <SPAN=20

mark.</P>
            <P>The trial took six days, and the jury found Worley guilty =
on all=20
            counts. On February 15th, Worley, now sixty-two, returned to =
the=20
            federal courthouse at the edge of Boston Harbor to face =
sentencing.=20
            Accompanied by more than three dozen family members and =
friends, he=20
            arrived wearing a charcoal suit with a support-the-troops =
pin on the=20
            lapel. U.S. District Judge George O=92Toole, Jr., =
acknowledging the=20
            =93ordeal=94 that Worley had been through, said that he was =
nevertheless=20
            bound by the jury=92s finding. He sentenced Worley to two =
years in=20
            prison, plus restitution of nearly six hundred thousand =
dollars, and=20
            gave him five weeks to turn himself in. Outside the =
