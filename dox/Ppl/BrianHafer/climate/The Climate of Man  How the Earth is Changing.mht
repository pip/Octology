melting=20
          polar ice. How the earth is=20
        changing.</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The =
Alaskan=20
        village of Shishmaref sits on an island known as Sarichef, five =
miles=20
        off the coast of the Seward Peninsula. Sarichef is a small =
island - no=20
        more than a quarter of a mile across and two and a half miles =
long - and=20
        Shishmaref is basically the only thing on it. To the north is =
the=20
        Chukchi Sea, and in every other direction lies the Bering Land =
Bridge=20
        National Preserve, which probably ranks as one of the least =
visited=20
        national parks in the country. During the last ice age, the land =
bridge=20
        - exposed by a drop in sea levels of more than three hundred =
feet - grew=20
        to be nearly a thousand miles wide. The preserve occupies that =
part of=20
        it which, after more than ten thousand years of warmth, still =
remains=20
        above water.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shishmaref (pop. 591) is an Inupiat =
village,=20
        and it has been inhabited, at least on a seasonal basis, for =
several=20
        centuries. As in many native villages in Alaska, life there =
combines -=20
        often disconcertingly - the very ancient and the totally modern. =
Almost=20
        everyone in Shishmaref still lives off subsistence hunting, =
primarily=20
        for bearded seals but also for walrus, moose, rabbit, and =
migrating=20
        birds. When I visited the village one day last April, the spring =
thaw=20
        was under way, and the seal-hunting season was about to begin.=20
        (Wandering around, I almost tripped over the remnants of the =
previous=20
        year's catch emerging from storage under the snow.) At noon, the =

        village's transportation planner, Tony Weyiouanna, invited me to =
his=20
        house for lunch. In the living room, an enormous television set =
tuned to=20
        the local public-access station was playing a rock soundtrack. =
Messages=20
        like "Happy Birthday to the following elders . . ." kept =
scrolling=20
        across the screen.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, the men in Shishmaref =
hunted=20
        for seals by driving out over the sea ice with dogsleds or, more =

        recently, on snowmobiles. After they hauled the seals back to =
the=20
        village, the women would skin and cure them, a process that =
takes=20
        several weeks. In the early nineteen-nineties, the hunters began =
to=20
        notice that the sea ice was changing. (Although the claim that =
the=20
        Eskimos have hundreds of words for snow is an exaggeration, the =
Inupiat=20
        make distinctions among many different types of ice, including =
sikuliaq,=20
        "young ice," sarri, "pack ice," and tuvaq, "landlocked ice.") =
The ice=20
        was starting to form later in the fall, and also to break up =
earlier in=20
        the spring. Once, it had been possible to drive out twenty =
miles; now,=20
        by the time the seals arrived, the ice was mushy half that =
distance from=20
        shore. Weyiouanna described it as having the consistency of a =
"slush=20
        puppy." When you encounter it, he said, "your hair starts =
sticking up.=20
        Your eyes are wide open. You can't even blink." It became too =
dangerous=20
        to hunt using snowmobiles, and the men switched to boats.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the changes in the sea ice =
brought=20
        other problems. At its highest point, Shishmaref is only =
twenty-two feet=20
        above sea level, and the houses, many built by the US =
government, are=20
        small, boxy, and not particularly sturdy-looking. When the =
Chukchi Sea=20
        froze early, the layer of ice protected the village, the way a =
tarp=20
        prevents a swimming pool from getting roiled by the wind. When =
the sea=20
        started to freeze later, Shishmaref became more vulnerable to =
storm=20
        surges. A storm in October, 1997, scoured away a=20
        hundred-and-twenty-five-foot-wide strip from the town's northern =
edge;=20
        several houses were destroyed, and more than a dozen had to be=20
        relocated. During another storm, in October, 2001, the village =
was=20
        threatened by twelve-foot waves. In the summer of 2002, =
residents of=20
        Shishmaref voted, a hundred and sixty-one to twenty, to move the =
entire=20
        village to the mainland. Last year, the federal government =
completed a=20
        survey of possible sites for a new village. Most of the spots =
that are=20
        being considered are in areas nearly as remote as Sarichef, with =
no=20
        roads or nearby cities, or even settlements. It is estimated =
that a full=20
        relocation will cost at least a hundred and eighty million =
dollars.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People I spoke to in Shishmaref =
expressed=20
        divided emotions about the proposed move. Some worried that, by =
leaving=20
        the tiny island, they would give up their connection to the sea =
and=20
        become lost. "It makes me feel lonely," one woman said. Others =
seemed=20
        excited by the prospect of gaining certain conveniences, like =
running=20
        water, that Shishmaref lacks. Everyone seemed to agree, though, =
that the=20
        village's situation, already dire, was likely only to get worse. =

        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris Kiyutelluk, who is sixty-five, =
has=20
        lived in Shishmaref almost all his life. (His last name, he told =
me,=20
        means "without a wooden spoon.") I spoke to him while I was =
hanging=20
        around the basement of the village church, which also serves as =
the=20
        unofficial headquarters for a group called the Shishmaref =
Erosion and=20
        Relocation Coalition. "The first time I heard about global =
warming, I=20
        thought, I don't believe those Japanese," Kiyutelluk told me. =
"Well,=20
        they had some good scientists, and it's become true."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Academy of Sciences =
undertook=20
        its first rigorous study of global warming in 1979. At that =
point,=20
        climate modeling was still in its infancy, and only a few =
groups, one=20
        led by Syukuro Manabe, at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric=20
        Administration, and another by James Hansen, at NASA's Goddard =
Institute=20
        for Space Studies, had considered in any detail the effects of =
adding=20
        carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Still, the results of their =
work were=20
        alarming enough that President Jimmy Carter called on the =
academy to=20
        investigate. A nine-member panel was appointed, led by the =
distinguished=20
        meteorologist Jule Charney, of M.I.T.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ad Hoc Study Group on Carbon =
Dioxide and=20
        Climate, or the Charney panel, as it became known, met for five =
days at=20
        the National Academy of Sciences' summer study center, in Woods =
Hole,=20
        Massachusetts. Its conclusions were unequivocal. Panel members =
had=20
        looked for flaws in the modelers' work but had been unable to =
find any.=20
        "If carbon dioxide continues to increase, the study group finds =
no=20
        reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason =
to=20
        believe that these changes will be negligible," the scientists =
wrote.=20
        For a doubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels, they put the =
likely=20
        global temperature rise at between two and a half and eight =
degrees=20
        Fahrenheit. The panel members weren't sure how long it would =
take for=20
        changes already set in motion to become manifest, mainly because =
the=20
        climate system has a built-in time delay. It could take "several =

        decades," they noted. For this reason, what might seem like the =
most=20
        conservative approach - waiting for evidence of warming in order =
to=20
        assess the models' accuracy - actually amounted to the riskiest =
possible=20
        strategy: "We may not be given a warning until the CO2 loading =
is such=20
        that an appreciable climate change is inevitable."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now twenty-five years since the =
Charney=20
        panel issued its report, and, in that period, Americans have =
been=20
        alerted to the dangers of global warming so many times that =
volumes have=20
        been written just on the history of efforts to draw attention to =
the=20
        problem. (The National Academy of Sciences alone has issued =
nearly two=20
        hundred reports on global warming; the most recent, "Radiative =
Forcing=20
        of Climate Change," was published just last month.) During this =
same=20
        period, worldwide carbon-dioxide emissions have continued to =
increase,=20
        from five billion metric tons a year to seven billion, and the =
earth's=20
        temperature, much as predicted by Manabe's and Hansen's models, =
has=20
        steadily risen. The year 1990 was the warmest year on record =
until 1991,=20
        which was equally hot. Almost every subsequent year has been =
warmer=20
        still. The year 1998 ranks as the hottest year since the =
instrumental=20
        temperature record began, but it is closely followed by 2002 and =
2003,=20
        which are tied for second; 2001, which is third; and 2004, which =
is=20
        fourth. Since climate is innately changeable, it's difficult to =
say=20
        when, exactly, in this sequence natural variation could be ruled =
out as=20
        the sole cause. The American Geophysical Union, one of the =
nation's=20
        largest and most respected scientific organizations, decided in =
2003=20
        that the matter had been settled. At the group's annual meeting =
that=20
        year, it issued a consensus statement declaring, "Natural =
influences=20
        cannot explain the rapid increase in global near-surface =
temperatures."=20
        As best as can be determined, the world is now warmer than it =
has been=20
        at any point in the last two millennia, and, if current trends =
continue,=20
        by the end of the century it will likely be hotter than at any =
point in=20
        the last two million years.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way that global warming =
has=20
        gradually ceased to be merely a theory, so, too, its impacts are =
no=20
        longer just hypothetical. Nearly every major glacier in the =
world is=20
        shrinking; those in Glacier National Park are retreating so =
quickly it=20
        has been estimated that they will vanish entirely by 2030. The =
oceans=20
        are becoming not just warmer but more acidic; the difference =
between day=20
        and nighttime temperatures is diminishing; animals are shifting =
their=20
        ranges poleward; and plants are blooming days, and in some cases =
weeks,=20
        earlier than they used to. These are the warning signs that the =
Charney=20
        panel cautioned against waiting for, and while in many parts of =
the=20
        globe they are still subtle enough to be overlooked, in others =
they can=20
        no longer be ignored. As it happens, the most dramatic changes =
are=20
        occurring in those places, like Shishmaref, where the fewest =
people tend=20
        to live. This disproportionate effect of global warming in the =
far north=20
        was also predicted by early climate models, which forecast, in =
column=20
        after column of fortran-generated figures, what today can be =
measured=20
        and observed directly: the Arctic is melting.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the land in the Arctic, and =
nearly a=20
        quarter of all the land in the Northern Hemisphere - some five =
and a=20
        half billion acres - is under-laid by zones of permafrost. A few =
months=20
        after I visited Shishmaref, I took a trip through the interior =
of Alaska=20
        with Vladimir Romanovsky, a geophysicist and permafrost expert =
at the=20
        University of Alaska. I flew into Fairbanks, where Romanovsky =
lives, and=20
        when I arrived the whole city was enveloped in a dense haze that =
looked=20
        like fog but smelled like burning rubber. People kept telling me =
that I=20
        was lucky I hadn't come a couple of weeks earlier, when it had =
been much=20
        worse. "Even the dogs were wearing masks," one woman I met said. =
I must=20
        have smiled. "I am not joking," she told me.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairbanks, Alaska's second-largest =
city, is=20
        surrounded on all sides by forest, and virtually every summer =
lightning=20
        sets off fires in these forests, which fill the air with smoke =
for a few=20
        days or, in bad years, weeks. This past summer, the fires =
started early,=20
        in June, and were still burning two and a half months later; by =
the time=20
        of my visit, in late August, a record 6.3 million acres - an =
area=20
        roughly the size of New Hampshire - had been incinerated. The =
severity=20
        of the fires was clearly linked to the weather, which had been=20
        exceptionally hot and dry; the average summertime temperature in =

        Fairbanks was the highest on record, and the amount of rainfall =
was the=20
        third lowest.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my second day in Fairbanks, =
Romanovsky=20
        picked me up at my hotel for an underground tour of the city. =
Like most=20
        permafrost experts, he is from Russia. (The Soviets more or less =

        invented the study of permafrost when they decided to build =
their gulags=20
        in Siberia.) A broad man with shaggy brown hair and a square =
jaw,=20
        Romanovsky as a student had had to choose between playing =
professional=20
        hockey and becoming a geophysicist. He had opted for the latter, =
he told=20
        me, because "I was little bit better scientist than hockey =
player." He=20
        went on to earn two master's degrees and two Ph.D.s. Romanovsky =
came to=20
        get me at 10 a.m.; owing to all the smoke, it looked like dawn.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any piece of ground that has remained =
frozen=20
        for at least two years is, by definition, permafrost. In some =
places,=20
        like eastern Siberia, permafrost runs nearly a mile deep; in =
Alaska, it=20
        varies from a couple of hundred feet to a couple of thousand =
feet deep.=20
        Fairbanks, which is just below the Arctic Circle, is situated in =
a=20
        region of discontinuous permafrost, meaning that the city is =
freckled=20
        with regions of frozen ground. One of the first stops on =
Romanovsky's=20
        tour was a hole that had opened up in a patch of permafrost not =
far from=20
        his house. It was about six feet wide and five feet deep. Nearby =
were=20
        the outlines of other, even bigger holes, which, Romanovsky told =
me, had=20
        been filled with gravel by the local public-works department. =
The holes,=20
        known as thermokarsts, had appeared suddenly when the permafrost =
gave=20
        way, like a rotting floorboard. (The technical term for thawed=20
        permafrost is talik, from a Russian word meaning "not frozen.") =
Across=20
        the road, Romanovsky pointed out a long trench running into the =
woods.=20
        The trench, he explained, had been formed when a wedge of =
underground=20
        ice had melted. The spruce trees that had been growing next to =
it, or=20
        perhaps on top of it, were now listing at odd angles, as if in a =
gale.=20
        Locally, such trees are called "drunken." A few of the spruces =
had=20
        fallen over. "These are very drunk," Romanovsky said.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Alaska, the ground is riddled with =
ice=20
        wedges that were created during the last glaciation, when the =
cold earth=20
        cracked and the cracks filled with water. The wedges, which can =
be=20
        dozens or even hundreds of feet deep, tended to form in =
networks, so=20
        that when they melt they leave behind connecting diamond- or=20
        hexagonal-shaped depressions. A few blocks beyond the drunken =
forest, we=20
        came to a house where the front yard showed clear signs of =
ice-wedge=20
        melt-off. The owner, trying to make the best of things, had =
turned the=20
        yard into a miniature-golf course. Around the corner, Romanovsky =
pointed=20
        out a house - no longer occupied - that had basically split in =
two; the=20
        main part was leaning to the right and the garage toward the =
left. The=20
        house had been built in the sixties or early seventies; it had =
survived=20
        until almost a decade ago, when the permafrost under it started =
to=20
        degrade. Romanovsky's mother-in-law used to own two houses on =
the same=20
        block. He had urged her to sell them both. He pointed out one, =
now under=20
        new ownership; its roof had developed an ominous-looking ripple. =
(When=20
        Romanovsky went to buy his own house, he looked only in =
permafrost-free=20
        areas.)=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten years ago, nobody cared about=20
        permafrost," he told me. "Now everybody wants to know." =
Measurements=20
        that Romanovsky and his colleagues at the University of Alaska =
have made=20
        around Fairbanks show that the temperature of the permafrost has =
risen=20
        to the point where, in many places, it is now less than one =
degree below=20
        freezing. In places where permafrost has been disturbed, by =
roads or=20
        houses or lawns, much of it is already thawing. Romanovsky has =
also been=20
        monitoring the permafrost on the North Slope and has found that =
there,=20
        too, are regions where the permafrost is very nearly thirty-two =
degrees=20
        Fahrenheit. While the age of permafrost is difficult to =
determine,=20
        Romanovsky estimates that most of it in Alaska probably dates =
back to=20
        the beginning of the last glacial cycle. This means that if it =
thaws it=20
        will be doing so for the first time in more than a hundred and =
twenty=20
        thousand years. "It's really a very interesting time," he said.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Romanovsky picked =
me up at=20
        seven. We were going to drive from Fairbanks nearly five hundred =
miles=20
        north to the town of Deadhorse, on Prudhoe Bay, to collect data =
from=20
        electronic monitoring stations that Romanovsky had set up. Since =
the=20
        road was largely unpaved, he had rented a truck for the =
occasion. Its=20
        windshield was cracked in several places. When I suggested this =
could be=20
        a problem, Romanovsky assured me that it was "typical Alaska." =
For=20
        provisions, he had brought along an oversized bag of Tostitos.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road that we were travelling on =
had been=20
        built for Alaskan oil, and the pipeline followed it, sometimes =
to the=20
        left, sometimes to the right. (Because of the permafrost, the =
pipeline=20
        runs mostly aboveground, on pilings.) Trucks kept passing us, =
some with=20
        severed caribou heads strapped to their roofs, others =
advertising the=20
        Alyeska Pipeline Service Company. About two hours outside =
Fairbanks, we=20
        started to pass through tracts of forest that had recently =
burned, then=20
        tracts that were still smoldering, and, finally, tracts that =
were still,=20
        intermittently, in flames. The scene was part Dante, part =
"Apocalypse=20
        Now." We crawled along through the smoke. Beyond the town of =
Coldfoot -=20
        really just a gas station - we passed the tree line. An =
evergreen was=20
        marked with a plaque that read "Farthest North Spruce Tree on =
the Alaska=20
        Pipeline: Do Not Cut." Predictably, someone had taken a knife to =
it. A=20
        deep gouge around the trunk was bound with duct tape. "I think =
it will=20
        die," Romanovsky said.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, at around five in the =
afternoon, we=20
        reached the turnoff for the first monitoring station. Because =
one of=20
        Romanovsky's colleagues had nursed dreams - never realized - of=20
        traveling to it by plane, it was near a small airstrip, on the =
far side=20
        of a river. We pulled on rubber boots and forded the river, =
which, owing=20
        to the lack of rain, was running low. The site consisted of a =
few posts=20
        sunk into the tundra; a solar panel; a two-hundred-foot-deep =
borehole=20
        with heavy-gauge wire sticking out of it; and a white container, =

        resembling an ice chest, that held computer equipment. The solar =
panel,=20
        which the previous summer had been mounted a few feet off the =
ground,=20
        was now resting on the scrub. At first, Romanovsky speculated =
that this=20
        was a result of vandalism, but after inspecting things more =
closely he=20
        decided that it was the work of a bear. While he hooked up a =
laptop=20
        computer to one of the monitors inside the white container, my =
job was=20
        to keep an eye out for wildlife.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same reason that it is sweaty =
in a=20
        coal mine - heat flux from the center of the earth - permafrost =
gets=20
        warmer the farther down you go. Under equilibrium conditions - =
which is=20
        to say, when the climate is stable - the very warmest =
temperatures in a=20
        borehole will be found at the bottom and they will decrease =
steadily as=20
        you go higher. In these circumstances, the lowest temperature =
will be=20
        found at the permafrost's surface, so that, plotted on a graph, =
the=20
        results will be a tilted line. In recent decades, though, the=20
        temperature profile of Alaska's permafrost has drooped. Now, =
instead of=20
        a straight line, what you get is shaped more like a sickle. The=20
        permafrost is still warmest at the very bottom, but instead of =
being=20
        coldest at the top it is coldest somewhere in the middle, and =
warmer=20
        again toward the surface. This is an unambiguous sign that the =
climate=20
        is heating up.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very difficult to look at =
trends in air=20
        temperature, because it's so variable," Romanovsky explained =
after we=20
        were back in the truck, bouncing along toward Deadhorse. It =
turned out=20
        that he had brought the Tostitos to stave off not hunger but =
fatigue -=20
        the crunching, he said, kept him awake - and by now the bag was =
more=20
        than half empty. "So one year you have around Fairbanks a mean =
annual=20
        temperature of zero" - thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit - "and you =
say, 'Oh=20
        yeah, it's warming,' and other years you have a mean annual =
temperature=20
        of minus six" - twenty-one degrees Fahrenheit - "and everybody =
says,=20
        'Where? Where is your global warming?' In the air temperature, =
the=20
        signal is very small compared to noise. What permafrost does is =
it works=20
        as a low-pass filter. That's why we can see trends much easier =
in=20
        permafrost temperatures than we can see them in atmosphere." In =
most=20
        parts of Alaska, the permafrost has warmed by three degrees =
since the=20
        early nineteen-eighties. In some parts of the state, it has =
warmed by=20
        nearly six degrees.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you walk around in the Arctic, =
you are=20
        stepping not on permafrost but on something called the "active =
layer."=20
        The active layer, which can be anywhere from a few inches to a =
few feet=20
        deep, freezes in the winter but thaws over the summer, and it is =
what=20
        supports the growth of plants - large spruce trees in places =
where=20
        conditions are favorable enough and, where they aren't, shrubs =
and,=20
        finally, just lichen. Life in the active layer proceeds much as =
it does=20
        in more temperate regions, with one critical difference. =
Temperatures=20
        are so low that when trees and grasses die they do not fully =
decompose.=20
        New plants grow out of the half-rotted old ones, and when these =
plants=20
        die the same thing happens all over again. Eventually, through a =
process=20
        known as cryoturbation, organic matter is pushed down beneath =
the active=20
        layer into the permafrost, where it can sit for thousands of =
years in a=20
        botanical version of suspended animation. (In Fairbanks, grass =
that is=20
        still green has been found in permafrost dating back to the =
middle of=20
        the last ice age.) In this way, much like a peat bog or, for =
that=20
        matter, a coal deposit, permafrost acts as a storage unit for=20
        accumulated carbon.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the risks of rising =
temperatures is=20
        that this storage process can start to run in reverse. Under the =
right=20
        conditions, organic material that has been frozen for millennia =
will=20
        break down, giving off carbon dioxide or methane, which is an =
even more=20
        powerful greenhouse gas. In parts of the Arctic, this is already =

        happening. Researchers in Sweden, for example, have been =
measuring the=20
        methane output of a bog known as the Stordalen mire, near the =
town of=20
        Abisko, for almost thirty-five years. As the permafrost in the =
area has=20
        warmed, methane releases have increased, in some spots by up to =
sixty=20
        per cent. Thawing permafrost could make the active layer more =
hospitable=20
        to plants, which are a sink for carbon. Even this, though, =
probably=20
        wouldn't offset the release of greenhouse gases. No one knows =
exactly=20
        how much carbon is stored in the world's permafrost, but =
estimates run=20
        as high as four hundred and fifty billion metric tons.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like ready-use mix - just a =
little=20
        heat, and it will start cooking," Romanovsky told me. It was the =
day=20
        after we had arrived in Deadhorse, and we were driving through a =
steady=20
        drizzle out to another monitoring site. "I think it's just a =
time bomb,=20
        just waiting for a little warmer conditions." Romanovsky was =
wearing a=20
        rain suit over his canvas work clothes. I put on a rain suit =
that he had=20
        brought along for me. He pulled a tarp out of the back of the =
truck.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever he has had funding, =
Romanovsky has=20
        added new monitoring sites to his network. There are now sixty =
of them,=20
        and while we were on the North Slope he spent all day and also =
part of=20
        the night - it stayed light until nearly eleven - rushing from =
one to=20
        the next. At each site, the routine was more or less the same. =
First,=20
        Romanovsky would hook up his computer to the data logger, which =
had been=20
        recording permafrost temperatures on an hourly basis since the =
previous=20
        summer. (When it was raining, he would perform this step hunched =
under=20
        the tarp.) Then he would take out a metal probe shaped like a =
"T" and=20
        poke it into the ground at regular intervals, measuring the =
depth of the=20
        active layer. The probe was a metre long, which, it turned out, =
was no=20
        longer quite long enough. The summer had been so warm that =
almost=20
        everywhere the active layer had grown deeper, in some spots by =
just a=20
        few centimeters, in other spots by more than that; in places =
where the=20
        active layer was particularly deep, Romanovsky had had to work =
out a new=20
        way of measuring it using the probe and a wooden ruler. =
Eventually, he=20
        explained, the heat that had gone into increasing the depth of =
the=20
        active layer would work its way downward, bringing the =
permafrost that=20
        much closer to the thawing point. "Come back next year," he =
advised me.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last day I spent on the North =
Slope, a=20
        friend of Romanovsky's, Nicolai Panikov, a microbiologist at the =
Stevens=20
        Institute of Technology, in New Jersey, arrived. Panikov had =
come to=20
        collect cold-loving micro=C3=B6rganisms known as psychrophiles. =
He was=20
        planning to study these organisms in order to determine whether =
they=20
        could have functioned in the sort of conditions that, it is =
believed,=20
        were once found on Mars. Panikov told me that he was quite =
convinced=20
        that Martian life existed - or, at least, had existed. =
Romanovsky=20
        expressed his opinion on this by rolling his eyes; nevertheless, =
he had=20
        agreed to help Panikov dig up some permafrost.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That day, I also flew with Romanovsky =
by=20
        helicopter to a small island in the Arctic Ocean, where he had =
set up=20
        yet another monitoring site. The island, just north of the =
seventieth=20
        parallel, was a bleak expanse of mud dotted with little clumps =
of=20
        yellowing vegetation. It was filled with ice wedges that were =
starting=20
        to melt, creating a network of polygonal depressions. The =
weather was=20
        cold and wet, so while Romanovsky hunched under his tarp I =
stayed in the=20
        helicopter and chatted with the pilot. He had lived in Alaska =
since=20
        1967. "It's definitely gotten warmer since I've been here," he =
told me.=20
        "I have really noticed that."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Romanovsky emerged, we took a =
walk=20
        around the island. Apparently, in the spring it had been a =
nesting site=20
        for birds, because everywhere we went there were bits of =
eggshell and=20
        piles of droppings. The island was only about ten feet above sea =
level,=20
        and at the edges it dropped off sharply into the water. =
Romanovsky=20
        pointed out a spot along the shore where the previous summer a =
series of=20
        ice wedges had been exposed. They had since melted, and the =
ground=20
        behind them had given way in a cascade of black mud. In a few =
years, he=20
        said, he expected more ice wedges would be exposed, and then =
these would=20
        melt, causing further erosion. Although the process was =
different in its=20
        mechanics from what was going on in Shishmaref, it had much the =
same=20
        cause and, according to Romanovsky, was likely to have the same =
result.=20
        "Another disappearing island," he said, gesturing toward some =
freshly=20
        exposed bluffs. "It's moving very, very fast."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 18, 1997, the Des =
Groseilliers,=20
        a three-hundred-and-eighteen-foot-long icebreaker with a =
bright-red=20
        hull, set out from the town of Tuktoyaktuk, on the Beaufort Sea, =
and=20
        headed north under overcast skies. Normally, the Des =
Groseilliers, which=20
        is based in Qu=C3=A9bec City, is used by the Canadian Coast =
Guard, but for=20
        this particular journey it was carrying a group of American=20
        geophysicists, who were planning to jam it into an ice floe. The =

        scientists were hoping to conduct a series of experiments as =
they and=20
        the ship and the ice floe all drifted, as one, around the Arctic =
Ocean.=20
        The expedition had taken several years to prepare for, and =
during the=20
        planning phase its organizers had carefully consulted the =
findings of a=20
        previous Arctic expedition, which took place back in 1975. Based =
on=20
        those findings, they had decided to look for a floe averaging =
nine feet=20
        thick. But when they reached the area where they planned to =
over-winter=20
        - at seventy-five degrees north latitude - they found that not =
only were=20
        there no floes nine feet thick but there were barely any that =
reached=20
        six feet. One of the scientists on board recalled the reaction =
on the=20
        Des Groseilliers this way: "It was like 'Here we are, all =
dressed up and=20
        nowhere to go.' We imagined calling the sponsors at the National =
Science=20
        Foundation and saying, 'Well, you know, we can't find any ice.' =
"=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea ice in the Arctic comes in two =
varieties.=20
        There is seasonal ice, which forms in the winter and then melts =
in the=20
        summer, and perennial ice, which persists year-round. To the =
untrained=20
        eye, all sea ice looks pretty much the same, but by licking it =
you can=20
        get a good idea of how long a particular piece has been floating =
around.=20
        When ice begins to form in seawater, it forces out the salt, =
which has=20
        no place in the crystal structure. As the ice gets thicker, the =
rejected=20
        salt collects in tiny pockets of brine too highly concentrated =
to=20
        freeze. If you suck on a piece of first-year ice, it will taste =
salty.=20
        Eventually, if the ice survives, these pockets of brine drain =
out=20
        through fine, vein-like channels, and the ice becomes fresher. =
Multiyear=20
        ice is so fresh that if you melt it you can drink it.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most precise measurements of =
Arctic sea=20
        ice have been made by NASA, using satellites equipped with =
microwave=20
        sensors. In 1979, the satellite data show, perennial sea ice =
covered 1.7=20
        billion acres, or an area nearly the size of the continental =
United=20
        States. The ice's extent varies from year to year, but since =
then the=20
        over-all trend has been strongly downward. The losses have been=20
        particularly great in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, and also=20
        considerable in the Siberian and Laptev Seas. During this same =
period,=20
        an atmospheric circulation pattern known as the Arctic =
Oscillation has=20
        mostly been in what climatologists call a "positive" mode. The =
positive=20
        Arctic Oscillation is marked by low pressure over the Arctic =
Ocean, and=20
        it tends to produce strong winds and higher temperatures in the =
far=20
        north. No one really knows whether the recent behavior of the =
Arctic=20
        Oscillation is independent of global warming or a product of it. =
By now,=20
        though, the perennial sea ice has shrunk by roughly two hundred =
and=20
        fifty million acres, an area the size of New York, Georgia, and =
Texas=20
        combined. According to mathematical models, even the extended =
period of=20
        a positive Arctic Oscillation can account for only part of this =
loss.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers aboard the Des =
Groseilliers=20
        knew that the Arctic sea ice was retreating; that was, in fact, =
why they=20
        were there. At the time, however, there wasn't much data on =
trends in=20
        sea-ice depth. (Since then, a limited amount of information on =
this=20
        topic - gathered, for rather different purposes, by nuclear =
submarines -=20
        has been declassified.) Eventually, the researchers decided to =
settle=20
        for the best ice floe they could find. They picked one that =
stretched=20
        over some thirty square miles and in some spots was six feet =
thick, in=20
        some spots three. Tents were set up on the floe to house =
experiments,=20
        and a safety protocol was established: anyone venturing out onto =
the ice=20
        had to travel with a buddy and a radio. (Many also carried a =
gun, in=20
        case of polar-bear problems.) Some of the scientists speculated =
that,=20
        since the ice was abnormally thin, it would grow during the =
expedition.=20
        The opposite turned out to be the case. The Des Groseilliers =
spent=20
        twelve months frozen into the floe, and, during that time, it =
drifted=20
        some three hundred miles north. Nevertheless, at the end of the =
year,=20
        the average thickness of the ice had declined, in some spots by =
as much=20
        as a third. By August, 1998, so many of the scientists had =
fallen=20
        through that a new requirement was added to the protocol: anyone =
who set=20
        foot off the ship had to wear a life jacket.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald Perovich has studied sea ice =
for=20
        thirty years, and on a rainy day last fall I went to visit him =
at his=20
        office in Hanover, New Hampshire. Perovich works for the Cold =
Regions=20
        Research and Engineering Laboratory, or crrel (pronounced =
"crell"), a=20
        division of the US Army established in 1961 in anticipation of a =
very=20
        cold war. (The assumption was that if the Soviets invaded they =
would=20
        probably do so from the north.) He is a tall man with black =
hair, very=20
        black eyebrows, and an earnest manner. His office is decorated =
with=20
        photographs from the Des Groseilliers expedition, for which he =
served as=20
        the lead scientist; there are shots of the ship, the tents, and, =
if you=20
        look closely enough, the bears. One grainy-looking photo shows =
someone=20
        dressed up as Santa Claus, celebrating Christmas out on the ice. =
"The=20
        most fun you could ever have" was how Perovich described the =
expedition=20
        to me.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perovich's particular area of =
expertise, in=20
        the words of his crrel biography, is "the interaction of solar =
radiation=20
        with sea ice." During the Des Groseilliers expedition, he spent =
most of=20
        his time monitoring conditions on the floe using a device known =
as a=20
        spectroradiometer. Facing toward the sun, a spectroradiometer =
measures=20
        incident light, and facing toward earth it measures reflected =
light. If=20
        you divide the latter by the former, you get a quantity known as =
albedo.=20
        (The term comes from the Latin word for "whiteness.") During =
April and=20
        May, when conditions on the floe were relatively stable, =
Perovich took=20
        measurements with his spectroradiometer once a week, and during =
June,=20
        July, and August, when they were changing more rapidly, he took=20
        measurements every other day. The arrangement allowed him to =
plot=20
        exactly how the albedo varied as the snow on top of the ice =
turned to=20
        slush, and then the slush became puddles, and, finally, some of =
the=20
        puddles melted through to the water below.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ideal white surface, which =
reflected all=20
        the light that shone on it, would have an albedo of one, and an =
ideal=20
        black surface, which absorbed all the light, would have an =
albedo of=20
        zero. The albedo of the earth, in aggregate, is 0.3, meaning =
that a=20
        little less than a third of the sunlight that hits it gets =
reflected=20
        back out. Anything that changes the earth's albedo changes how =
much=20
        energy the planet absorbs, with potentially dramatic =
consequences. "I=20
        like it because it deals with simple concepts, but it's =
important,"=20
        Perovich told me.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one point, Perovich asked me to =
imagine=20
        that we were looking down at the earth from a spaceship above =
the North=20
        Pole. "It's springtime, and the ice is covered with snow, and =
it's=20
        really bright and white," he said. "It reflects over eighty per =
cent of=20
        the incident sunlight. The albedo's around 0.8, 0.9. Now, let's =
suppose=20
        that we melt that ice away and we're left with the ocean. The =
albedo of=20
        the ocean is less than 0.1; it's like 0.07.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only is the albedo of the =
snow-covered=20
        ice high; it's the highest of anything we find on earth," he =
went on.=20
        "And not only is the albedo of water low; it's pretty much as =
low as=20
        anything you can find on earth. So what you're doing is you're =
replacing=20
        the best reflector with the worst reflector." The more open =
water that's=20
        exposed, the more solar energy goes into heating the ocean. The =
result=20
        is a positive feedback, similar to the one between thawing =
permafrost=20
        and carbon releases, only more direct. This so-called ice-albedo =

        feedback is believed to be a major reason that the Arctic is =
warming so=20
        rapidly.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As we melt that ice back, we can put =
more=20
        heat into the system, which means we can melt the ice back even =
more,=20
        which means we can put more heat into it, and, you see, it just =
kind of=20
        builds on itself," Perovich said. "It takes a small nudge to the =
climate=20
        system and amplifies it into a big change."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few dozen miles to the east of =
crrel, not=20
        far from the Maine-New Hampshire border, is a small park called =
the=20
        Madison Boulder Natural Area. The park's major - indeed, only -=20
        attraction is a block of granite the size of a two-story house. =
The=20
        Madison Boulder is thirty-seven feet wide and eighty-three feet =
long and=20
        weighs about ten million pounds. It was plucked out of the White =

        Mountains and deposited in its current location eleven thousand =
years=20
        ago, and it illustrates how relatively minor changes to the =
climate=20
        system have, when amplified, yielded cataclysmic results.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geologically speaking, we are now =
living in a=20
        warm period after an ice age. Over the past two million years, =
huge ice=20
        sheets have advanced across the Northern Hemisphere and =
retreated again=20
        more than twenty times. (Each major glaciation tended, for =
obvious=20
        reasons, to destroy the evidence of its predecessors.) The most =
recent=20
        advance, called the Wisconsin, began roughly a hundred and =
twenty=20
        thousand years ago, when ice began to creep outward from centers =
in=20
        Scandinavia, Siberia, and the highlands near Hudson Bay. By the =
time the=20
        sheets had reached their maximum southern extent, most of New =
England=20
        and New York and a good part of the upper Midwest were buried =
under ice=20
        nearly a mile thick. The ice sheets were so heavy that they =
depressed=20
        the crust of the earth, pushing it down into the mantle. (In =
some=20
        places, the process of recovery, known as isostatic rebound, is =
still=20
        going on.) As the ice retreated, it deposited, among other =
landmarks,=20
        the terminal moraine called Long Island.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now known, or at least almost=20
        universally accepted, that glacial cycles are initiated by =
slight,=20
        periodic variations in the earth's orbit. These orbital =
variations alter=20
        the distribution of sunlight at different latitudes during =
different=20
        seasons according to a complex pattern that takes a hundred =
thousand=20
        years to complete. But orbital variations in themselves aren't =
nearly=20
        sufficient to produce the sort of massive ice sheet that moved =
the=20
        Madison Boulder.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crushing size of that ice sheet, =
the=20
        Laurentide, which stretched over some five million square miles, =
was the=20
        result of feedbacks, more or less analogous to those now being =
studied=20
        in the Arctic, only operating in reverse. As ice built up, =
albedo=20
        increased, leading to less heat absorption and the growth of yet =
more=20
        ice. At the same time, for reasons that are not entirely =
understood, as=20
        the ice sheets advanced CO2 levels declined: during each of the =
most=20
        recent glaciations, carbon-dioxide levels dropped almost =
precisely in=20
        synch with falling temperatures. During each warm period, when =
the ice=20
        retreated, CO2 levels rose again. Ice cores from Antarctica =
contain a=20
        record of the atmosphere stretching back more than four glacial =
cycles -=20
        minute samples of air get trapped in tiny bubbles - and =
researchers who=20
        have studied these cores have concluded that fully half the =
temperature=20
        difference between cold periods and warm ones can be attributed =
to=20
        changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases. Antarctic ice =
cores=20
        also show that carbon-dioxide levels today are significantly =
higher than=20
        they have been at any other point in the last four hundred and =
twenty=20
        thousand years.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was at crrel, Perovich took =
me to=20
        meet a colleague of his named John Weatherly. Posted on =
Weatherly's=20
        office door was a bumper sticker designed to be pasted - =
illicitly - on=20
        S.U.V.s. It said, "I'm Changing the Climate! Ask Me How!" For =
the last=20
        several years, Weatherly and Perovich have been working to =
translate the=20
        data gathered on the Des Groseilliers expedition into computer=20
        algorithms to be used in climate forecasting. Weatherly told me =
that=20
        some climate models - worldwide, there are about fifteen major =
ones in=20
        operation - predict that the perennial sea-ice cover in the =
Arctic will=20
        disappear entirely by the year 2080. At that point, although =
there would=20
        continue to be seasonal ice that forms in winter, in summer the =
Arctic=20
        Ocean would be completely ice-free. "That's not in our =
lifetime," he=20
        observed. "But it is in the lifetime of our kids."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, back in his office, Perovich =
and I=20
        talked about the long-term prospects for the Arctic. Perovich =
noted that=20
        the earth's climate system is so vast that it is not easily =
altered. "On=20
        the one hand, you think, It's the earth's climate system, it's =
big; it's=20
        robust. And, indeed, it has to be somewhat robust or else it =
would be=20
        changing all the time." On the other hand, the climate record =
shows that=20
        it would be a mistake to assume that change, when it comes, will =
come=20
        slowly. Perovich offered a comparison that he had heard from a=20
        glaciologist friend. The friend likened the climate system to a =
rowboat:=20
        "You can tip and then you'll just go back. You can tip it and =
just go=20
        back. And then you tip it and you get to the other stable state, =
which=20
        is upside down."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perovich said that he also liked a =
regional=20
        analogy. "The way I've been thinking about it, riding my bike =
around=20
        here, is, You ride by all these pastures and they've got these =
big=20
        granite boulders in the middle of them. You've got a big boulder =
sitting=20
        there on this rolling hill. You can't just go by this boulder. =
You've=20
        got to try to push it. So you start rocking it, and you get a =
bunch of=20
        friends, and they start rocking it, and finally it starts =
moving. And=20
        then you realize, Maybe this wasn't the best idea. That's what =
we're=20
        doing as a society. This climate, if it starts rolling, we don't =
really=20
        know where it will stop."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a cause for alarm, global warming =
could be=20
        said to be a nineteen-seventies idea; as pure science, however, =
it is=20
        much older than that. In 1859, a British physicist named John =
Tyndall,=20
        experimenting with a machine he had built - the world's first =
ratio=20
        spectrophotometer - set out to study the heat-trapping =
properties of=20
        various gases. Tyndall found that the most common elements in =
the air -=20
        oxygen and nitrogen - were transparent to both visible and =
infrared=20
        radiation. Gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, =
by=20
        contrast, were not. Tyndall was quick to appreciate the =
implications of=20
        his discovery: the imperfectly transparent gases, he declared, =
were=20
        largely responsible for determining the earth's climate. He =
likened=20
        their impact to that of a dam built across a river: just as a =
dam=20
        "causes a local deepening of the stream, so our atmosphere, =
thrown as a=20
        barrier across the terrestrial rays, produces a local =
heightening of the=20
        temperature at the earth's surface."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phenomenon that Tyndall =
identified is now=20
        referred to as the "natural greenhouse effect." It is not =
remotely=20
        controversial; indeed, it's an essential condition of life on =
earth as=20
        we know it. To understand how it works, it helps to imagine the =
planet=20
        without it. In that situation, the earth would constantly be =
receiving=20
        energy from the sun and, at the same time, constantly radiating =
energy=20
        back out to space. All hot bodies radiate, and the amount that =
they=20
        radiate is a function of their temperature. In order for the =
earth to be=20
        in equilibrium, the quantity of energy it sends into space must =
equal=20
        the quantity it is receiving. When, for whatever reason, =
equilibrium is=20
        disturbed, the planet will either warm up or cool down until the =

        temperature is once again sufficient to make the two energy =
streams=20
        balance out.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were no greenhouse gases, =
energy=20
        radiating from the surface of the earth would flow away from it=20
        unimpeded. In that case, it would be comparatively easy to =
calculate how=20
        warm the planet would have to get to throw back into space the =
same=20
        amount of energy it absorbs from the sun. (This amount varies =
widely by=20
        location and time of year; averaged out, it comes to some two =
hundred=20
        and thirty-five watts per square metre, or roughly the energy of =
four=20
        household light bulbs.) The result of this calculation is a =
frigid zero=20
        degrees. To use Tyndall's Victorian language, if the =
heat-trapping gases=20
        were removed from the air for a single night "the warmth of our =
fields=20
        and gardens would pour itself unrequited into space, and the sun =
would=20
        rise upon an island held fast in the iron grip of frost."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenhouse gases alter the situation =
because=20
        of their peculiar absorptive properties. The sun's radiation =
arrives=20
        mostly in the form of visible light, which greenhouse gases =
allow to=20
        pass freely. The earth's radiation, meanwhile, is emitted mostly =
in the=20
        infrared part of the spectrum. Greenhouse gases absorb infrared=20
        radiation and then reemit it - some out toward space and some =
back=20
        toward earth. This process of absorption and re=C3=ABmission has =
the effect=20
        of limiting the outward flow of energy; as a result, the earth's =
surface=20
        and lower atmosphere have to be that much warmer before the =
planet can=20
        radiate out the necessary two hundred and thirty-five watts per =
square=20
        meter. The presence of greenhouse gases is what largely accounts =
for the=20
        fact that the average global temperature, instead of zero, is =
actually a=20
        far more comfortable fifty-seven degrees.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the nineteenth century, =

        Tyndall's work on the natural greenhouse effect had been =
extended to=20
        what would today be called the "enhanced greenhouse effect." In =
1894,=20
        the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius became convinced that =
humans were=20
        altering the earth's energy balance. Much as Tyndall had tried =
to=20
        imagine what the world would be like in the absence of =
greenhouse gases,=20
        Arrhenius tried to imagine what it would be like in the presence =
of more=20
        of them. Starting on Christmas Eve, he set out to calculate what =
would=20
        happen to the earth's temperature if CO2 levels were doubled. =
Arrhenius=20
        described the calculations as some of the most tedious of his =
life. He=20
        routinely worked on them for fourteen hours a day, and was not =
finished=20
        for nearly a year. Finally, in December, 1895, he announced his =
results=20
        to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the natural greenhouse effect, =
the=20
        enhanced greenhouse effect is - in theoretical terms, at least - =

        uncontroversial. If greenhouse-gas levels in the atmosphere =
increase,=20
        all other things being equal, the earth's temperature will rise. =
The key=20
        uncertainties concern how this process will play out in =
practice, since=20
        in the real world all things rarely are equal. For several =
decades after=20
        Arrhenius completed his calculations, scientists were unsure to =
what=20
        extent mankind was even capable of affecting atmospheric =
carbon-dioxide=20
        levels; the general assumption was that the oceans would absorb =
just=20
        about everything humans could emit. Arrhenius himself predicted =
that it=20
        would take three thousand years of coal burning to double the =
CO2 in the=20
        air, a prediction, it is now known, that was off by roughly =
twenty-eight=20
        centuries.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiss Camp is a research station set =

        1990 on a platform drilled into the Greenland ice sheet. Because =
the ice=20
        sheet is moving - ice flows like water, only more slowly - the =
camp is=20
        always in motion: in fifteen years, it has migrated by more than =
a mile,=20
        generally in a westerly direction. Every summer, the whole place =
gets=20
        flooded, and every winter its contents solidify. The cumulative =
effect=20
        of all this is that almost nothing at Swiss Camp functions =
anymore the=20
        way it was supposed to. To get into it, you have to clamber up a =

        snowdrift and descend through a trapdoor in the roof, as if =
entering a=20
        ship's hold or a space module. The living quarters are no longer =

        habitable, so now the scientists at the camp sleep outside, in =
tents.=20
        (The one assigned to me was the same sort used by Robert Scott =
on his=20
        ill-fated expedition to the South Pole.) By the time I arrived =
at the=20
        camp, late last May, someone had jack-hammered out the center of =
the=20
        workspace but had left the desks encased in three-foot-high =
blocks of=20
        ice. Inside them I could dimly make out a tangle of wires, a =
bulging=20
        plastic bag, and an old dustpan.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Konrad Steffen, a professor of =
geography at=20
        the University of Colorado, is the director of Swiss Camp. A =
native of=20
        Zurich, Steffen is tall and lanky, with pale-blue eyes, blondish =
hair,=20
        and a blondish-gray beard. He fell in love with the Arctic when, =
as a=20
        graduate student in 1975, he spent a summer on Axel Heiberg =
Island, four=20
        hundred miles northwest of the north magnetic pole. A few years =
later,=20
        for his doctoral dissertation, he lived for two winters on the =
sea ice=20
        off Baffin Island. (Steffen told me that for his honeymoon he =
had wanted=20
        to take his wife to Spitsbergen, an island five hundred miles =
north of=20
        Norway, but she demurred, and they had ended up driving across =
the=20
        Sahara instead.)=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Steffen planned Swiss Camp - he =
built=20
        much of the place himself - it was not with global warming in =
mind.=20
        Rather, he was interested in meteorological conditions on what =
is known=20
        as the ice sheet's "equilibrium line." Along this line, winter =
snow and=20
        summer melt are supposed to be precisely in balance. But, in =
recent=20
        years, "equilibrium" has become an increasingly elusive quality. =
In the=20
        summer of 2002, the ice sheet melted to an unprecedented extent. =

        Satellite images taken by NASA showed that snow had melted up to =
an=20
        elevation of sixty-five hundred feet. In some of these spots, =
ice-core=20
        records revealed, liquid water had not been seen for hundreds, =
perhaps=20
        thousands, of years. The following winter, there was an =
unusually low=20
        snowfall, and in the summer of 2003 the melt was so great that, =
around=20
        Swiss Camp, five feet of ice were lost.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I arrived at the camp, the 2004 =
melt=20
        season was already under way. This, to Steffen, was a matter of =
both=20
        intense scientific interest and serious practical concern. A few =
days=20
        earlier, one of his graduate students, Russell Huff, and a =
postdoc,=20
        Nicolas Cullen, had driven out on snowmobiles to service some =
weather=20
        stations closer to the coast. The snow there was melting so fast =
that=20
        they had had to work until five in the morning, and then take a =
long=20
        detour back, to avoid getting caught in the quickly forming =
rivers.=20
        Steffen wanted to get everything that needed to be done =
completed ahead=20
        of schedule, in case everyone had to pack up and leave early. My =
first=20
        day at Swiss Camp he spent fixing an antenna that had fallen =
over in the=20
        previous year's melt. It was bristling with equipment, like a =
high-tech=20
        Christmas tree. Even on a relatively warm day on the ice sheet, =
which=20
        this was, it never gets more than a few degrees above freezing, =
and I=20
        was walking around in a huge parka, two pairs of pants plus long =

        underwear, and two pairs of gloves. Steffen, meanwhile, was =
tinkering=20
        with the antenna with his bare hands. He has spent fourteen =
summers at=20
        Swiss Camp, and I asked him what he had learned during that =
time. He=20
        answered with another question.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are we disintegrating part of the =
Greenland=20
        ice sheet over the longer term?" he asked. He was sorting =
through a=20
        tangle of wires that to me all looked the same but must have had =
some=20
        sort of distinguishing characteristics. "What the regional =
models tell=20
        us is that we will get more melt at the coast. It will continue =
to melt.=20
        But warmer air can hold more water vapor, and at the top of the =
ice=20
        sheet you'll get more precipitation. So we'll add more snow =
there. We'll=20
        get an imbalance of having more accumulation at the top, and =
more melt=20
        at the bottom. The key question now is: What is the dominant =
one, the=20
        more melt or the increase?"=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenland's ice sheet is the =
second-largest=20
        on earth. (Antarctica's is the largest.) In its present form, =
the=20
        Greenland ice sheet is, quite literally, a relic of the last =
glaciation.=20
        The top layers consist of snow that fell recently. Beneath these =
layers=20
        is snow that fell centuries and then millennia ago, until, at =
the very=20
        bottom, there is snow that fell a hundred and thirty thousand =
years ago.=20
        Under current climate conditions, the ice sheet probably would =
not form,=20
        and it is only its enormous size that has sustained it for this =
long. In=20
        the middle of the island, the ice is so thick - nearly two miles =
- that=20
        it creates a kind of perpetual winter. Snow falls in central =
Greenland=20
        year-round and it never melts, although, over time, the snow =
gets=20
        compacted into ice and is pressed out toward the coast. There,=20
        eventually, it either calves off into icebergs or flows away. In =

        summertime, lakes of a spectacular iridescent blue form at the =
ice=20
        sheet's lower elevations; these empty into vast rivers that fan =
out=20
        toward the sea. Near Swiss Camp - elevation 3,770 feet - there =
is a huge=20
        depression where one such lake forms each July, but by that =
point no one=20
        is around to see it: it would be far too dangerous.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of what is known about the =
earth's=20
        climate over the last hundred thousand years comes from ice =
cores=20
        drilled in central Greenland, along a line known as the ice =
divide.=20
        Owing to differences between summer and winter snow, each layer =
in a=20
        Greenland core can be individually dated, much like the rings of =
a tree.=20
        Then, by analyzing the isotopic composition of the ice, it is =
possible=20
        to determine how cold it was at the time each layer was formed.=20
        (Although ice cores from Antarctica contain a much longer =
climate=20
        record, it is not as detailed.) Over the last decade, three =
Greenland=20
        cores have been drilled to a depth of ten thousand feet, and =
these cores=20
        have prompted a rethinking of how the climate operates. Where =
once the=20
        system was thought to change, as it were, only glacially, now it =
is=20
        known to be capable of sudden and unpredictable reversals. One =
such=20
        reversal, called the Younger Dryas, after a small Arctic plant - =
Dryas=20
        octopetala - that suddenly reappeared in Scandinavia, took place =
roughly=20
        twelve thousand eight hundred years ago. At that point, the =
earth, which=20
        had been warming rapidly, was plunged back into glacial =
conditions. It=20
        remained frigid for twelve centuries and then warmed again, even =
more=20
        abruptly. In Greenland, average annual temperatures shot up by =
nearly=20
        twenty degrees in a single decade.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a continuous temperature record, =
the=20
        Greenland ice cores stop providing reliable information right =
around the=20
        start of the last glacial cycle. Climate records pieced together =
from=20
        other sources indicate that the last interglacial, which is =
known as the=20
        Eemian, was somewhat warmer than the present one, the Holocene. =
They=20
        also show that sea levels during that time were at least fifteen =
feet=20
        higher than they are today. One theory attributes this to a =
collapse of=20
        the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. A second holds that melt-water =
from=20
        Greenland was responsible. (When sea ice melts, it does not =
affect sea=20
        level, because the ice, which was floating, was already =
displacing an=20
        equivalent volume of water.) All told, the Greenland ice sheet =
holds=20
        enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by twenty-three feet. =

        Scientists at NASA have calculated that throughout the =
nineteen-nineties=20
        the ice sheet, despite some thickening at the center, was =
shrinking by=20
        twelve cubic miles per year.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jay Zwally is a NASA scientist who =
works on a=20
        satellite project known as icesat. He is also a friend of =
Steffen's, and=20
        about ten years ago he got the idea of installing=20
        global-positioning-system receivers around Swiss Camp to study =
changes=20
        in the ice sheet's elevation. Zwally happened to be at the camp =
while I=20
        was there, and the second day of my visit we all got onto =
snowmobiles=20
        and headed out to a location known as jar 1 (for Jakobshavn =
Ablation=20
        Region) to reinstall a G.P.S. receiver. The trip was about ten =
miles.=20
        Midway through it, Zwally told me that he had once seen =
spy-satellite=20
        photos of the region we were crossing, and that they had shown =
that=20
        underneath the snow it was full of crevasses. Later, when I =
asked=20
        Steffen about this, he told me that he had had the whole area =
surveyed=20
        with bottom-seeking radar, and no crevasses of any note had been =
found.=20
        I was never sure which one of them to believe.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinstalling Zwally's G.P.S. receiver =

        entailed putting up a series of poles, a process that, in turn, =
required=20
        drilling holes thirty feet down into the ice. The drilling was =
done not=20
        mechanically but thermally, using a steam drill that consisted =
of a=20
        propane burner, a steel tank to hold snow, and a long rubber =
hose.=20
        Everyone - Steffen, Zwally, the graduate students, me - took a =
turn.=20
        This meant holding onto the hose while it melted its way down, =
an=20
        activity reminiscent of ice fishing. Seventy-five years ago, not =
far=20
        from jar 1, Alfred Wegener, the German scientist who proposed =
the theory=20
        of continental drift, died while on a meteorological expedition. =
He was=20
        buried in the ice sheet, and there is a running joke at Swiss =
Camp about=20
        stumbling onto his body. "It's Wegener!" one of the graduate =
students=20
        exclaimed, as the drill worked its way downward. The first hole =
was=20
        finished relatively quickly, at which point everyone decided -=20
        prematurely, as it turned out - that it was time for a midday =
snack.=20
        Unless a hole stays filled with water, it starts to close up =
again, and=20
        can't be used. Apparently, there were fissures in the ice, =
because water=20
        kept draining out of the next few holes that were tried. The =
original=20
        plan had been for three holes, but, some six hours later, only =
two had=20
        been drilled, and it was decided that this would have to =
suffice.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Zwally had set out to look =
for=20
        changes in the ice sheet's elevation, what he ended up measuring =
was,=20
        potentially, even more significant. His G.P.S. data showed that =
the more=20
        the ice sheet melted the faster it started to move. Thus in the =
summer=20
        of 1996, the ice around Swiss Camp moved at a rate of thirteen =
inches=20
        per day, but in 2001 it had sped up to twenty inches per day. =
The reason=20
        for this acceleration, it is believed, is that meltwater from =
the=20
        surface makes its way down to the bedrock below, where it acts =
as a=20
        lubricant. (In the process, it enlarges cracks and forms huge =
ice=20
        tunnels, known as moulins.) Zwally's measurements also showed =
that, in=20
        the summer, the ice sheet rises by about six inches, indicating =
that it=20
        is floating on a cushion of water.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the last glaciation, =
the ice=20
        sheets that covered much of the Northern Hemisphere disappeared =
in a=20
        matter of a few thousand years - a surprisingly short time, =
considering=20
        how long it had taken them to build up. At one point, about =
fourteen=20
        thousand years ago, they were melting so fast that sea levels =
were=20
        rising at the rate of more than a foot a decade. Just how this =
happened=20
        is not entirely understood, but the acceleration of the =
Greenland ice=20
        sheet suggests yet another feedback mechanism: once an ice sheet =
begins=20
        to melt, it starts to flow faster, which means it also thins out =
faster,=20
        encouraging further melt. Not far from Swiss Camp, there is a =
huge river=20
        of ice known as the Jakobshavn Isbrae, which probably was the =
source of=20
        the iceberg that sank the Titanic. In 1992, the Jakobshavn =
Isbrae flowed=20
        at a rate of three and a half miles per year; by 2003, its =
velocity had=20
        increased to 7.8 miles per year. Similar findings were announced =
earlier=20
        this year by scientists measuring the flow of ice streams on the =

        Antarctic Peninsula.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last century, global sea =
levels have=20
        risen by about half a foot. The most recent report of the UN's=20
        Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, issued in 2001, =
predicts that=20
        they will rise anywhere from four inches to three feet by the =
year 2100.=20
        This prediction includes almost no contribution from Greenland =
or=20
        Antarctica; it is based mostly on the physics of water, which, =
as it=20
        warms up, expands. Two climatologists at Pennsylvania State =
University,=20
        Richard Alley and Byron Parizek, recently issued new predictions =
that=20
        take into account the observed acceleration of the ice sheets; =
this=20
        effect in Greenland alone, they estimate, will cause up to two =
and half=20
        inches of additional sea-level rise over the coming century. =
James=20
        Hansen, the NASA official who directed one of the initial=20
        nineteen-seventies studies on the effects of carbon dioxide, has =
gone=20
        much further, arguing that if greenhouse-gas emissions are not=20
        controlled the total disintegration of the Greenland ice sheet =
could be=20
        set in motion in a matter of decades. Although the process would =
take=20
        hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years to fully play out, once =
begun it=20
        would become self-reinforcing, and hence virtually impossible to =
stop.=20
        In an article published earlier last year in the journal =
Climatic=20
        Change, Hansen, who is now the head of the Goddard Institute for =
Space=20
        Studies, wrote that he hoped he was wrong about the ice sheet, =
"but I=20
        doubt it."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it happened, I was at Swiss Camp =
just as=20
        last summer's global-warming disaster movie, "The Day After =
Tomorrow,"=20
        was opening in theatres. One night, Steffen's wife called on the =
camp's=20
        satellite phone to say that she had just taken the couple's two =
teen-age=20
        children to see it. Everyone had enjoyed the film, she reported, =

        especially because of the family connection.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fantastic conceit of "The Day =
After=20
        Tomorrow" is that global warming produces global freezing. At =
the start=20
        of the film, a chunk of Antarctic ice the size of Rhode Island =
suddenly=20
        melts. (Something very similar to this actually happened in =
March, 2002,=20
        when the Larsen B ice shelf collapsed.) Most of what follows - =
an=20
        instant ice age, cyclonic winds that descend from the upper =
atmosphere -=20
        is impossible as science but not as metaphor. The record =
preserved in=20
        the Greenland ice sheet shows that over the last hundred =
thousand years=20
        temperatures have often swung wildly - so often that it is our =
own=20
        relatively static experience of climate that has come to look=20
        exceptional. Nobody knows what caused the sudden climate shifts =
of the=20
        past; however, many climatologists suspect that they had =
something to do=20
        with changes in ocean-current patterns that are known as the=20
        thermohaline circulation.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you freeze sea ice, the salt is =
pushed=20
        out of the pores, so that the salty water actually drains," =
Steffen=20
        explained to me one day when we were standing out on the ice, =
trying to=20
        talk above the howl of the wind. "And salty water's actually =
heavier, so=20
        it starts to sink." Meanwhile, owing both to evaporation and to =
heat=20
        loss, water from the tropics becomes denser as it drifts toward =
the=20
        Arctic, so that near Greenland a tremendous volume of seawater =
is=20
        constantly sinking toward the ocean floor. As a result of this =
process,=20
        still more warm water is drawn from the tropics toward the =
poles,=20
        setting up what is often referred to as a "conveyor belt" that =
moves=20
        heat around the globe.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the energy engine for the =
world=20
        climate," Steffen went on. "And it has one source: the water =
that sinks=20
        down. And if you just turn the knob here a little bit" - he made =
a=20
        motion of turning the water on in a bathtub - "we can expect =
significant=20
        temperature changes based on the redistribution of energy." One =
way to=20
        turn the knob is to heat the oceans, which is already happening. =
Another=20
        is to pour more freshwater into the polar seas. This is also =
occurring.=20
        Not only is runoff from coastal Greenland increasing; the volume =
of=20
        river discharge into the Arctic Ocean has been rising. =
Oceanographers=20
        monitoring the North Atlantic have documented that in recent =
decades its=20
        waters have become significantly less salty. A total shutdown of =
the=20
        thermohaline circulation is considered extremely unlikely in the =
coming=20
        century. But, if the Greenland ice sheet started to =
disintegrate, the=20
        possibility of such a shutdown could not be ruled out. Wallace =
Broecker,=20
        a professor of geochemistry at Columbia University's =
Lamont-Doherty=20
        Earth Observatory, has labeled the thermohaline circulation the=20
        "Achilles' heel of the climate system." Were it to halt, places =
like=20
        Britain, whose climate is heavily influenced by the Gulf Stream, =
could=20
        become much colder, even as the planet as a whole continued to =
warm up.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the whole time I was at Swiss =
Camp, it=20
        was "polar day," and so the sun never set. Dinner was generally =
served=20
        at 10 or 11 p.m., and afterward everyone sat around a makeshift =
table in=20
        the kitchen, talking and drinking coffee. (Because it is not - =
strictly=20
        speaking - necessary, alcohol was in short supply.) One night, I =
asked=20
        Steffen what he thought conditions at Swiss Camp would be like =
in the=20
        same season a decade hence. "In ten years, the signal should be =
much=20
        more distinct, because we will have added another ten years of=20
        greenhouse warming," he said.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zwally interjected, "I predict that =
ten years=20
        from now we won't be coming this time of year. We won't be able =
to come=20
        this late. To put it nicely, we are heading into deep doo-doo."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either by disposition or by training, =
Steffen=20
        was reluctant to make specific predictions, whether about =
Greenland or,=20
        more generally, about the Arctic. Often, he prefaced his remarks =
by=20
        noting that there could be a change in atmospheric-circulation =
patterns=20
        that would dampen the rate of temperature increase or even - =
temporarily=20
        at least - reverse it entirely. But he was emphatic that =
"climate change=20
        is a real thing.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not something dramatic now - =
that's why=20
        people don't really react," he told me. "But if you can convey =
the=20
        message that it will be dramatic for our children and our =
children's=20
        children - the risk is too big not to care."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time, he added, "is already five =
past=20
        midnight."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last night that I spent at =
Swiss Camp,=20
        Steffen took the data he had downloaded off his weather station =
and,=20
        after running them through various programs on his laptop, =
produced the=20
        mean temperature at the camp for the previous year. It was the =
highest=20
        of any year since the camp was built.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, dinner was unusually =
late. On the=20
        return trip of another pole-drilling expedition, one of the =
snowmobiles=20
        had caught on fire, and had to be towed back to camp. When I =
finally=20
        went out to my tent to go to bed, I found that the snow =
underneath it=20
        had started to melt, and there was a large puddle in the middle =
of the=20
        floor. I got some paper towels and tried to mop it up, but the =
puddle=20
        was too big, and eventually I gave up.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No nation takes a keener interest in =
climate=20
        change, at least on a per-capita basis, than Iceland. More than =
ten per=20
        cent of the country is covered by glaciers, the largest of =
which,=20
        Vatnaj=C3=B6kull, stretches over thirty-two hundred square =
miles. During the=20
        so-called Little Ice Age, the advance of the glaciers caused =
widespread=20
        misery; it has been estimated that in the mid-eighteenth century =
nearly=20
        a third of the country's population died of starvation or =
associated=20
        ills. For Icelanders, many of whom can trace their genealogy =
back a=20
        thousand years, this is considered to be almost recent history.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oddur Sigurdsson heads up a group =
called the=20
        Icelandic Glaciological Society. One day last fall, I went to =
visit him=20
        in his office, at the headquarters of Iceland's National Energy=20
        Authority, in Reykjav=C3=ADk. Little towheaded children kept =
wandering in to=20
        peer under his desk. Sigurdsson explained that Reykjav=C3=ADk's =
public=20
        schoolteachers were on strike, and his colleagues had had to =
bring their=20
        children to work.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Icelandic Glaciological Society =
is=20
        composed entirely of volunteers. Every fall, after the =
summer-melt=20
        season has ended, they survey the size of the country's three=20
        hundred-odd glaciers and then file reports, which Sigurdsson =
collects in=20
        brightly colored binders. In the organization's early years - it =
was=20
        founded in 1930 - the volunteers were mostly farmers; they took=20
        measurements by building cairns and pacing off the distance to =
the=20
        glacier's edge. These days, members come from all walks of life =
- one is=20
        a retired plastic surgeon - and they take more exacting surveys, =
using=20
        tape measures and iron poles. Some glaciers have been in the =
same=20
        family, so to speak, for generations. Sigurdsson became head of =
the=20
        society in 1987, at which point one volunteer told him that he =
thought=20
        he would like to relinquish his post.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was about ninety when I realized =
how old=20
        he was," Sigurdsson recalled. "His father had done this at that =
place=20
        before and then his nephew took over for him." Another volunteer =
has=20
        been monitoring his glacier, a section of Vatnaj=C3=B6kull, =
since 1948. "He's=20
        eighty," Sigurdsson said. "And if I have some questions that go =
beyond=20
        his age I just go and ask his mother. She's a hundred and =
seven."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to glaciers in North =
America,=20
        which have been shrinking steadily since the nineteen-sixties, =
Iceland's=20
        glaciers grew through the nineteen-seventies and eighties. Then, =
in the=20
        mid-nineteen-nineties, they, too, began to decline, at first =
slowly and=20
        then much more rapidly. Sigurdsson pulled out a notebook of=20
        glaciological reports, filled out on yellow forms, and turned to =
the=20
        section on a glacier called S=C3=B3lheimaj=C3=B6kull, a =
tongue-shaped spit of ice=20
        that sticks out from a much larger glacier, called =
My=C2=B4rdalsj=C3=B6kull. In=20
        1996, S=C3=B3lheimaj=C3=B6kull crept back by ten feet. In 1997, =
it receded by=20
        another thirty-three feet, and in 1998 by ninety-eight feet. =
Every year=20
        since then, it has retreated even more. In 2003, it shrank by =
three=20
        hundred and two feet and in 2004 by two hundred and eighty-five =
feet.=20
        All told, S=C3=B3lheimaj=C3=B6kull - the name means "sun-home =
glacier" and refers=20
        to a nearby farm - is now eleven hundred feet shorter than it =
was just a=20
        decade ago. Sigurdsson pulled out another notebook, which was =
filled=20
        with slides. He picked out some recent ones of =
S=C3=B3lheimaj=C3=B6kull. The=20
        glacier ended in a wide river. An enormous rock, which =
S=C3=B3lheimaj=C3=B6kull=20
        had deposited when it began its retreat, stuck out from the =
water, like=20
        the hull of an abandoned ship.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can tell by this glacier what =
the=20
        climate is doing," Sigurdsson said. "It is more sensitive than =
the most=20
        sensitive meteorological measurement." He introduced me to a =
colleague=20
        of his, Kristjana Eyth=C3=B3rsd=C3=B3ttir, who, as it turned =
out, was the=20
        granddaughter of the founder of the Icelandic Glaciological =
Society.=20
        Eyth=C3=B3rsd=C3=B3ttir keeps tabs on a glacier named =
Leidarj=C3=B6kull, which is a=20
        four-hour trek from the nearest road. I asked her how it was =
doing. "Oh,=20
        it's getting smaller and smaller, just like all the others," she =
said.=20
        Sigurdsson told me that climate models predicted that by the end =
of the=20
        next century Iceland would be virtually ice-free. "We will have =
small=20
        ice caps on the highest mountains, but the mass of the glaciers =
will=20
        have gone," he said. It is believed that there have been =
glaciers on=20
        Iceland for the last few million years. "Probably longer," =
Sigurdsson=20
        said.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October, 2000, in a middle school =
in=20
        Barrow, Alaska, officials from the eight Arctic nations - the =
US,=20
        Russia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland - =
met to=20
        talk about global warming. The group announced plans for a =
three-part,=20
        two-million-dollar study of climate change in the region. This =
past=20
        fall, the first two parts of the study - a massive technical =
document=20
        and a hundred-and-forty-page summary - were presented at a =
symposium in=20
        Reykjav=C3=ADk.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day after I went to talk to =
Sigurdsson, I=20
        attended the symposium's plenary session. In addition to nearly =
three=20
        hundred scientists, it drew a sizable contingent of native =
Arctic=20
        residents - reindeer herders, subsistence hunters, and =
representatives=20
        of groups like the Inuvialuit Game Council. In among the shirts =
and=20
        ties, I spotted two men dressed in the brightly colored tunics =
of the=20
        Sami and several others wearing sealskin vests. As the session =
went on,=20
        the subject kept changing - from hydrology and biodiversity to =
fisheries=20
        and on to forests. The message, however, stayed the same. Almost =

        wherever you looked, temperatures in the Arctic were rising, and =
at a=20
        rate that surprised even those who had expected to find clear =
signs of=20
        climate change. Robert Corell, an American oceanographer and a =
former=20
        assistant director at the National Science Foundation, =
coordinated the=20
        study. In his opening remarks, he ran through its findings - =
shrinking=20
        sea ice, receding glaciers, thawing permafrost - and summed them =
up as=20
        follows: "The Arctic climate is warming rapidly now, with an =
emphasis on=20
        now." Particularly alarming, Corell said, were the most recent =
data from=20
        Greenland, which showed the ice sheet melting much faster "than =
we=20
        thought possible even a decade ago."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global warming is routinely described =
as a=20
        matter of scientific debate - a theory whose validity has yet to =
be=20
        demonstrated. This characterization, or at least a variant of =
it, is=20
        offered most significantly by the Bush Administration, which =
maintains=20
        that there is still insufficient scientific understanding to =
justify=20
        mandatory action. The symposium's opening session lasted for =
more than=20
        nine hours. During that time, many speakers stressed the =
uncertainties=20
        that remain about global warming and its effects - on the =
thermohaline=20
        circulation, on the distribution of vegetation, on the survival =
of=20
        cold-loving species, on the frequency of forest fires. But this =
sort of=20
        questioning, which is so basic to scientific discourse, never =
extended=20
        to the relationship between carbon dioxide and rising =
temperatures. The=20
        study's executive summary stated, unequivocally, that human =
beings had=20
        become the "dominant factor" influencing the climate. During an=20
        afternoon coffee break, I caught up with Corell. "Let's say that =
there's=20
        three hundred people in this room," he told me. "I don't think =
you'll=20
        find five who would say that global warming is just a natural =
process."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part of the Arctic-climate =
study,=20
        which was still unfinished at the time of the symposium, was the =

        so-called "policy document." This was supposed to outline =
practical=20
        steps to be taken in response to the scientific findings, =
including -=20
        presumably - reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. The policy =
document=20
        remained unfinished because American negotiators had rejected =
much of=20
        the language proposed by the seven other Arctic nations. (A few =
weeks=20
        later, the US agreed to a vaguely worded statement calling for=20
        "effective" - but not obligatory - actions to combat the =
problem.) This=20
        recalcitrance left those Americans who had traveled to =
Reykjav=C3=ADk in an=20
        awkward position. A few tried - halfheartedly - to defend the=20
        Administration's stand to me; most, including many government =
employees,=20
        were critical of it. At one point, Corell observed that the loss =
of sea=20
        ice since the late nineteen-seventies was equal to "the size of =
Texas=20
        and Arizona combined. That analogy was made for obvious =
reasons."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That evening, at the hotel bar, I =
talked to=20
        an Inuit hunter named John Keogak, who lives on Banks Island, in =

        Canada's Northwest Territories, some five hundred miles north of =
the=20
        Arctic Circle. He told me that he and his fellow-hunters had =
started to=20
        notice that the climate was changing in the mid-eighties. A few =
years=20
        ago, for the first time, people began to see robins, a bird for =
which=20
        the Inuit in his region have no word.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just thought, Oh, gee, it's =
warming up a=20
        little bit," he recalled. "It was good at the start - warmer =
winters,=20
        you know - but now everything is going so fast. The things that =
we saw=20
        coming in the early nineties, they've just multiplied.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of the people involved in global =
warming, I=20
        think we're on top of the list of who would be most affected," =
Keogak=20
        went on. "Our way of life, our traditions, maybe our families. =
Our=20
        children may not have a future. I mean, all young people, put it =
that=20
        way. It's just not happening in the Arctic. It's going to happen =
all=20
        over the world. The whole world is going too fast."=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symposium in Reykjav=C3=ADk =
lasted for four=20
        days. One morning, when the presentations on the agenda included =
"Char=20
        as a Model for Assessing Climate Change Impacts on Arctic =
Fishery=20
        Resources," I decided to rent a car and take a drive. In recent =
years,=20
        Reykjav=C3=ADk has been expanding almost on a daily basis, and =
the old port=20
        city is now surrounded by rings of identical, European-looking =
suburbs.=20
        Ten minutes from the car-rental place, these began to give out, =
and I=20
        found myself in a desolate landscape in which there were no =
trees or=20
        bushes or really even soil. The ground - fields of lava from =
some=20
        defunct, or perhaps just dormant, volcanoes - resembled macadam =
that had=20
        recently been bulldozed. I stopped to get a cup of coffee in the =
town of=20
        Hveragerdi, where roses are raised in greenhouses heated with =
steam that=20
        pours directly out of the earth. Farther on, I crossed into farm =

        country; the landscape was still treeless, but now there was =
grass, and=20
        sheep eating it. Finally, I reached the sign for =
S=C3=B3lheimaj=C3=B6kull, the=20
        glacier whose retreat Oddur Sigurdsson had described to me. I =
turned off=20
        onto a dirt road. It ran alongside a brown river, between two =
crazily=20
        shaped ridges. After a few miles, the road ended, and the only =
option=20
        was to continue on foot.=20
        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time I got to the lookout over =

        S=C3=B3lheimaj=C3=B6kull, it was raining. In the gloomy light, =
the glacier looked=20
        forlorn. Much of it was gray - covered in a film of dark grit. =
In its=20
        retreat, it had left behind ridged piles of silt. These were jet =
black=20
        and barren - not even the tough local grasses had had a chance =
to take=20
        root on them. I looked for the enormous boulder I had seen in =
the photos=20
        in Sigurdsson's office. It was such a long way from the edge of =
the=20
        glacier that for a moment I wondered if perhaps it had been =
carried=20
        along by the current. A raw wind came up, and I started to head =
down.=20
        Then I thought about what Sigurdsson had told me. If I returned =
in=20
        another decade, the glacier would probably no longer even be =
visible=20
        from the ridge where I was standing. I climbed back up to take a =
second=20
        look. </P>[an error occurred while processing this directive]=20
