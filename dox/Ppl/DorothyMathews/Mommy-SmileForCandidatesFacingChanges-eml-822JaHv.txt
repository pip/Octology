Thanks Mommy,

That's cute but it agitates me more than it tickles.  Call me too realistic
or cynical or passionate or idealistic or misguided or impatient or
whatever... but the only "change" I expect from those folks is etchings on
the next placard as another puppet of oppressive status quo, parroting the
verbiage that their measurements decipher as most resonant.  Popular
leadership has degenerated to such banal manipulation of language &&
indoctrination into cultural blindness, unwavering allegiance,
self-assuredness, hypocrisy, brutality, elitism.  I hate governance.  These
systems are evil.  Mincing words is the specialty (i.e., secret deadly weapon)
of these legalists.  Implying the "change" they are certain to achieve
actually resembles both what most citizens already know they'd like to see
accomplished && simultaneously those things that are best for us that we
don't largely know about yet (even when the two diverge), is rich && bitter.
It's especially unpalatable to me when the "change" they've claimed to
experience, internalize, && precipitate has been precisely *not* the "change"
that would minimize war, legislate freedom reasonably, or manage complexity
elegantly.  Groomed facades are our simultaneous icons of ongoing hope &&
captivity.  We broadcast our dishonor when our society perennially dons the
"angry mob" persona to wage yet another bloody war against some concocted
modern hybrid of savages, scarecrows, witches, && phantoms.  The pure actual
root war has always been obscured by the wicked.  It is the underlying fight
for or against fear itself.  The cowards wield their dominance to redefine
themselves && all they do as the new "brave."  Righteous are slain && wicked
prosper in their artificial kingdoms.  When will our purportedly United States
see that other cultures have always been the greatness we've claimed credit
for && been inspired by, so selecting targets among them to hate && kill is
ultimately suicidal, no matter how it plays out?  I know to the undiscerning,
the easily distracted && misled, it sounds like I too "hate" the majority of
people in the world for being so stupid to demand or condone existing
governance... but my attitude, even if similar, is categorically distinct
because mine does not wish to initiate any physical harm against massive
people groups who have not first attacked others (&& I especially don't want
them dead!).  Compassion, encouragement, generosity, genuineness, honesty,
courage, vigor, etc. (&& even when these roads are much more uncomfortable &&
challenging to navigate), these are not the hallmarks of "hatred" made
manifest.  Damn, I sure am severe sometimes! ;)

I hope you're having a good weekend, Maga.  Thanks for the link.  I know you
meant it for levity && are distressed to imagine such dementia which must
cause me to pervert creative editing which was designed to soothe into
something metaphorically searing.  I appreciate the creative editor.  I
appreciate the politicians that don't require a team of analysts always
determining what they must next say && do.  I appreciate the constant
opportunity for real changes that end wars && stem sorrows... even if each so
far has been squandered.  I try to enjoy the manicured surfaces but the
dreadfully sinister lurks in the deep, && my farsightedness brings the latter
into more vivid focus, almost to the exclusion of the former.  Maybe a
minority of the living have great depth (either sky or sea for these purposes)
which imbues deep sight... but the majority cannot discern because their
typical focal depth falls off so proximately && abruptly that they proliferate
beliefs (which are concertedly surfaced from the deceptive depths) that
suggest farseeing doesn't && cannot exist.  What can I do, Maga?  This is how
I see.

I love you.  Have a good night && I hope we can chat again soon. =)

Love,
-Pip
