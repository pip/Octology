Hey Maga,
  I know I may have gotten a little dogmatic a week ago with the
Linux-rant but I was trying to inform you... I hope it didn't seem like I
was too snooty, like patronizing or "but-of-course" about it all.  I want
to be capable of clearly presenting the beneficial facets of open-source
software in most arenas.  I would like to be eloquent && convincing
regarding issues that clearly will have a massive impact on the future of
human-machine interaction.  Along those lines && on a more hotly debated
issue, I was hoping you && I could calmly (at our convenience) discuss
firearms && personal freedoms.  I know I haven't really confronted you
about it with respect or regard for your opinion before (which
probably was scary for both of us)... even it may have initially been a
sort of rebellious "I make my own choices now" sort of move on my behalf
in the first place (&& the video games too?  We can talk about that
one later) && ... well I would rather not place or leave myself at odds
with you if possible.  Maybe I won't change my stance on 2nd-Amendment
rights (&& maybe you won't either) but I think it would be healthy for the
two of us to discuss our positions && come to terms with why the other
has such opinions.  Now I don't want you to think I'm trying to face
off with you either (or manipulate you selfishly like Dad) ... I'd rather
you understand that I am respecting you && your opinion more... I care
enormously about you && what you think of me.  I want you to understand
who I am, what I do, what I want to do, even what I think.  I'm not in a
terrible hurry... I just would like to develop a closer && more mature
relationship with you, my wonderful mother, whom I adore.
  Now, in preparation, this discussion might become heated at some points
&& even a bit ugly (as seen from an observer if there were one) but I'd
like us to basically shake hands that this is an okay && fine thing for us
to do (sorta like the full-nelson wrestling of old).  We might be so busy
that we won't get to write too much to each other (possibly even for
weeks) or the discussion might change course to any other issues or topics
(moral, political, technical, whatever...) but I am just longing to engage
you intellectually && to reassure you that I am me && I'm not trying to go
anywhere without your love.  This might be all sentimental && stuff
too... even the increasing pressure from Dad is forcing me to recognize
how precious my time with my beloved family is... that we are here for
each other... that we do love each other so dearly... that we're far apart
&& rarely near enough.  It was wonderful hearing Aunt Ginny && Uncle Dan's
voices this week... && Emmash prolly 6-feet tall =).  I'm sorry if this is
a huge cry for help... please don't be too scared... I'm trying to be calm
about it all too... feel free to talk even to Ginny or whoever you
trust... I trust them wholly too... Dad is getting crazier && he's
... well it's very dangerous for me that I'm am the only thing left in his
insane mind.  All of his efforts && expressions && creativity && reprimand
&& instruction && violence && coaxing && gentleness && patience &&
stringence are welling up.  I'm just being very long winded in trying to
say "I LOVE you Mom!"... more than I can say.  I love Angie so much
too... I've hurt her && Tim && I've been an asshole in so many ways.  Even
when I've been forgiven && I try to forgive myself, I hate the damage &&
pain that I have brought... the things I never should have done or
said.  You two are so far away.  I miss you both terribly.  I don't know
Rosie as well as I'd like.  I had really hoped that she would feel
comfortable enough to open up to us kids more over the winter... time ran
short (largely my fault)... I don't know what I could've expected
but... even that made me feel like a jerk.  I've been so self-absorbed
that I couldn't abridge my life story enough to let everyone else
share.  Time pressures suck.  Well anyway, I trust && immediately accept
your choices so I love Rosie too but I would like to know you all
more.  I tried to get Tim to come down && go snowboarding with me today
but I didn't hear back.  It sounded like he had a few papers to do this
week.  I hope he did well.  My roommies are trudging through midterms &&
stuff now too =).  Oh... I haven't heard back from the bankruptcy
attorney (Roy Berry)  but I left him a message saying that "my Mom" would
like to be included in any further discussions of a bankruptcy
filing.  I'm sorry I may have blown it so badly with Fish.  I didn't
imagine how costly it could be && even that he could lie so cruelly just
to take money from me.  The most damning (yet unsubstantiated) accusation
was that I held his server, passwords, && code hostage until he could
be convinced to pay me some exorbitant ransom.  It was completely imagined
&& I was given no opportunity to retort.  The arbitration is particularly 
binding (unless I can demonstrate fraud, collusion, etc.) && my attorney
said that it would cost more to try to overturn it in a real lawsuit than 
to just pay the 15k.  I am so thankful that you are willing to rescue
me... I'm trying to grow && mature but sometimes it's berry harb.  I was
scared by the possibilities of Y2K && lost faith in credit && people.  I
had no credit card to repair my own Jeep with on my way to Wisconsin.  How
foolish?  Since then, I've had 3 real credit cards && a Chevron card && I
have been very diligent about balances... I've built excellent
credit... my limits are probably about half of 15k... I've never maxed any
&& always pay them all off immediately so I'm not even sure what my total
limit is but I do get offered new platinum cards several times each
week.  I know we'll work it out... Thank you for saving my skin here if
you can... I feel like I'm coming home again && telling you "I broke your
car" && you're replying   "Yep.  You sure did.  You'll have to pay me
back."  "I will."  Thank you for being there for me Mom.  I hope that I'm
there for you whenever you need me (once I can stop getting into my own
troubles).  You are so strong.  I love you.  Please give big hugs &&
kisses to Angie && Rosie && tell them that I think of my 3 Wis-Women often
&& miss each of you.
  So... how do you feel about the 2nd-Amendment && why?  Talk amongst
yaselves... I'm a little vahclempt. =)

With Unconditional Love,
-Philip

ps. In hindsight, it seems I should write this letter on paper as that
experience, on both ends, is naturally more personal && meaningful... but
I feel some urgency (hopefully misplaced).  Email is not private either
but it is fast.  I guess I'll do both.
Please take && give my love. =)
