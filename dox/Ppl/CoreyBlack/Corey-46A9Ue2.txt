Hey Corey,

  I just found out yesterday that you've been collecting bill money
from Mike && I but you haven't paid any of our bills in months.
You even called me earlier this week telling me to pay you for the
current bills when you probably had no intention of paying those
either.  You have been lying to your roommates.  You have not acted
with integrity.  You should have told us the truth if you cared to
be respectful as a man or even moreso if there was any friendship
you valued.

  From the moment you met me, && particularly before we moved into
this house, you knew how important cable Internet service is to me.
I wanted it in my name in the first place.  Now it seems you've let
the service be disconnected without any notice.  Worse than that,
because you haven't paid any bills, Mike && I may have great
difficulty in establishing our own service.

  It is not too late to fix this situation && redeem yourself.  I
suggest you find a way to pay the bills that you owe so that your
credit is not harmed any more && Mike && I can get electricity &&
cable.  You have lied && betrayed us for months.  Please do what it
takes to make things right before you go.

  I have written this letter in hopes that you have some respect
for yourself && for Mike && I.  We would appreciate it if you would
fix this problem you've brought upon us.  I must admit it is
difficult for me to extend you this much grace && kindness right
now when I've come home from 60 hours straight of working my ass off
to find no Internet service at home with no warning.  Pay your bills
&& leave in peace... or go ahead && say "I don't give a fuck" but
remember this: Even after you lied && stole bill money from Mike &&
Pip, Pip wrote you this letter trying to respect you... trying to
give you some undeserved dignity.  You can choose to be a stand-up
guy yourself.  I hope you will.

your roommate,
-Pip
