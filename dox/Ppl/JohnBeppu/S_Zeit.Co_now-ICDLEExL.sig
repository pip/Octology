It's a nice way you can get free hosting for either static content, a node.js application, or a Docker container.

Oooh! Maybe Octology could nest in a Docker container for Pip@GHub && GG stuff could be static or node.js by GuyGooway somewhere else, although I was thinking maybe just the best most Perl-friendly short paste-bins might be best for tossing around rather anonymized snippets of GG texts. Cool. Much to look into && improve ahead.

They have the `now.sh` domain that you're free to put subdomains on assuming no one else has taken the subdomain you want.  That saves you from having to register a domain name.

Looking through their examples is probably the easiest way to get started:  https://zeit.co/examples/

One caveat about the docker stuff.  It's only supported in v1 of their platform, and they just recently moved over to v2.  https://zeit.co/docs/v1/deployment-types/docker/

I've only successfully used v1 so far for node.js applications.

v2 had a lot of problems when they released it, so a lot of people are still using v1.

Once you've read J99.. and the 3 smaller .*.. files, you can ask any questions, give any suggestions, && arrange best method 2 sync 2 l8st. Cool. I will check S_Zeit.Co 4 Now.Sh subs. My downstairs neighbor is having problems typing on his phone, so I'm gonna head down to help him for a bit, but I'll probably be back on Sig as soon as I head back up. We might puff a bit.  ;)

I showed the Kensington Slim Blade off yesterday, and it was a hit with everyone (even Mac people (which was everyone but me)).

For pointer movement, it feels very precise.  I'm still getting used to the twisty scroll.  It's not as fast as the old jog dial.  However, it has a way better sound.  (The jog dial of the old Kensington may be faster and easier to flick, but it makes a horrible rattly sound.)

The dual lasers on the Blade also stay clean fresh base hole more than old Expert. It was good in its own way.

I just put They Might Be Giants CDs in my car 6-disc and hooked up PS2 in living room big TV with sticks if anyone wants either that or SoulCaliVI after HuHot. Might try to pick up another SC2 or 3 since some shitty guest stole mine, but I still have a few good mem-card deep saves!  ;)

They used to turn a blind eye, but the legal situation in America makes leveraged trading hard to do legally.  I think forex traders may have similar difficulties.
