Hello Beppu-san. I hope you are doing okay. I maybe no longer will be. I've attempted to rsync a lot of my l8st best code, d8a-files, && document8ion here to
  your BavL.Org / MetaNotes site, since I figured my most important files shouldn't take up too much valuable space here && you ought to eventually stand a
  good chance of finding this all here eventually, even if we aren't able to reach each other again any other way. I might be forced out of my apartment in
  Oshkosh here on Monday (Oct. 19th, 2020)... or shortly thereafter. My landlord and neighbors might lie together about me && then steal all my belongings to
  enrich themselves. There might be little left to stop (or even slow) them. Hopefully things don't turn out so dire, && I can stay home with Darjeeling &&
  my stuff until I find another decent place to live. If that starts seeming likely, I'll try to remember to come delete this file, as worries that weren't
  ever needed (thankfully!), but it's going up here for now because my predicaments are starting to look potentially pretty bleak && dire here. I hope almost
  no matter what happens, that you survive && eventually thrive, despite whatever may become of me. I plan to never give up living && fighting && being! <3
