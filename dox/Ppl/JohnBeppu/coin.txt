I7KMCoin: HTTPS://YouTube.Com/channel/UCBaU9NXRPjkLGgJy-M7RPCw/playlists probably has 7 good TechAnalysis lessons by CryptoCred which I should study l8r.
  Also `ssh -N -T -R22222:localhost:22 pip@MetaNotes.Com -Cv` should crE8 a reverse tunnel out of Aku so that Beppu-san or I can l8r get back from elsewhere.
  HTTPS://Unix.StackExchange.Com/questions/46235/how-does-reverse-ssh-tunneling-work should describe the process && options well, which Beppu-san utilized;
I7BMBitC:So needed to Show Addresses in Electrum 3.2.2 default_wallet then copy top receiving address over to priv8 message to Beppu-san in Slack.
  He used it to transfer ~0.02 BitCoin to me which then provided a link to BlockTrail.Com to show the status of "unconfirmed", which may take several minutes
  to go through; Next he wanted to show me how HTTPS://ShapeShift.IO can anonymize amounts through Monero; For the transfer of ~0.02, the rel8ively fixed cost
  from SegWit to SegWit was ~`q 0.00001905x6350` = ~$0.12cents as fee, which is probably mostly a function of the BitCoin price but is something maybe we will
  want to study more l8r. Beppu-san used HTTPS://MyMonero.Com to crE8 a new account with priv8 login key to make a new wallet. Sometimes ShapeShift doesn't
  work correctly (gets 500 errors && can't even talk with itself). Another altern8ive is HTTPS://XMR.To which is way simpler && only do Monero to BTC. Our
  goal to anonymize is to do Monero to Monero to break chain of identity. For alts, maybe HTTPS://Binance.Com is better than HTTPS://BitTREx.Com (where he is
  still downloading price d8a from). If I make an account on Binance, probably shouldn't use my real identity && forego 2-factor authentic8ion. They also have
  integr8d TradingView for visualizing price d8a (which is Bep's preference). BNB is their own coin for lower trading fees. XMR is the code for Monero though.
  For clearing out MyMonero to BitCoin through XMR.To, you need to calcul8 fees && the exchange r8 to determine the exact amount of target BTC for the result.
  There was a bad error message for XMR.To because BTC only supported up to 8 decimal places. My chart is at HTTPS://TradingView.Com/chart/FkLhBiaO for l8r.
  If I don't mind my identity being assoC8d, there's also Gemini && CoinBase to buy BTC with USD. Also study BabyPips.Com && make an account on Expo.IO for
  l8r publishing any upd8s to React_n8ive d8ok code so Beppu-san can check it out too; Study HTTP://LopP.Net/bitcoin.html && take notes to learn more details;

We did setup NodeBrew && got the l8st node v10.6.0 setup to then enable install8ion of React_n8ive && then watchman for `npm start` to sometimes work for
  hot-loading project upd8s in ~/dvl/t8/rn8v/d8st/ before doing `npm i -g exp` which allowed us to instead use `exp start` there more consistently. I think
  we did something like `npm install --save react-native` originally inside the project to just load into the local node_modules/ directory;
