<center><h4>Pertinant Fish vs. Stuart Emails</h4></center><br>
<p>This document extracts the most descriptive emails from the
salvageable email history between Fish &amp;&amp; Stuart available
at <a href="http://BinQ.org/800tele/lenemail.txt">
http://BinQ.org/800tele/lenemail.txt</a>.  I've commented after each
section.  They should also be in relatively chronological order except
when multiple attachments are included in the same section.  Then they
will be latest to earliest for that section. Basically the deeper the
arrow ( <b>&gt;</b> ) indented nesting level is, the earlier the mail
was.  Hopefully this is a good summary for what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. Fish hired me to setup && administer a webserver.  We initially
agreed that I would be paid $32 / hour for any work I did which
sounded fine to me since I had assumed I would be able to work like
a normal employee for 40+ hours each week.  Mr. Fish had a falling out
with his original programmer (Vijay) before the project had even begun
so he replaced "Vijay" with "Pip" in the text of his contract && had me
take over the development. The project was to enhance an already
supposedly "robust" open source e-commerce system called OpenMerchant.
He didn't want to hire me as an employee and had suggested I be a
contractor (which I had never done before).  I was wiling to try if we
could agree on something fair.  The above email is so telling.  I wanted
to be treated fairly.  Mr. Fish's first offer was for a measly $500 per
week.  I should have looked for work elsewhere at that clear sign that
his aims were to pay as unfairly as possible.  We bickered about the
agreement from the beginning.</p>

<p>The only invoice (ie. the only week I [nearly] fulfilled the contract).
Also the only time I did "a good job".  There were no other invoices
because everything became vague && verbal once we ditched OpenMerchant
&amp;&amp; the originally signed agreement during the third week.</p>

<p>Clearly we had discussed ditching OpenMerchant at this time.  Mr. Fish had
already written version 0.9.6 off && was incapable of comprehending the
abbrev. of 0.9.6 to simply 9.6 for pre-release development.  The 1.0 release
happened with a name change to AllCommerce (from OpenMerchant).  I had tried
for weeks to get 0.7.4 && 0.9.6 to work correctly on the server.  I was
unsuccessful && was getting farther behind as a result so we decided to
discard OpenMerchant right before they released AllCommerce 1.0 (which
probably wasn't any better than 0.9.6 of OM).  Anyway, the above mail is
basically the most relevant of all as it acknowledges the fact that I was
preparing to reimplement the core functionality of OM from scratch since
there was no other way for me to fulfill the contract (I couldn't get OM
to work by itself, much less enhance it for Mr. Fish's purposes).</p>

The next day, I'd obviously spent a great deal of time implementing a
permission system for accessing database elements && dynamic pages.
These were functions that OM was supposed to handle for us.

<p>This is an incredible example of Mr. Fish's incapacity to comprehend
basic technology.  He saw the lights flickering on his hub && somehow
convinced himself that my computer at my apartment was capable of using
his "isp line" at his home.  My roommate was playing a video game on my
computer while I was away (through the cable modem that all my roommates
share the expense for) && Mr. Fish called && very rudely told him to
stop using my computer.  It was a coincidence that he happened to be
using my computer when Mr. Fish saw his lights flickering.  I did not
leave my computer connected to Mr. Fish's server.  I didn't leave
passwords lying around.  Mr. Fish is still unsure about communications
technology which he so wants to sell.  It's similar to accusing me of
running my refrigerator off his electricity for hours because he's been
monitoring the meter on the side of his house && nobody else knows where
his electrical outlets are.  Mr. Fish is a paranoid idiot.  He imagines
evil hackers are out to steal his wonderful ideas whenever he's not
vigilant enought to monitor his flickering lights of wisdom.  This
episode cause my roommates to hang up on Fish when he'd call &amp;&amp;
they'd give me a hard time for working for such a dunderhead.</p>

<p>I wanted a new agreement reflecting the new programming Fish expected for

<p>I removed the OpenMerchant virtual host && settings from the server since
we weren't going to use them any longer.  I also had a harddrive meltdown

<p>This was another ridiculous situation.  Early on, Mr. Fish asked if I'd
like to work in an office if he were to get one.  I said "Yes if it has
a T1 line."  Weeks later, he shows me his new office && tells me I can
work there && move the server in from his home.  I told him I would when
he bought a T1 line for the office.  Until then, the cable modems the
server && I were connected to were better than the dial-up phone modems
he intended to utilize until he could weasel a deal for some cheap DSL.
He got all upset as if I had chose the office && had promised that I
would work from it && now happily wasted his money by staying at home.
The truth is that he found && rented the office on his own.  I didn't
even see it until he had already excitedly moved his own stuff in.  I
didn't mislead him.  I probably would have worked nights there if he
would have bought a T1 line but he couldn't justify that expenditure so
I couldn't justify leaving my bedroom && cable modem.  It was simple to
me but he wanted to argue about it && got all venomous.  I told him he
wouldn't pay me like an employee so why does he want to dictate my work
conditions && treat me poorly as if I were his subordinate.  He didn't
appreciate that.</p>

<p>Well there's a poignant response on my part.  Mr. Fish is crazy && dealing
with him is nearly impossible.  It's pretty amazing that it took him almost
a month to start treating me badly.  Blatant distrust, insults, arguments,
etc. were what followed.  Most people get the insults && arguments after a
couple days (considering his other relationships I've observed).</p>

<p>Legal threats too.  If it's not yet obvious, I'm a young programmer.  I'm
not a lawyer && cannot afford to hire one.  I don't have savings.  I was
suckered into doing contract work (for the first time) for Fish.  I got
in way over my head && worked as hard as I could to get out but he made
it increasingly impossible for me to do so.</p>

<p>More threats... The "building your own website" he refers to is none
other than this server http://BinQ.org which hasn't changed since I set
it up back then.  You can load the homepage && view the source in your
browser.  It is obviously a trivially simple website with half a page of
html source.  Anything he found out that I was doing other than working
incessantly for him (typically something to keep myself sane because I
was already working on his stuff nearly 80 hours each week) was an
unacceptable "side track".  He wanted a slave.</p>

<p>Fish is an asshole!  I was leaving to be with my brother as he underwent
radiation treatment for Hodgkins Lymphoma in Wisconsin.  Fish knew this
&& still expected me to be primarily concerned with 800Telephone.  This
is about the time when I began to hate this worthless excuse for a man
who calls himself Fish && who treats everyone he encounters poorly
because his own intelligence has been falsely self inflated for the
greater part of a century.  Time && a bit of maturity have enabled me to
harbor less resentment over the whole ordeal... but reliving the old
feelings chronicled in all this email rekindles my anger towards this
wicked man.  I'm tired of thinking about his stupidity.  I'm frustrated
that he was able to treat me so poorly && waste months of my life &&
keep me in this arbitration for almost a year now.  He would be
absolutely nothing in this world if he didn't have money because he
obviously has never learned how to deal with people nicely.  He's so
afraid of being a worthless bitter old man that he is always trying to
prove his compentence && usefulness in things that he knows very little
about.  Fish is just a big old jirk who got lucky with Silly String.
Maybe he'll sue me for using his brand without permission now.  Maybe his
ideas are so old && decrepit that they've already passed into the public
domain.  Oh... woe is Fish when his best ideas are older than all of
today's "young generation".</p>

<p>I needed interfaces to continue but he couldn't hang on to any html
designer since he treated them all too poorly or contested their pay
or both.  He had to basically audit all of my work && then make up
new things to distract me from the fact that I needed interfaces to
make progress.  What he came up with was a massive rewrite of basically
the entire html-embedding structure so that it could be understood by
a "normal" person rather than a typical html coder.  This new focus was
unwarranted && I refused because my system already worked very well &&
even the original agreement made no mention of making the technical
underlying details of the system "simple".  Only the interface had to be
easy which would have been a trivial exercise if he could have hung onto
any competent html developer.</p>

<p>He wanted me to fundamentally alter the entire syntax && parsing rules
which were the assumptions all of my modules were built upon.  I didn't
isolate them in a header file because I never imagined I would be second
guessed or that my decisions would need to be overridden.  There wasn't
any good reason for the rewrite.  I designed && implemented the necessary
functionality.  I was unwilling to rewrite it for an arbitrary &&
unrealistic reason.</p>

July 30, 0 -> Len && Matt

  What are you talking about?  What commitment have I not lived up to?  That 
I let 28 hours go by between our meeting last Wednesday and the time I sent 
you an email?  That I told you that I couldn't werk because you unplugged 
the server?  That I told you that I intended to have something prepared for 
our new agreement next Wednesday night (and Wed. is not here yet)?
  I'm not sure what I'm always deficient in that you think I need to make 
excuses to you but I'm really tired of all this stupidity.  If I have to 
deal with this crap much more (especially with the regularity which you're 
demanding), I'm going to have to quit doing anything for you and let you 
turn it over to whoever you think will accomplish your goals for you.  Maybe 
your goals now include garnishing my wages in the upcoming years.  If that's 
more important to you than finishing this software, you'll at least get a 
shot in court if you keep acting as you have been.
  I don't like dealing with you.  I don't have to anymore.  You should want 
me to continue dealing with you but you don't seem to want me to.  I thought 
I made it clear last week that I'd prefer we each went our separate ways.  
I'm tired of werking for you.  You're tired of my "poor work ethic" and all 
the other innumerable deficiencies you've attributed to me over the past 
months.  You've payed me poorly.  Apparently it's "blackmail" or something 
worse for me to ask to be payed any better going forward.
  Presently, you want me to finish this project.  You're not comprehending 
that I don't want or need to deal with your insanity anymore.  You have one 
more chance to get off my back with all the antagonistic emails before I 
refuse to ever "lift a finger" for you again.  You can sue and whatever will 
happen will happen but if your goal is to get this software written, you are 
sabotaging yourself.
  I'm not really afraid of litigation from you.  At this point, I'd be 
dismayed by the waste of time it would entail for me but (hypothetically) I 
might even be glad to pay you for you to just leave me alone.  I sincerely 
doubt that I would lose any money though after the situation was closely 
examined considering how favorable California laws are toward contractors.
  Now (assuming you're going to be less hostile as an outgrowth of your new 
understanding as to how we are to accomplish anything together), I can send 
you an email every single day (which contains only the number of hours I've 
werked for you) if this is what you need but I will not read email from you 
every day.  We can schedule a meeting once a week.
  I'm am getting well established in my new office and currently have the 
ability to accomplish a lot of werk for both them and you.  Is it worth it 
for me to do so?  Once you answer that question from my perspective (which I 
doubt you're capable of doing), you'll have a grasp on how to handle this.  
Until now, you've really blown it.
  I think it is fair that you unplug the server whenever you feel like it.  
Your paranoia and general fear of things you don't understand (like this 
"young generation") govern your actions and I've grown to accept that a 
server located close to you is not a stable place to develop software.  I 
hope Nataly can accept the same volatility if/when she encounters it.  When 
the server is not accessible, I will not be able to test any code I have 
written.  Please keep that in mind whenever you feel compelled to pull the 
plug and don't pretend that I have lame excuses when I code a lot for you 
and can't even run it only because of you.
  The more I read emails from you the more I think you are the one incapable 
of communicating effectively.  I have been quite clear about many different 
issues in the past and you somehow bumble over the text and only ingest what 
you're hoping for but you entirely omit or misunderstand the key elements.  
The exchange below is characteristic... (in the email sent early Friday 
morning) I state clearly that I'm werking on a new agreement which should be 
ready by "Wednesday" and if it's not done by then, I'll explain why by then. 
  Maybe this is terribly confusing.  Maybe you thought I meant some 
Wednesday in 1963.  Maybe the "Wednesday" when viewed on your screen read 
like "yesterday" or "Friday".  I'm not sure what happened but I am sure that 
I don't think I'm the incapable communicator in our relationship (or what's 
left of it) despite how adamantly you affirm that I am.
  It seems we're playing hardball now.  I like the sport.  I used to be a 
pretty decent 2nd baseman.  It's your turn at the plate.  Sa-wing batta.
  TTFN.

-Pip

p.s. Do you have anything to interject Matt?

Aug. 2, 0 -> Len && Matt

Hello Len,
  I just wanted to make it very clear that I deeply regret the situation we 
have now found ourselves in.  And it is important to point out that the 
waning of my progress on your 800Telephone system was the direct result of 
failure to comply with the agreed financial arrangements between us.  I was 
paid an amount which was significantly less than half of the amount 
described in our original agreement.  In addition, there are many factors 
that were not contemplated under the original agreement.  When we decided 
not to utilize OpenSales, for instance, there was an entire set of 
functionality which I needed to construct from scratch.  This had not been 
detailed or even foreseen in the contract.  I have consistently tried to be 
reasonable and help the project through to finalization and even after you 
had threatened legal action, I was still willing to complete the project if 
we could agree upon a more relaxed schedule since you made it clear that I 
would not be paid any more reasonably for the remainder of development.
  In an effort to show good faith and to help you attain your goals, I had 
persisted on the project, even though it was consuming a lot of my time and 
despite the fact that my living expenses were only narrowly covered by the 
income I was deriving from my work for you.  Ultimately, however, I was 
forced to seek new employment since the project's scope was expanding and 
consuming more hours but the commensurate payments were not forthcoming.  I 
had no other way to support myself.
  Another unfortunate aspect of all this is that when I started employment 
with you, I was enthusiastic about the opportunity to share your vision and 
make it come to life.  However, throughout my work with you, the reality is 
that I have felt consistently abused by you.  You have antagonized and 
insulted me often.  You have implied or explicitly stated that you believe I 
am attempting to cheat you.  Please be clear on this point:  You already 
possess all the code I developed for you along with all the documentation 
and configurations I have made.  I am holding nothing ransom.  You can 
readily hire another programmer to finish what I've begun without incurring 
any damages on your part.  You certainly possess what you have paid for.  As 
to whatever damages you believe you might incur in replacing me, bear in 
mind that this could have been avoided had you paid me fairly and insulted 
me less frequently.
  I have certainly wanted (and still very much want) to avoid a lawsuit if 
possible but it has been increasingly apparent that our business 
relationship and trust have deteriorated to an irreparable state.  You have 
no basis upon which to sue me - not to mention that I have no assets which 
might make it worth your while.  You are threatening to take me to court 
unless I am willing to keep working unreasonably hard for you on a project 
that was not fully clarified up front and all the while, I would be required 
to continue to endure poor compensation and treatment until the project can 
somehow be completed.  That is untenable to me.  If I had been paid 
appropriately under the terms of the agreement, I would have been able to 
remain full time on the project and progress would not have had to slow down 
in order for me to obtain sufficient income elsewhere.
  I do not think we are capable of working together any longer so I will not 
waste any more time trying to describe an agreement which I think would be 
fair to both of us.  At this juncture, it seems clear that I am not the 
right programmer for you.  You have paid me approximately half of what was 
expected and you have well beyond half of the project completed and in your 
possession.  If you are successful in finding a competent programmer who is 
willing to work with you, I believe there remains approximately 7 or 8 weeks 
of work before your 800Telephone system can possibly see thorough completion 
and deployment.  I wish you well in that regard and would be entirely 
willing to work with whomever you hire to make the transition smooth.

Thank you.

... Well, that just about wraps it up.  Sorry if even the summary is way
too verbose.  I'd sure be glad to be done with all this stuff once &&
for all.  It'd be nice to have been paid more appropriately for my
efforts but it is probably my fault for getting swindled by such a
turd.  TTFN.<br>
