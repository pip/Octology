<center><h4>Pertinant Fish vs. Stuart Emails</h4></center><br>
<p>This document extracts the most descriptive emails from the
salvageable email history between Fish &amp;&amp; Stuart available
at <a href="http://BinQ.org/800tele/lenemail.txt">
http://BinQ.org/800tele/lenemail.txt</a>.  I've commented after each
section.  They should also be in relatively chronological order except
when multiple attachments are included in the same section.  Then they
will be latest to earliest for that section. Basically the deeper the
arrow ( <b>&gt;</b> ) indented nesting level is, the earlier the mail
was.  Hopefully this is a good summary for what happened.</p>

<br>>Subject: Re: Your counter-proposal and misc.
<br>>Date: Mon, 24 Apr 2000 17:09:23 -0700
<br>>
<br>>PIP
<br>>
<br>>My proposal to you, if you will recall was to pay you far more than the
<br>>$500.00 a week I offered you , based purely on your statement that you
<br>>could
<br>>complete it in 8 weeks. Do you recall that? I gratuitously added another
<br>>two
<br>>weeks hedge time. May be $500.00 a week and you looking for other work is
<br>>doable, but I suspect it wouldn't work.
<br>>
<br>>I believe this is the sort of thing I do not want to get involved in. I.E.
<br>>I
<br>>make an offer , you counter-offer, I magnamimously agree, and you
<br>>graciously
<br>>accept my offer, but then want more if things don't turn out as you
<br>>planned.
<br>>I'm afraid I've had all I can take of that sort of thing.
<br>>
<br>>I have no idea how hard you work. I don't care to monitor that. I want to
<br>>look at deliverables on dates.
<br>>
<br>>I will just look for someone else to do the job, if you feel my offer was
<br>>not overly fair.  I've had it with Vijay, and I don't intend to jump back
<br>>in
<br>>the frying pan. I had hoped even if it took longer, you would feel the
<br>>reward of $1000.00 per week would average it out fairly. But, I don't wish
<br>>to get off on the wrong foot where you feel like a socialist abused by a
<br>>capitalist.
<br>>
<br>>If you prefer we can just do things on an hourly basis as before. I'm
<br>>beginning to sour on this whole OM project.
<br>>
<br>>I'm back now. Maybe we can meet and reach some conclusions tonight and
<br>>remain friends.
<br>>
<br>>To answer your other questions: No it has nothing to do with windows. I had
<br>>sent VJ a Linux version of OUTLOOK that works with RH 6.2 and has the
<br>>equivalent of Exchange on our server. Nothing else has to be windows
<br>>compatible now, I don't think. Maybe the x version but, not Microsoft. It
<br>>might be nice, but I don't see it as a necessity.
<br>>
<br>>I have no idea whether the tables will arrive on time or not. His last
<br>>demands have sealed his fate as far as I am concerned. I've turned the
<br>>other
<br>>cheek long enough. Kill all his permissions! I'm tired of working with
<br>>primadonnas.

<br><p>Mr. Fish hired me to setup && administer a webserver.  We initially
<br>agreed that I would be paid $32 / hour for any work I did which
<br>sounded fine to me since I had assumed I would be able to work like
<br>a normal employee for 40+ hours each week.  Mr. Fish had a falling out
<br>with his original programmer (Vijay) before the project had even begun
<br>so he replaced "Vijay" with "Pip" in the text of his contract && had me
<br>take over the development. The project was to enhance an already
<br>supposedly "robust" open source e-commerce system called OpenMerchant.
<br>He didn't want to hire me as an employee and had suggested I be a
<br>contractor (which I had never done before).  I was wiling to try if we
<br>could agree on something fair.  The above email is so telling.  I wanted
<br>to be treated fairly.  Mr. Fish's first offer was for a measly $500 per
<br>week.  I should have looked for work elsewhere at that clear sign that
<br>his aims were to pay as unfairly as possible.  We bickered about the
<br>agreement from the beginning.</p>

<br>>Pip-
<br>>
<br>>Sometime when you get the chance, not necessarily this week, the following
<br>>refinement program should be written for the password module if you have
<br>>not done so already.
<br>>
<br>>Legally, if anyone in the company knows an employee's password, even the
<br>>root administrator, you cannot hold an employee legally responsible based
<br>>on anything they may have done identified by the password they operated
<br>>under.
<br>>
<br>>Thus we should generate a randon PIN at the time they come on board and
<br>>give it to them. There should be an admin page (not graphic designed, just
<br>>plain vanilla) where any employee can change their pin number as long as
<br>>they know the old one. They will be instructed to immediately change that
<br>>pin given to them and change it in the future any time they believe their
<br>>pin may have been compromised.
<br>>
<br>>The pin should be stored encrypted, and shown as asteriskd when they type
<br>>it in (twice for comparison). I don't think we should use the hint thing
<br>>for employees. People are too litigious.
<br>>
<br>>Throughout the system, if someone, anyone,  inserts their pin number
<br>>incorrectly four times in a one hour period, lock the account and print out
<br>>the fact in an exception file which automatically is generated for
<br>>management once every 24 hrs. If suddenlt there are more than x lockouts in
<br>>a 10 minute the period, the system administrator must be notified at once,
<br>>plus the person on duty for the current shift.
<br>>
<br>>Give me a call Sunday, when you are awake.

<br><p>Clearly we had discussed ditching OpenMerchant at this time.  Mr. Fish had
<br>already written version 0.9.6 off && was incapable of comprehending the
<br>abbrev. of 0.9.6 to simply 9.6 for pre-release development.  The 1.0 release
<br>happened with a name change to AllCommerce (from OpenMerchant).  I had tried
<br>for weeks to get 0.7.4 && 0.9.6 to work correctly on the server.  I was
<br>unsuccessful && was getting farther behind as a result so we decided to
<br>discard OpenMerchant right before they released AllCommerce 1.0 (which
<br>probably wasn't any better than 0.9.6 of OM).  Anyway, the above mail is
<br>basically the most relevant of all as it acknowledges the fact that I was
<br>preparing to reimplement the core functionality of OM from scratch since
<br>there was no other way for me to fulfill the contract (I couldn't get OM
<br>to work by itself, much less enhance it for Mr. Fish's purposes).</p>

<br><p>This is an incredible example of Mr. Fish's incapacity to comprehend

<br>>
<br>>I don't know. It still says it is 7.6. However it has many better features
<br>>for creating product listings. Still, except for a nice pull down menu
<br>>creation screen, it seems a bit sophmoric. Maybe a demo for 1.0 All
<br>>Commerce would be better.
<br>>
<br>>I really feel the constraints of their system would make the product we
<br>>have started a weak compromise. With a decent input page generator, and
<br>>also output page generator we could easily do what they do.
<br>>
<br>>If some of their code is cleaner, you can always cut and paste for some
<br>>things.
<br>>
<br>>If you think it's great, and will do what we want, you are free to make a
<br>>reasoned argument for it. I frankly don't see it. We have a better bedrock
<br>>base already.

<br><p>This was another ridiculous situation.  Early on, Mr. Fish asked if I'd

<br>a T1 line."  Weeks later, he shows me his new office && tells me I can
<br>work there && move the server in from his home.  I told him I would when
<br>he bought a T1 line for the office.  Until then, the cable modems the
<br>server && I were connected to were better than the dial-up phone modems
<br>he intended to utilize until he could weasel a deal for some cheap DSL.
<br>He got all upset as if I had chose the office && had promised that I
<br>would work from it && now happily wasted his money by staying at home.
<br>The truth is that he found && rented the office on his own.  I didn't
<br>even see it until he had already excitedly moved his own stuff in.  I
<br>didn't mislead him.  I probably would have worked nights there if he
<br>would have bought a T1 line but he couldn't justify that expenditure so
<br>I couldn't justify leaving my bedroom && cable modem.  It was simple to
<br>me but he wanted to argue about it && got all venomous.  I told him he

<br>>As the agreement points out, you are the programmer. As you were always
<br>>well aware that Perl is not compileable and have recently carefully pointed
<br>>that out to me, I must assume you as an expert in Perl and CGI knew that
<br>>all along, and therefore where the word "compileable" is utilized in our
<br>>agreement, it does not apply to Perl or CGI.
<br>>
<br>>Paragraph 5 is also germain with respect to turning over documentation.
<br>>
<br>>It might also be helpful for you to re-read Exhibit "C". While I have tried
<br>>to be lenient, as you were far behind schedule, your continued insistance
<br>>that you wish to be considered strictly a contractor is a fair request, and
<br>>both sides should abide by that.
<br>>
<br>>By the end of next week, we shall expect Exhibit "C" to have been fully
<br>>complied with.
<br>>
<br>>If you have any problem with any of the above, please let me know at once.

<br>not a lawyer && cannot afford to hire one.  I don't have savings.  I was
<br>suckered into doing contract work (for the first time) for Fish.  I got
<br>in way over my head && worked as hard as I could to get out but he made

<br><p>More threats... The "building your own website" he refers to is none
<br>other than this server http://BinQ.org which hasn't changed since I set
<br>it up back then.  You can load the homepage && view the source in your

<br>was already working on his stuff nearly 80 hours each week) was an
<br>unacceptable "side track".  He wanted a slave.</p>

<br><p>Fish is an asshole!  I was leaving to be with my brother as he underwent

<br>is about the time when I began to hate this worthless excuse for a man
<br>who calls himself Fish && who treats everyone he encounters poorly
<br>because his own intelligence has been falsely self inflated for the
<br>greater part of a century.  Time && a bit of maturity have enabled me to
<br>harbor less resentment over the whole ordeal... but reliving the old
<br>feelings chronicled in all this email rekindles my anger towards this
<br>wicked man.  I'm tired of thinking about his stupidity.  I'm frustrated
<br>that he was able to treat me so poorly && waste months of my life &&
<br>keep me in this arbitration for almost a year now.  He would be
<br>absolutely nothing in this world if he didn't have money because he
<br>obviously has never learned how to deal with people nicely.  He's so
<br>afraid of being a worthless bitter old man that he is always trying to
<br>prove his compentence && usefulness in things that he knows very little
<br>about.  Fish is just a big old jirk who got lucky with Silly String.
<br>Maybe he'll sue me for using his brand without permission now.  Maybe his

<br>>
<br>>PIP
<br>>
<br>>I like you. I want to help you, but you are in my opinion making it
<br>>difficult to do so. Today was just another typical day in another typical
<br>>week. We got very little accomplished since last Sunday. A lot of
<br>>pointless
<br>>arguing, a lot of excuses for not getting things done, but not much
<br>>cooperation and coding.
<br>>
<br>>I had up until now attributed your attitude to honorable motives. I am now
<br>>reconsidering even that last vestige of hope in your willingness to fulfill
<br>>your commitments to me without a huge ration of mental gymnastics. I am not
<br>>up to playing your mental video games. My commitment to you was based on
<br>>your honest efforts,
<br>>
<br>>Today you didn't bother calling till 3:20 P.M. I had given up on hearing
<br>>from you so left my cellular in the house while I worked in the garage. 40
<br>>minutes later I noticed a message. By the way you never called again, as I
<br>>have caller ID on  my cellular. I called  at 4:00PM and got an answering
<br>>machine that said Hello----Hello, I left a message. At 4:20 I called again-
<br>>still the same message and no answer. At 4:45 still the same message and no
<br>>answer.
<br>>
<br>>Out of defference to your religious beliefs (which in my opinion do not
<br>>square with your actions), I didn't call again. :Pious is as Pious does. So
<br>>at 6:20PM you sent me another excuse message via e-mail why you have
<br>>accomplished little if anything, along with a request to be able to
<br>>reanalyse our agreement and send you $500.00. Apparently from your request,
<br>>it's too much for you at this late stage to know what you agreed to do from
<br>>the written agreements in your possession.
<br>>
<br>>I see no justification to pay you another $500.00 while you are playing
<br>>mind
<br>>games and delivering nothing. If you care to update the web page code by
<br>>throwing away (deleting code, and making a few adjustments as I have
<br>>suggested,)  I will do my part and advance you another $500.00. I will also
<br>>pay next months rent at the end of July, as I have previously told you I
<br>>would not hang you out to dry.
<br>>
<br>>But, Pip, if you intend to continue with your arguing, excuses for not
<br>>getting code and documentation done, and in general acting like I am the
<br>>Social Security system, do not count on me after that.
<br>>
<br>>It's quite elementary and simple. You have trashed our agreement. Cost me a
<br>>great deal of money by so doing, and I can no longer support your selfish
<br>>ways. I'd rather play solitaire in my empty office until I find a solid
<br>>citizen to work with.
<br>>
<br>>When you can set working hours for yourself , you being your own boss, and
<br>>give priorities to work over play, as evidence by working code, you can
<br>>expect checks from me. In the absence thereof, putting up a web page, and
<br>>making some small improvements to your code, or spending an hour
<br>>begrudgingly to install a disk drive to save you time from a potential
<br>>crash, or rapidly downloading a new version of SQl are not a weeks
<br>>contribution. As was true with a lady I tried to help, there comes a time
<br>>when , having lived up to MY agreements, I must wait for the other party to
<br>>catch up.
<br>>
<br>>In short you have played me for Joe Stupid as long as I care to be played.
<br>>It's simple. No code per the agreement, no money. Capitalism has made this
<br>>country great. If one cares to work, they can achieve wonders. Look around
<br>>you. If one chooses to achieve the good lifestyle, they can become a
<br>>Newport
<br>>Beach guru. They can also choose to be a beach bum. I would not be of help
<br>>to you if I further encouraged the latter lifestyle.
<br>>
<br>>You have in me a person who has the capability and had the desire to set
<br>>you
<br>>up financially, so you could throw away your career, if you so chose, on
<br>>your own. You have cut that process off in its prime.  Maybe that was the
<br>>right decision for you.
<br>>
<br>>If you re-read the above, it boils down to if you care to deliver the goods
<br>>you will be paid, (with the exception of your August rent.) If you don't,
<br>>you will have to find another source of income (but without infringing our
<br>>agreement re: confidentiality or liability for non-completion).
<br>>
<br>>BTW-You have chosen e-mail as a way to avoid me knowing when you are
<br>>working
<br>>and at home, and when you are not. It is not fooling anyone, The proof is
<br>>always in what you are accomplishing, and that for a period of 10 weeks is
<br>>not commensurate with your coding abilities and the time elapsed.
<br>>
<br>>I'd be happy to meet with you Saturday night or later Sunday afternoon. I
<br>>have previous engagements earlier on Sunday. That way you can have another
<br>>excuse to kill the better part of Sunday.

<br>>Subject: A clean solution to the HTML coder problem
<br>>Date: Sat, 8 Jul 2000 07:48:43 -0700
<br>>
<br>>PIP:
<br>>
<br>>Please do not figure out all the reasons you won't or can't or how huge a
<br>>job it is to implement the rather simple , clean, LOGICAL, solution I
<br>>suggest to clean up the coder interface for the average HTML programmer.
<br>>
<br>>It leaves your existing code TOTALLY in tact, and uses your favorite table
<br>>method which is HTML compatible.
<br>>
<br>>It would be refreshing, although probably asking far too much, for you to
<br>>view this suggestion which hit me this AM at 5:00, with a positive
<br>>attitude, as opposed to it wasn't invented here. It's sent in Word for
<br>>windows , an earlier version. If you have Word, it should work. Notice
<br>>among other things, no curley cues, braces or periods.
<br>>
<br>>Len
<br></code>
<br><p>He wanted me to fundamentally alter the entire syntax && parsing rules
<br>which were the assumptions all of my modules were built upon.  I didn't
<br>isolate them in a header file because I never imagined I would be second
<br>guessed or that my decisions would need to be overridden.  There wasn't
<br>any good reason for the rewrite.  I designed && implemented the necessary
<br>functionality.  I was unwilling to rewrite it for an arbitrary &&
<br>unrealistic reason.</p>

<br>>Pip
<br>>
<br>>I'm too busy to take care of your extraneous desires. I have gone far more
<br>>than the extra mile for you, and have been abused for my efforts. Life is a
<br>>two way street. People do get tired of their continual efforts to be
<br>>helpful
<br>>responded to by more neglect. You can run your consulting business as you
<br>>please, and we can react as we appropriately please.
<br>>
<br>>If you have any specific questions about your responsibilities under the
<br>>contract, and can't take any of your valuable time away from your important
<br>>pool playing and games playing, I'll try to find the time to answer your
<br>>questions, as I have certainly read it carefully, as did you being an
<br>>adult,
<br>>a business man running his own consulting service, and capable of demanding
<br>>a certain price for his work. Try asking a specific question. Otherwise I
<br>>cannot help you.
<br>>
<br>>While I hate to bring it up, we are now facing serious monetary damages
<br>>because of your failure to deliver. They get more signifiicant each day.
<br>>It
<br>>will be difficult for me to ask my associates to turn the other cheek. If
<br>>it's a lawsuit you are looking for, I suggest you will be quite succesful
<br>>in
<br>>that desire, based on your actions. I hope at your early career stage you
<br>>will not make that mistake, and perhaps blemish your public record history.
<br>>
<br>>Please don't count on any extra busy work by me while you are in and have
<br>>been for weeks in serious default of our agreement.
<br>>
<br>>You as a consultant have also failed to repond to at least two other
<br>>e-mails
<br>>I sent you over the wekend, as well as ignored invitations to meet Saturday
<br>>Eve. or Sunday afternoon.

<br>>
<br>>Pip:
<br>>
<br>>A little re-cap of ysterdays late afternoon meeting.
<br>>
<br>>I think I have been very understanding of your stealth move to take a full
<br>>time position.
<br>>
<br>>I cannot help but believe and I think you agree, it is your obligation to
<br>>complete your agreement in a reasonable time frame, (as you are already
<br>>several weeks past due the "complete date" with significant programming
<br>>left).
<br>>
<br>>I am willing to entetain a new reasonable schedule, as I have always been.
<br>>I just was not willing to re-write the agreement. You chose not to respond
<br>>to that suggestion. I'd be happy to send you a copy of the e-mail around
<br>>the time of my trip to Las Vegas, but I am sure you are familiar with it.
<br>>After the first four weeks of the agreement, you were actually paid by work
<br>>performed, not the schedule.
<br>>
<br>>I also invited you to explain why OS was a desirable base for you to build
<br>>upon per the agreement, but again no reply. You chose to build it basically
<br>>on MySql and Red Hat as opposed to OS. You had already done the major part
<br>>of that change i.e. tables and permissions, when you slipped into that
<br>>mode. You were always, and still are, given the choice of utilizing ideas
<br>>and concepts from OS. So far you have ignored doing that. We have agreed
<br>>not to take actual code from OS.
<br>>
<br>>If it were not for my help (and E-mails) you would probably still be
<br>>struggling with OS Cookies.
<br>>
<br>>Per our conversation with Matt and afterwards, I am willing to allow you to
<br>>finish the agreement, and pay you the balance due under our agreement. I
<br>>expect 35-40 hours week effort as opposed to 60 or 80 for which you
<br>>apparently wish a premium. There are some who might take the position,
<br>>being behind seriously, you owe us that, but I guess in the ethics of
<br>>today, that is un-realistic.
<br>>
<br>>Matt and I look forward to a realistic schedule based on the fact that the
<br>>infrastructure is mostly done, and the schedule to be in accord with the
<br>>applications time frames in the agreement. Payment to be made on
<br>>deliverables, with daily time accounting, but only two or three times each
<br>>week detailing work done. It would be refreshing to have you work and react
<br>>as a solid somewhat mature business partner, as opposed to an oppresed
<br>>indentured servant. You might be pleased with the ending outcome.

<br>July 30, 0 -> Len && Matt
<br>
<br>  What are you talking about?  What commitment have I not lived up to?  That
<br>I let 28 hours go by between our meeting last Wednesday and the time I sent
<br>you an email?  That I told you that I couldn't werk because you unplugged
<br>the server?  That I told you that I intended to have something prepared for
<br>our new agreement next Wednesday night (and Wed. is not here yet)?
<br>  I'm not sure what I'm always deficient in that you think I need to make
<br>excuses to you but I'm really tired of all this stupidity.  If I have to
<br>deal with this crap much more (especially with the regularity which you're
<br>demanding), I'm going to have to quit doing anything for you and let you
<br>turn it over to whoever you think will accomplish your goals for you.  Maybe
<br>your goals now include garnishing my wages in the upcoming years.  If that's
<br>more important to you than finishing this software, you'll at least get a
<br>shot in court if you keep acting as you have been.
<br>  I don't like dealing with you.  I don't have to anymore.  You should want
<br>me to continue dealing with you but you don't seem to want me to.  I thought
<br>I made it clear last week that I'd prefer we each went our separate ways.
<br>I'm tired of werking for you.  You're tired of my "poor work ethic" and all
<br>the other innumerable deficiencies you've attributed to me over the past
<br>months.  You've payed me poorly.  Apparently it's "blackmail" or something
<br>worse for me to ask to be payed any better going forward.
<br>  Presently, you want me to finish this project.  You're not comprehending
<br>that I don't want or need to deal with your insanity anymore.  You have one
<br>more chance to get off my back with all the antagonistic emails before I
<br>refuse to ever "lift a finger" for you again.  You can sue and whatever will
<br>happen will happen but if your goal is to get this software written, you are
<br>sabotaging yourself.
<br>  I'm not really afraid of litigation from you.  At this point, I'd be
<br>dismayed by the waste of time it would entail for me but (hypothetically) I
<br>might even be glad to pay you for you to just leave me alone.  I sincerely
<br>doubt that I would lose any money though after the situation was closely
<br>examined considering how favorable California laws are toward contractors.
<br>  Now (assuming you're going to be less hostile as an outgrowth of your new
<br>understanding as to how we are to accomplish anything together), I can send
<br>you an email every single day (which contains only the number of hours I've
<br>werked for you) if this is what you need but I will not read email from you
<br>every day.  We can schedule a meeting once a week.
<br>  I'm am getting well established in my new office and currently have the
<br>ability to accomplish a lot of werk for both them and you.  Is it worth it
<br>for me to do so?  Once you answer that question from my perspective (which I
<br>doubt you're capable of doing), you'll have a grasp on how to handle this.
<br>Until now, you've really blown it.
<br>  I think it is fair that you unplug the server whenever you feel like it.
<br>Your paranoia and general fear of things you don't understand (like this
<br>"young generation") govern your actions and I've grown to accept that a
<br>server located close to you is not a stable place to develop software.  I
<br>hope Nataly can accept the same volatility if/when she encounters it.  When
<br>the server is not accessible, I will not be able to test any code I have
<br>written.  Please keep that in mind whenever you feel compelled to pull the
<br>plug and don't pretend that I have lame excuses when I code a lot for you
<br>and can't even run it only because of you.
<br>  The more I read emails from you the more I think you are the one incapable
<br>of communicating effectively.  I have been quite clear about many different
<br>issues in the past and you somehow bumble over the text and only ingest what
<br>you're hoping for but you entirely omit or misunderstand the key elements.
<br>The exchange below is characteristic... (in the email sent early Friday
<br>morning) I state clearly that I'm werking on a new agreement which should be
<br>ready by "Wednesday" and if it's not done by then, I'll explain why by then.
<br>  Maybe this is terribly confusing.  Maybe you thought I meant some
<br>Wednesday in 1963.  Maybe the "Wednesday" when viewed on your screen read
<br>like "yesterday" or "Friday".  I'm not sure what happened but I am sure that
<br>I don't think I'm the incapable communicator in our relationship (or what's
<br>left of it) despite how adamantly you affirm that I am.
<br>  It seems we're playing hardball now.  I like the sport.  I used to be a
<br>pretty decent 2nd baseman.  It's your turn at the plate.  Sa-wing batta.
<br>  TTFN.

<br>>Date: Tue, 1 Aug 2000 10:05:42 -0700
<br>>
<br>>Pip:
<br>>
<br>>Based on your e-mail of 7/30, your actions over the past 13 weeks, and your
<br>>general attitude that your word, written or oral is only good as long as it
<br>>suits you, I can no longer rely on you or your iffy software developed for
<br>>us.
<br>>
<br>>We, nor anyone else can build a business on quicksand. Businesses are made
<br>>on agreements, by people who not only wish to negotiate the highest
<br>>possible price and agree on a fixed price contract to get it, but by people
<br>>who  maintain their written and and/or oral agreements, as opposed to
<br>>spending more time writing excuses and purported justifications than
<br>>software.
<br>>
<br>>Based on your e-mail you wish to unilaterally change our agreement, and
<br>>increase the price because you have not been able to come close to
<br>>completeing your agreement with or without OS as promised. The problem with
<br>>that is : You did not live up to your last agreement, why would we trust
<br>>you on any new one?. This particularly in view of your classic 7/30 e-mail,
<br>>which I feel certain the arbitrator or court will find inciteful.
<br>>
<br>>If your new "Wednesday" agreement agrees to finish the contract with 35 to
<br>>40 hours a week, and hypothetically the extra payoff would come as a bonus
<br>>at the completion feel free to submit it. If it is a new agreement based on
<br>>your "Napster" view of law, it may not be worth the time to submit it.
<br>>
<br>>You say I am "up to bat." I think you have misjudged my options. After
<br>>considerable thought, I have decided to unplug the server, put the software
<br>>in a vault, and start all over, holding you responsible for the costs to
<br>>crash through a new program and damages for this disasterous 13 week
<br>>default.  I am sure you noted when you negotiated the agreement that "Time
<br>>was of the essence". It was. You are over 21, and smart enough to make over
<br>>$50,000 a year, and negotiate the agreement  for a higher price as a
<br>>trade-off for a fixed price. You are old enough, and liquid enough to honor
<br>>your written agreements.
<br>>
<br>>Matt is no longer interested in working something out with what he sees as
<br>>a gun pointed to our heads by yes; a blackmailer. You need not copy him
<br>>again, as I believe he does not feel you are capable of an honorable
<br>>resolution within our agreement. You had the chance, and you chose to
<br>>ignore it. Yes 30 hours when the next report was due  in 12, and with your
<br>>previous transgressions,  is under the circumstances, major.
<br>>
<br>>You told Matt and I your employer knows of your work for us. That if true,
<br>>may constitute interference with a contractual relationship. We also feel
<br>>it in the interest of potential employers to relate our experience with Pip
<br>>Stuart, to Dice and Guru. Feel free to tell them and send them our
<br>>agreement, as well as your experiences with me.

<br>>I will save my detailed reply for the arbitrator.
<br>>
<br>>From the time you were instrumental in getting rid of VJ, you have ignored
<br>>our agreement and did it your way.
<br>>
<br>>Despite my efforts to pay you despite your half hearted work ethic, and
<br>>abuse of me, you continued to tell me off at every opportunity.
<br>>
<br>>Had you not tricked me into hiring you stating Open Merchant was a viable
<br>>platform for the agreement, you would have been paid according to the
<br>>deliverables. You were given all the details of the work you were to
<br>>perform , in writing prior to your signing the agreement. I have no
<br>>reasonable documentation, no flow charts, no configuration listings or
<br>>narratives.
<br>>
<br>>In business we must rely on contracts. Unfortunately, I relied upon your
<br>>word. You clearly feel contracts are for others.

<br>>In your 7/30 letter you still insisted upon additional remuneration.
<br>>
<br>>In your reply you state.
<br>>
<br>>"I was still willing to complete the project if
<br>>we could agree upon a more relaxed schedule since you made it clear that I
<br>>would not be paid any more reasonably for the remainder of development."
<br>>
<br>>That seems to be a change in your position. My position was if there was no
<br>>additional compensation demanded (you seem to agree to that) and if 35-40
<br>>hours of effort per week was expended on finishing, I was willing to
<br>>proceed. I still would be if you could bring yourself to stop emanating
<br>>venom, and trying to subvert any associates of mine you meet such as "What
<br>>kind of a mess have we gotten ourselves into?" There is no way I could
<br>>trust you to work with a new programmer, hence requiring a fresh start.
<br>>
<br>>In view of the fact that you admittedly spent only a total of 3 hours in
<br>>the past 9 days  and 0 essentially for the latest week,  This
<br>>"blackmailing" made it impossible to go forward.
<br>>
<br>>I am preparing the arbitration demand which will be filed as soon as it is
<br>>completed. It is obvious from all your correspondence that you confuse a
<br>>contractual business relationship with being an employee. We had no
<br>>obligation to pay you anything above and beyond our agreement, nor
<br>>incidentally did you make any such demand until after you took a job.
<br>>
<br>>You chose to abandon Open Merchant and I agreed, because you felt it would
<br>>be faster. I have no obligation to change anything due your failure to
<br>>properly analyse OM prior to taking on the contract despite my repeated
<br>>plea that you do so.
<br>>
<br>>I am writing this because I wish to clarify, that you have changed your
<br>>position since your highly insulting and improper letter of July 30.

<br>Aug. 2, 0 -> Len && Matt
<br>
<br>Hello Len,
<br>  I just wanted to make it very clear that I deeply regret the situation we
<br>have now found ourselves in.  And it is important to point out that the
<br>waning of my progress on your 800Telephone system was the direct result of
<br>failure to comply with the agreed financial arrangements between us.  I was
<br>paid an amount which was significantly less than half of the amount
<br>described in our original agreement.  In addition, there are many factors
<br>that were not contemplated under the original agreement.  When we decided
<br>not to utilize OpenSales, for instance, there was an entire set of
<br>functionality which I needed to construct from scratch.  This had not been
<br>detailed or even foreseen in the contract.  I have consistently tried to be
<br>reasonable and help the project through to finalization and even after you
<br>had threatened legal action, I was still willing to complete the project if
<br>we could agree upon a more relaxed schedule since you made it clear that I
<br>would not be paid any more reasonably for the remainder of development.
<br>  In an effort to show good faith and to help you attain your goals, I had
<br>persisted on the project, even though it was consuming a lot of my time and
<br>despite the fact that my living expenses were only narrowly covered by the
<br>income I was deriving from my work for you.  Ultimately, however, I was
<br>forced to seek new employment since the project's scope was expanding and
<br>consuming more hours but the commensurate payments were not forthcoming.  I
<br>had no other way to support myself.
<br>  Another unfortunate aspect of all this is that when I started employment
<br>with you, I was enthusiastic about the opportunity to share your vision and
<br>make it come to life.  However, throughout my work with you, the reality is
<br>that I have felt consistently abused by you.  You have antagonized and
<br>insulted me often.  You have implied or explicitly stated that you believe I
<br>am attempting to cheat you.  Please be clear on this point:  You already
<br>possess all the code I developed for you along with all the documentation
<br>and configurations I have made.  I am holding nothing ransom.  You can
<br>readily hire another programmer to finish what I've begun without incurring
<br>any damages on your part.  You certainly possess what you have paid for.  As
<br>to whatever damages you believe you might incur in replacing me, bear in
<br>mind that this could have been avoided had you paid me fairly and insulted
<br>me less frequently.
<br>  I have certainly wanted (and still very much want) to avoid a lawsuit if
<br>possible but it has been increasingly apparent that our business
<br>relationship and trust have deteriorated to an irreparable state.  You have
<br>no basis upon which to sue me - not to mention that I have no assets which
<br>might make it worth your while.  You are threatening to take me to court
<br>unless I am willing to keep working unreasonably hard for you on a project
<br>that was not fully clarified up front and all the while, I would be required
<br>to continue to endure poor compensation and treatment until the project can
<br>somehow be completed.  That is untenable to me.  If I had been paid
<br>appropriately under the terms of the agreement, I would have been able to
<br>remain full time on the project and progress would not have had to slow down
<br>in order for me to obtain sufficient income elsewhere.
<br>  I do not think we are capable of working together any longer so I will not
<br>waste any more time trying to describe an agreement which I think would be
<br>fair to both of us.  At this juncture, it seems clear that I am not the
<br>right programmer for you.  You have paid me approximately half of what was
<br>expected and you have well beyond half of the project completed and in your
<br>possession.  If you are successful in finding a competent programmer who is
<br>willing to work with you, I believe there remains approximately 7 or 8 weeks
<br>of work before your 800Telephone system can possibly see thorough completion
<br>and deployment.  I wish you well in that regard and would be entirely
<br>willing to work with whomever you hire to make the transition smooth.
<br>
<br>Thank you.

... Well, that just about wraps it up.  Sorry if even the summary is way
too verbose.  I'd sure be glad to be done with all this stuff once &&
for all.  It'd be nice to have been paid more appropriately for my
efforts but it is probably my fault for getting swindled by such a
turd.  TTFN.<br>
