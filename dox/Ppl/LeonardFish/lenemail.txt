*NOTE*  For the majority of the time I worked for Mr. Fish, I relied
on Microsoft Hotmail for email services.  I have saved every email I
was able to once I realized that they would be important.  Most of my
outgoing emails were not saved because the default option was to only
save sent mail if a checkbox was clicked which I usually didn't think
to do.  Hotmail has a 2MB limit on mailbox size && I have had 1MB of
mine occupied by email between Mr. Fish && myself since this all
happened.  He used to regularly send me enormous attachments which
I've had to delete along with the messages they were attached to due
to the above space limitations.  I have salvaged every email that I
was able to.
  When it became apparent that I would need to print them out, I had
to forward them all to another email account so that I could download
them in a text format.  Whenever I had to resend an email I originally
sent, I included a -> (To?) line whenever it wasn't being sent solely
to Mr. Fish.  I also included the date originally sent when possible.
I wish I could just provide access to my email account since all this
hard copying obscures the natural progression of correspondence and
is therefore somewhat difficult to follow.  The read messages are all
bunched together && the sent messages follow so chronological order
may be difficult to determine just by the flow of responses.
  At least this document contains a time-stamped record of issues,
arguments, && emotions.  Hopefully I can just refer to particularly
relevant sections as pointed evidence of Mr. Fish's constant
irrational accusations, arguments, unreasonable new requirements, etc.
  So in summary, I'm sorry that this record is not more complete but
it's the best I could do under the circumstances and I will work with
it to the best of my ability.  Hopefully it contains plenty to clearly
demonstrate that I was never malicious with Mr. Fish && worked as
diligently as I could until I needed to acquire additional income to
afford my living expenses.

-Philip Stuart
p.s. Since I write code predominantly in a programming language called
"Perl", I often intentionally misspell werds into or out of Perl-like
spellings to reflect how technical or how much I liked doing something.
Thus, if I enjoyed doing some coding, I usually called it "werk".
Similarly, if I describe a person who not be technical or fun to deal
with (in my opinion), then I might refer to them as a "jirk".  This is
just a playful mechanism I have made up to subtly categorize several
common things that I deal with regularly (eg. the werld, lerning,
serfing, etc.).  I also occassionally misspell words that rhyme with
"ink" to be "inq" since I registered a domain for my server that is
an acronym pronounced "BinK" but spelled "BinQ".  Common examples of
this are "thinq" && "linq".

>Thus sofq103 would be manufacturer or service etc., sof and the discrete

>We can also assign a meaning to the fourth character for quick visual and

>Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store
>Sleepycat Software offers Berkeley DB in configurations targeted at 
>different applications. The Transactional Data Store product is our 
>high-end database offering. Richer in features than both Berkeley DB Data 
>Store and Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store, Berkeley DB Transactional Data 
>Store provides the power and flexibility of high-end database management in 
>a compact, easy-to-use package.
>
>Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store is intended for programmers writing 
>applications that need a fast, scalable transactional data store with 
>support for disaster recovery. It permits multiple users to read and write 
>data in the database at the same time, and uses a fine-grained locking 
>scheme to maximize concurrency and minimize contention for data. It 
>includes a logging service that permits multiple changes to the database to 
>be grouped into transactions, and to be committed or rolled back 
>atomically. The log and data files can reside on separate disks, so that 
>databases can survive catastrophic loss of either disk. Berkeley DB 
>Transactional Data Store's features, performance, and reliability are 
>unmatched in the embedded database market.
>
>Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store uses the same on-disk storage 
>structures, or access methods, as our other database products. It provides 
>an easy-to-use C API for storing, searching for, and updating records. 
>Other APIs are available separately.
>
>Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store provides enterprise-class data 
>management services to programmers without the complexity, size, and 
>management headaches of the relational products available from other 
>vendors.
>
>Features
>Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store offers the following features:
>
>   a.. Full source code availability.
>   b.. Small footprint (as small as 150Kbytes).
>   c.. Easy-to-use C API.
>   d.. Uses native O/S file system for storage.
>   e.. Thread-safe implementation.
>   f.. Database dump and load utilities.
>   g.. Support for keys and values of arbitrary data types, including 
>programming language data structures.
>   h.. Keyed and sequential traversal for retrieval, insertion, 
>modification and deletion.
>   i.. Retrieval into user-specified or allocated memory.
>   j.. Partial-record data storage and retrieval.
>   k.. Cursors.
>   l.. Joins.
>   m.. Memory-mapped read-only databases.
>   n.. Architecture independent databases.
>   o.. Individual databases up to 248 bytes.
>   p.. Key and data values of up to 232 bytes.
>   q.. Single- or multi-user read-write database access.
>   r.. Fine-grained, high-concurrency locking strategy permits readers and 
>writers to share access to a single database, and minimizes contention for 
>data.
>   s.. Before and after-image logging.
>   t.. Database recovery after application or system failure, including 
>catastrophic failures.
>   u.. Online ("hot") database backups.
>   v.. General-purpose lock, log, transaction and shared memory buffer pool 
>with standalone interfaces.
>Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store is Sleepycat's enterprise-class 
>embedded multi-user database engine. It provides the reliability, 
>protection, and performance of much more expensive products in an 
>easy-to-use package targeted precisely at professional software developers.
>
>Scalability
>Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store maintains caches and other shared data 
>in shared memory. As a result, threads of control in the same process, or 
>in other processes, can share data pages read from disk. Data read by one 
>process is available to others. This improves performance for virtually all 
>database applications.
>
>All of the Berkeley DB products have been carefully designed to support 
>large databases and high concurrency. Berkeley DB can address up to 256 
>terabytes of data in a single database. Sleepycat Software customers have 
>single databases that are hundreds of gigabytes in size in daily use. 
>Berkeley DB is able to support thousands of threads working on a single 
>database at a time.
>
>Growth Path
>Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store is our high-end data repository. 
>Applications with less stringent demands can use Berkeley DB Data Store or 
>Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store. As the demands on those applications 
>increase, they can step up to Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store easily. 
>All three products use the same underlying data file formats, and the APIs 
>that they support are compatible up the product line. 2 2

>BerkeleyDB Version 0.11 4th Jun 2000 Copyright (c) 1997-2000 Paul Marquess. 
>All rights reserved. This program is free software; you can redistribute it 
>and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl itself. DESCRIPTION 
>----------- BerkeleyDB is a module which allows Perl programs to make use 
>of the facilities provided by Berkeley DB version 2 or 3. (Note: if you 
>want to use version 1 of Berkeley DB with Perl you need the DB_File 
>module). Berkeley DB is a C library which provides a consistent interface 
>to a number of database formats. BerkeleyDB provides an interface to all 
>four of the database types (hash, btree, queue and recno) currently 
>supported by Berkeley DB. For further details see the documentation in the 
>file BerkeleyDB.pod. PREREQUISITES ------------- Before you can build 
>BerkeleyDB you need to have the following installed on your system: * Perl 
>5.004_04 or greater. * Berkeley DB Version 2.6.4 or greater The official 
>web site for Berkeley DB is http://www.sleepycat.com The latest version of 
>Berkeley DB is always available there. It is recommended that you use the 
>most recent version available at the Sleepycat site. The one exception to 
>this advice is where you want to use BerkeleyDB to access database files 
>created by a third-party application, like Sendmail. In these cases you 
>must build BerkeleyDB with a compatible version of Berkeley DB. BUILDING 
>THE MODULE ------------------- Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, 
>building the module should be relatively straightforward. Step 1 : If you 
>are running either Solaris 2.5 or HP-UX 10 read either the Solaris Notes or 
>HP-UX Notes sections below. If you are running Linux please read the Linux 
>Notes section before proceeding. Step 2 : Edit the file config.in to suit 
>you local installation. Instructions are given in the file. Step 3 : Build 
>and test the module using using this sequence of commands: perl Makefile.PL 
>make make test INSTALLATION ------------ make install TROUBLESHOOTING 
>=============== Here are some of the problems that people encounter when 
>building BerkeleyDB. Missing db.h or libdb.a ----------------------- If you 
>get an error like this: cc -c -I./libraries/ -Dbool=char -DHAS_BOOL

>(e.g. RedHat 6) ship with a C library that has a version of Berkeley DB 
>linked into it. This makes it very difficult to build DB_File with anything 
>other than the version of Berkeley DB that shipped with your Linux release. 
>If you do try to use a different version of Berkeley DB you will probably 
>get the error described in the "Incompatible versions of db.h and libdb" 
>section of this file. As yet I haven't found a satisfactory way around this 
>problem. If you do know a workaround to this problem which doesn't involve 
>replacing the built in version of Berkeley DB I would like to hear from 
>you. Solaris Notes ------------- If you are running Solaris 2.5, and you 
>get this error when you run the BerkeleyDB test harness: libc internal 
>error: _rmutex_unlock: rmutex not held. you probably need to install a Sun 
>patch. It has been reported that Sun patch 103187-25 (or later revisions) 
>fixes this problem. To find out if you have the patch installed, the 
>command "showrev -p" will display the patches that are currently installed 
>on your system. HP-UX Notes ----------- Some people running HP-UX 10 have 
>reported getting an error like this when building this module with the 
>native HP-UX compiler. ld: (Warning) At least one PA 2.0 object file 
>(BerkeleyDB.o) was detected. The linked output may not run on a PA 1.x 
>system. ld: Invalid loader fixup for symbol "$000000A5". If this is the 
>case for you, Berkeley DB needs to be recompiled with the +z or +Z option 
>and the resulting library placed in a .sl file. The following steps should 
>do the trick: 1: Configure the Berkeley DB distribution with the +z or +Z C 
>compiler flag: env "CFLAGS=+z" ../dist/configure ... 2: Edit the Berkeley 
>DB Makefile and change: "libdb= libdb.a" to "libdb= libdb.sl". 3: Build and 
>install the Berkeley DB distribution as usual. FEEDBACK -------- How to 
>report a problem with BerkeleyDB. To help me help you, I need of the 
>following information: 1. The version of Perl and the operating system name 
>and version you are running. The complete output from running "perl -V" 
>will tell me all I need to know. If your perl does not understand the "-V" 
>option is is too old. BerkeleyDB needs Perl version 5.004_04 or better. 2. 
>The version of BerkeleyDB you have. If you have successfully installed 
>BerkeleyDB, this one-liner will tell you: perl -MBerkeleyDB -e 'print 
>"BerkeleyDB ver $BerkeleyDB::VERSION\n"' If you haven't installed 
>BerkeleyDB then search BerkeleyDB.pm for a line like this: $VERSION = 
>"1.20" ; 3. The version of Berkeley DB you have installed. If you have 
>successfully installed BerkeleyDB, this one-liner will tell you: perl 
>-MBerkeleyDB -e 'print BerkeleyDB::DB_VERSION_STRING."\n"' If you haven't 
>installed BerkeleyDB then search db.h for a line like this: #define 
>DB_VERSION_STRING 4. If you are having problems building BerkeleyDB, send 
>me a complete log of what happened. 5. Now the difficult one. If you think 
>you have found a bug in BerkeleyDB and you want me to fix it, you will 
>*greatly* enhance the chances of me being able to track it down by sending 
>me a small self-contained Perl script that illustrates the problem you are 
>encountering. Include a summary of what you think the problem is and a log 
>of what happens when you run the script, in case I can't reproduce your 
>problem on my system. If possible, don't have the script dependent on an 
>existing 20Meg database. If the script you send me can create the database 
>itself then that is preferred. I realise that in some cases this is easier 
>said than done, so if you can only reproduce the problem in your existing 
>script, then you can post me that if you want. Just don't expect me to find

>The system is primarily composed of 3 programs:
>
>index.cgi - The default script which validates passwords and handles
>

>
>dp.cgi - This script is a slimmed version of index.cgi which
>
>specializes in DynamicPages only. It lets index.cgi
>
>validate the login and takes the handoff from there.
>
>pw.pl - This is utility employed by the above scripts to
>
>handle an abstracted method for generating and
>
>processing unique session identification codes.
>
>Almost everything in the system (from users to protected pages to data
>
>fields to images) has 3 different permissions associated with it. They
>
>are: Read, Insert, and Delete. The system validation checks each
>
>permission level according to the requested operation. Lower permission 
>numbers apply to users with higher security levels. E.G. a user with 
>permissions Read=0, Insert=0, & Delete=0 has no restrictions on what he is 
>able to do in the system. He would be allowed to do anything in an area of 
>the data warehouse or basic code for which he has a valid password number.
>
>As permissions ascend, the limitations on available options increase. For 
>now, a user
>
>with Read=256, Insert=256, & Delete=256 is the most restricted 
>user****(such as a )
>
>named customer. Priviledged users can specify the levels which limit
>
>the use of each operation. This means that an administrator (or
>
>superuser with premissions 0,0,0) could grant full access to all users
>
>or specify any number of arbitrary groups to partition users according
>
>to permission levels and accessible options. It will be meaningful for
>
>the remainder of this document to describe all operations from the
>
>perspective of a system administrator to detail each included function
>
>and feature. Every user with ***(more restrictive) permission levels will 
>have
>
>diminished access according to the administrator's designation.
>
>For a user to be able to read a protected page (or view a particular
>
>dynamic image), the user must have a Read permission level that is less
>
>than or equal to the Read ***(permission) level associated with the page 
>(or image).
>
>For a user to be able to overwrite ***(data or code or an image on) a 
>protected page, the user must have an Insert permission level and a Delete 
>permission level that are both
>
>less than or equal to the ***(security) levels associated with the page.

>       The basis of all web sites is HTML, and that HTML is used to

>       Producing any kind of Web site, and e-commerce ones in particular,

>elements like toolbars or navigation bars to help guide your users around 
>your site. There are different ways of getting round the problems of these 
>constant elements, frequently frames are used for this purpose, and the new 
>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be used to similar effect. I've even seen

>
>       However, for an E-Commerce site there are extra complications, most 
>of time you'll be building sections of the page dynamically based on 
>searches, user selections and preferences.
>
>       Before we get on to the complexities of dynamically driven sites,

>Side Includes (SSI) to build up the pages. Understanding the basics of SSI 
>will help us to understand how to use and employ templates in just but 
>about solution. We'll use my writing website, www.mcwords.com, which was 
>actually designed with SSI specifically in mind as our example.
>
>       The home page looks like this:
>
>
>
>       Whilst the actual to build that page is short and sweet:
>
><HTML>
><HEAD>
><TITLE>MCwords</TITLE>
><!--#include virtual="/ssi/topbar.html" -->
><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100%>
><tr>
><td width="66%" valign=top>
><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=100%>
><!--#include virtual="/ssi/mainnewspanel.shtml" -->
><!--#include virtual="/archive/summary.html" -->
></table>
></td>
><td width="34%" valign=top>
><table width="100%" border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
><!--#include virtual="/ssi/updatepanel.html" -->
><!--#include virtual="/ssi/downloadpanel.html" -->
><!--#include virtual="/ssi/dreamhostad.html" -->
></table>
></td>
></tr>
></table>
><!--#include virtual="/ssi/tagline.html" -->
>
>       Aside from some minor formatting, the bulk of the code is actually 
>taken up by SSI include directives which import the main logo and top 
>navigation panel, the body section, a side section and the trailing 
>information. In essence what we've got here is a page made up of five 
>distinct sections, the surrounding template gives us our base-the page 
>title and main table, whilst the imported sections handle everything else.
>
>       Configuring Apache
>       For this to work correctly, you need to have Apache configured first 
>to handle SSI, and then to use the index.shtml file as a default. This is 
>fairly straightforward. To enable SSI, enable the Includes directive on a 
>directory:
>
><Directory /usr/local/http/webs/mcwords>
>         Options +Includes
></Directory>
>
>       Then tell Apache which files to parse for SSI commands. The general 
>consensus is to use files with an extension of .shtml, which you configure 
>like this:
>
>AddType text/html .shtml
>AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
>
>       Finally, you need to update the DirectoryIndex option:
>
>DirectoryIndex index.shtml index.html
>       Element Design
>       Our sample page is actually duplicated across the entire site, I use 
>the sample basic template and just change the include directive to include 
>the information I want. Aside from the obvious benefits of the things like 
>a consistent top bar, I can also use the same body elements and sidebar 
>elements in other pages. For example the main heading page news items can 
>be used as introductory panels for the individual sections and so on.
>
>       For E-Commerce sites you can employ the same basic tactics for 
>search fields, control panels and even product information, although it's 
>more likely that will be driven from a scripting language than static HTML. 
>We'll actually look at techniques for introducing dynamic elements through 
>our templates in moment.
>
>       The trick to handling all of this effectively is to create each 
>included element and as a standalone component. That way the element is 
>both standalone--in that it could be displayed essentially on its own 
>without any further window dressing--and able to be integrated without 
>needing any other files or window dressing to make it work.
>
>       For example, take the panel on the right; this is a single table 
>cell, which itself has an embedded table. The "Recent Site Updates" will be 
>a new row of that table, so the code looks like this:
>
><tr>
><td width=5>&nbsp;</td>
><td bgcolor="#ff0000" align=center><font face="Arial,Helvetica" 
>color="#ffffff"><b>Recent Site Updates</b></font></td>
></tr>
><tr>
><td width=5>&nbsp;</td>
><td>

>
>       That's everything--the new table row, the header for the section, 
>and the body, as well as the trailing HTML code to close those elements 
>off. This keeps the clutter and management of the elements out of the main 
>files and instead inside the individual components.
>
>       Producing Your Design
>       The easiest way to design your site when producing a system like 
>this is to actually create a static page--or series of pages if you are 
>using frames--and then try to logically split that up.
>
>       Once you have the individual elements, then optimize them to keep 
>the sizes down to a minimum (this helps your server and your prospective 
>clients). Finally, use the final version to produce templates that can then 
>be duplicated and used for all the different includes that you need to make 
>your site.
>
>       How you design and layout your site is entirely up to you, and 
>really an HTML, not Apache, issue, so I'll leave that as an exercise for 
>the reader.
>
>       Directory Organization
>       Just before we look at some of the funkier things you can do with 
>SSI and template driven pages, it's worth just covering the basics of your 
>directory layout. On my site, I have a single directory at the top level 
>called ssi, this contains all of the core components like the top bar, 
>bottom tag line and the main panels on the right hand side. The main body 
>of the content is then taken from the corresponding directories.
>
>       Although this kind of layout is not particularly unique or clever, 
>it does make the whole process a lot easier. It also ensures that I can 
>easily identify the elements that I want to include. This will become 
>particularly important as we start to embed different elements through our 
>script engines.
>
>       Quasi-Dynamic Content
>       Up to now, we've strictly been dealing with static pages. Although 
>it's possible that some of your content will be static based, it's highly 
>unlikely that your entire site will be able to make direct use of SHTML 
>pages. We'll be looking at how to build entirely script-driven sites that 
>employ templates in the next article. Until then, we can actually introduce 
>some further dynamic content without resorting to a full script.
>
>       Using the exec SSI directive we can execute a CGI script instead of 
>embedding a static HTML file. Most sites actually use this feature to 
>include a site counter, but it can be used in any situation where you want 
>some dynamic content. On my site I've used this as a way of introducing 
>some random elements into the various side panels that would otherwise have 
>to be manually selected on each page.
>
>       The script is pretty simple; it only has to select a file from a

>       This is the third in a three-article series about Server Side 
>Includes, or SSI. In the first article, I discussed configuring your Apache 
>server to permit SSI. In the second article, I gave some examples of how 
>you might use SSI to add dynamic content to your web pages. In this 
>article, I'll talk about some of the advanced features available with 
>Server Side Includes.
>
>       (Note: Most of the features discussed in this article are only 
>available to you if you are running Apache 1.2 or later. Of course, if you 
>are not running Apache 1.2 or later, you need to upgrade immediately, if 
>not sooner. Go on. Do it now. We'll wait.)
>
>       Setting Variables
>       Using the set attribute, you can set variables for later use. We'll 
>need this later in the discussion, so we'll talk about this here. The 
>syntax of this is as follows:
>
>         <!--#set var="name" value="Rich" -->
>       In addition to merely setting values literally like that, you can 
>use any other variable, including, for example, environment variables, or 
>some of the variables we discussed in the last article (like LAST_MODIFIED, 
>for example) to give values to your variables. You will specify that 
>something is a variable, rather than a literal string, by using the dollar 
>sign ($) before the name of the variable:
>
>        <!--#set var="modified" value="$LAST_MODIFIED" -->
>       To put a literal dollar sign into the value of your variable, you 
>need to escape the dollar sign with a backslash:
>
>        <!--#set var="cost" value="\$100" -->
>       Finally, if you want to put a variable in the midst of a longer 
>string, and there's a chance that the name of the variable will run up 
>against some other characters, and thus be confused with those characters, 
>you can place the name of the variable in braces, to remove this confusion. 
>(It's hard to come up with a really good example of this, but hopefully 
>you'll get the point.) To wit:
>
>        <!--#set var="date" value="${DATE_LOCAL}_${DATE_GMT}" -->
>       Conditional Expressions
>       Now that we have variables and are able to set and compare their 
>values, we can use them to express conditionals. This lets SSI be a tiny 
>programming languages of sorts. mod_include provides an if, elif, else, 
>endif structure for building conditional statements. This allows you to 
>effectively generate multiple logical pages out of one actual page.
>
>       The structure of this conditional construct is:
>
>     <!--#if expr="test_condition" -->
>     <!--#elif expr="test_condition" -->
>     <!--#else -->
>     <!--#endif -->
>       A test_condition can be any sort of logical comparison--either 
>comparing values to one another, or testing the "truth" of a particular 
>value. (A given string is true if it is nonempty.) For a full list of the 
>comparison operators available to you, see the mod_include documentation. 
>Here are some examples of how one might use this construct.
>
>       In your configuration file, you could put the following line:
>
>         BrowserMatchNoCase macintosh Mac
>         BrowserMatchNoCase MSIE InternetExplorer
>       This will set environment variables Mac and InternetExplorer to 
>true, if the client is running Internet Explorer on a Macintosh.
>
>       Then, in your SSI-enabled document, you might do the following:
>
>         <!--#if expr="${Mac} && ${InternetExplorer} -->
>         Apologetic text goes here
>         <!--#else -->
>         Cool JavaScript code goes here
>         <!--#endif -->
>       Not that I have anything against IE on Macs--I just struggled for a 
>few hours last week trying to get some JavaScript working on IE on a Mac, 
>when it was working everywhere else. The above was the interim workaround.
>
>       Any other variable (either ones that you define, or normal 
>enviroment variables) can be used in conditional statements. With Apache's 
>ability to set environment variables with the SetEnvIf directives, and 
>other related directives, this functionality can let you do some pretty 
>involved dynamic stuff without ever resorting to CGI.
>
>       Conclusion
>       SSI is certainly not a replacement for CGI, or other technologies 
>used for generating dynamic web pages. But it is certainly a great way to 
>add small amounts of dynamic content to pages, without doing a lot of extra 
>work.
>
>       See the docs on mod_include for more information on using SSI.

>Hey Len.
>  I just sent you an invoice for last week.  I'm not sure if it contains 
>everything it should as I'm not sure exactly what components are required 
>for a thoroughly detailed document of that nature.  If it needs to reflect 
>any information I have neglected, please reply as soon as possible so that 
>we can get it fixed and I can get payed.  Thanks much.
>  Regarding the state of the 800Telephone site:
>    In the past 48 hours, I have completely revamped the webserver 
>configuration, modified MySQL's internal configuration and permission 
>structure for the purpose of establishing OpenMerchant with all the 
>required access correctly on the server.  After innumberable roadblocks and 
>associated struggles, I seem to have gotten everything in place.  It may be 
>slightly precarious as I had to try a ton of possible configurations to get 
>everything to happily coexist.  I need to take a break for a while but I'll 
>be back at it tonight (at which time I'll focus on integrating the tables 
>from last week with the ones already defined by OpenMerchant and I'll 
>further customize OM to become 800Tele).  To see the current website (that 
>Brian made) please go to:
>  http://24.16.72.254/
>and if you would like to see the detailed example that comes with 
>OpenMerchant, please go to:
>  http://24.16.72.254/cgi-bin/om/admin/login.cgi
>and supply username as "admin" and password "opensales" to view the current 
>OpenMerchant functionality on the 800Telephone server.  Please reply with 
>comments or recommendations.  I'll address them late tonight as I need some 
>sleep.  Have a good day.  TTFN & Shalom.

April 25

Len,
I did not start arguing with you.  I did not agree to any previous proposal 
(other than $32/hr for my services).  You have never offered me $500 per 
week.  You insult my integrity and my loyalty at every opportunity but I 
have not been deficient in either.  I'm afraid your perception of the past 
events does not coincide with mine so I thought it might be helpful if I 
relate what has happened so far from my perspective:
1) You agreed to hire me for $32 / hour to write code for you.
2) You did not have any development environment so (after significant 
discussion) I recommended that you establish your own server.  You had me 
perform cost analysis and make recommendations and phone calls to price 
several differing server options.  (Since this isn't coding, maybe it isn't 
considered work according to our initial agreement but it definitely was 
something I wouldn't have done in my free time and it was certainly job 
related research/analysis based on my hardware experience/expertise)
3) We ventured to local electronics stores for further server hardware 
options, operating system software, and reference materials.
4) You decided to purchase a computer that was not designed to be a server 
at all which came installed with Windows98.  You also bought RedHat 6.2 
separately.
5) The network card in the Windows98 computer you bought did not work with 
Linux so I gave you mine.
6) We installed RedHat and I configured the network settings, server 
software, and user permissions.
7) You took your old hub back and gave me a new one the next day (which 
works fine... Thank you).
8) I downloaded, installed, and correctly configured MySQL onto the server.
9) We discussed the possibility that I develop the entire backend to the 
800Telephone system myself.
10) You asked how much I need to live and I replied "$500/wk" which I 
quickly followed with the qualification that even though I could live off so 
little money, that doesn't mean I would like to.  My objective was not to 
get payed as little as possible to do as much work as possible.  I have been 
and am glad to work hard to be nicely paid.
11) We discussed the possibility of $1000/wk. which sounded much closer to 
what I'd like to be paid (compared to the minimum I could afford to live 
on).  You stipulated that you would pay that rate for 10 weeks and that I'd 
be obligated to complete the project for free if it required more time.  You 
also suggested that you'd keep me busy for the entire 10 weeks if I finished 
early.
12) We made no official agreement.  No proposal was written down in any way.
13) I needed to examine the requirements of the project before I could begin 
to determine my ability to complete it.
14) I needed to determine my ability to complete the project before I could 
possibly arrive at a reasonable or exact completion time frame.
15) I reviewed the documents last night and replied today (as I said I 
would) with my concerns; the biggest of which was the possibility that the 
project would require more than 10 weeks to complete and that I would have 
to work for free to complete it.
16) You replied upset with me as though I had gone and changed the agreement 
after shaking your hand on some specific deal to complete the project for 
you (which I never did).  I've been as clear and fair and direct with you as 
I can possibly be.  I haven't promised more than I could deliver and I've 
already demonstrated competence in areas that you did not anticipate when 
you initially hired me (namely my ability to evaluate server-related 
hardware options, to setup and configure server software, to administrate a 
server, and to develop databases)
17) I replied and explained that I hadn't agreed to anything regarding 
developing all of the 800Telephone system (despite what you may have 
thought) because I wasn't ever equipped to do so since I had never read what 
the system needed to do before last night.
18) You replied that we are arguing and that you've been doing me favors all 
along and I haven't seen it that way and that I can get $750/wk for as long 
as it takes or $10k for the whole job and that programmers are terrible to 
deal with because of their one-way aspirations

...which basically brings us up to date...
Now... you know I wanted to work for no less than $32/hr from the outset of 
our relationship.  The two offers you seem to have made me are basically 
$10k for work that may take longer than 10 weeks or $750 / week for as long 
as it takes.  Now if we consider these two possibilities, it seems clear 
that you are not interested in paying me what we initially agreed to 
($32/hr) even if I am more valuable than a simple coder to you.  Let us say 
that a 10k contract is signed and work is completed in 10 weeks... that 
works out to $25/hr. if I only work 40 hours per week... in all likelihood, 
I would work nearly twice that making my hourly rate somewhere near $15/hr.  
If the job were to take longer than 10 weeks (and therefore I have to finish 
the remainder without any further compensation), clearly this hourly rate 
would come closer to $10/hr.  When I try to explain to you that I don't want 
to be payed so little for my future efforts, you retaliate with your second 
option of $750/wk. and insults toward the programming community in general.  
I have not been trying to pull a fast one on you here.  You wanted to hire 
me and every opportunity you get, you try to get me to agree to be payed as 
little as possible.  Maybe you don't realize you're doing this.  Maybe you 
do intend to pay me as little as possible to limit your own business costs.  
I don't know which it is but let me make things as clear as I can:
  I can afford to live off $500 / wk.
  I can make at least $500 / wk. doing data entry or web design almost 
anywhere.
  I will not be happy making $500 / wk (~$12.50/hr.).
  $1000 / wk. (~$25/hr.) is still less than I would like to make.
  Technical experience similar to mine often goes for $45+/hr. today.
  I have asked to be payed at least $32/hr.

Now I see three basic options for our business relationship in the future:
  1) You pay me $480 ($32/hr. x 15 hours) for the work I have done for you 
thus far and we both go our separate ways.
  2) You pay me $32/hr. to continue to work for you and my responsibilities 
can include administration of your server, database design and 
implementation, Perl/CGI coding, and OpenMerchant configuration/enhancement 
development.  I could be very similar to a direct employee devoted to 
constructing whatever you need and want as quickly and completely as I am 
able.
  3) You treat me more like a distant programming firm hired to develop the 
underlying code for your entire 800Telephone system.  If this is the 
arrangement, then (after further deliberations) we may agree that the entire 
project is worth $10k and that total development time can span no longer 
than 10 weeks.  That would also mean that completion of the project in less 
than 10 weeks still entitles me to the full price stipulated in the contract 
($10k).

These are the only three options that seem fair to me.  Please choose one of 
them when you have time or comment if none are adequate for you.  Thanks.  
TTFN & Shalom.

-Pip

p.s. I have removed users "vijay" and "test" from the server as per your 
request.

June 1

Hey Len,
I just wanted to give you an update on my progress.  After the preliminary 
testing on Tue. and a stronger one yesterday afternoon, it became apparent 
that security concerns (in regards to database access) hadn't been 
sufficiently addressed.  I thought of ways to circumvent the security 
measures originally developed.  I researched and read for almost 2 hours 
last night about CGI security methods and special procedures for state 
retention.  I originally had the permissions residing within the same 
database as the rest of the data (these permissions determine who can access 
anything whatsoever from databases to users to actual data records to 
files).  Last night I designed two solutions and after much consideration, I 
decided on one and began coding it (to be more secure this time around).  
That's what I'm working on right now.  Previously, with some creative html 
submission, users could override their own permission level and with that 
access, simply set their permissions higher which would enable everything to 
be compromised.  The new design basically segregates each level according to 
how damaging a security breach could be.  This means that basically only the 
super user can access the database and user permission tables.  I've also 
had to add a new criterion for testing which enables partial creations.  
This has taken a lot of time since all the code tests need to reflect this 
new field too and it's not behaving properly just yet.  This new structure 
should prove much more reliable and secure.  I'm planning to get this all 
done by tonight (hopefully bugs fixed too).  I've also done some server 
maintenance while you were gone which removed the openmerchant virtual host 
and other settings which were involved with the development version of that. 
  I've left most of the files on the server (in case we can benefit from 
their code or data structures etc.) but I've removed them from the apache 
configuration and cleaned up the web server operation methods.  I've also 
looked at Dynamic.net this week to see if we could setup 
len@800telephone.com (& pip@800 etc.)through them and it seems that all of 
their email packages cost money and aren't included with most of the hosting 
options.  If you were emailed special instructions on what services are 
included with our hosting package or how to specifically setup email 
aliases, please forward them to me so I can make more progress on that 
front.  I read and fiddled for a while with how to setup the required email 
services directly from the 800tele server but I didn't get a chance to 
configure them completely because I'm still not quite sure where all the 
proper settings files are and even if I could get them working perfectly 
right now (probably with forwarding from len@800 to leonard3@home etc.), it 
would be useless since mail sent to an @800tele address will be going to 
dynamic.net until they alias to our server or we can configure theirs to 
forward directly.  Once the mail could get through, I'll work on it more 
diligently but I couldn't justify spending more than an hour or two on it 
this week since I can't test it yet and it won't work until dynamic is setup 
for the addresses anyway.  I've had a lot of other code on my mind too.  
I've finally gotten my harddrives working correctly without creating SCSI 
bus errors.  I'd be coding on my floor computer while the other one was 
formatting the 18GB drive (for almost 2 hours) which had to be done 3 times 
before it would actually take an Operating System installation.  Now my main 
computer is running solidly (with the case cover on and everything) and so 
is the floor one.  I've gotten a ton done this week.  I don't have too much 
more before this ModifyMySQL module is working with the new design and is 
actually safe from cracking (or at least far more secure than the original). 
  Of course I'd like to have a testable version of it late this afternoon or 
early this evening.  If I get such a version up (that's not frighteningly 
buggy), I'll send you another email with a link to it.  Anyway, this is what 
I've been doing and what I'm working on now.  I hope your trip was as good 
as possible.  Talk to you soon.  TTFN & Shalom.

-Pip

June 9

You don't need to apologize for renting an office.  You should understand 
that you did it because you wanted to.  You may have been slightly 
influenced by my affirmation that working from offices can be better than 
most other options.  It was not my decision to make.  I did not see the 
place or know anything about it while you were deciding and I haven't 
hesitated to say repeatedly (even boringly so) that all I really care about 
is bandwidth.  Maybe you've never heard me or you don't believe me.  You can 
even choose to insult me and say that I would never dream of "helping" you 
out in any way.  You can yell at me and tell me that I never solve problems 
and that I only tell you that things can't be done.  You need to understand 
that YOU got this office.  I did not twist your arm.  I did not spend or 
waste your money.  I have never lied to you about what an office means to 
me.  I told you I'd be glad to work there IFF (which means if and only if) 
there was a fast internet connection.  That was true when I told you and it 
remains.  I stream nearly cd quality music at almost all times.  I cannot 
during the peak cable modem usage saturation times during most evenings.  
The throughput provided by my cable modem is not enough for me.  I prefer 
coding while listening to certain mp3 radio stations.  I code with usually 7 
or 8 simultaneous open connections to servers.  I cannot work from a 
telephone-based 56k modem.  Maybe you can call it "needing to make 
sacrifices" because it's something that you know you're able to do since you 
just need to check some websites and send some email once in a while.  I 
understand that I cannot exist like that.  If you wanted to hire me as your 
direct employee for 56k+/year, I'd work wherever you want me to.  If you 
wanted me to underproduce until we could "afford" sufficient accomodations 
or ones that even compete with the service we already have established in 
our residences, you would be in a position to make that decision.  Since 
that is not going to happen, I have to be productive considering how much 
remains to be done.  I have to be well connected all the time to be 
productive.  It is simple and clear to me.  You choose to accuse me of being 
unwilling to "lift a finger" to help you as if I don't write code as 
carefully and thoroughly and diligently as I can control my mind to do.  I 
want to do a good job and I want to get payed.  If your intent is to insult 
me and irritate me, your tactics will only serve to denegrate my morale and 
consequently my effectiveness.  You may choose to see red over this issue 
(or any other for that matter) but I hope you can see that I have not misled 
you.  If anything, I've been generous to reinforce as many times as I have, 
how important a T1 line is to me and how inadequate and annoying I find 
anything less to be.  Please digest this mail and respond if you would like 
to.  I don't want to have a bad relationship with you ... but I also am 
unwilling to take abuse when it's undeserved.  You even threaten me subtly 
below with cracks about learning by your error and everything happening for 
the best.  In your mind, I do you no favors and therefore you won't do any 
for me.  What you don't see is that I'm trying to get work done.  I'm not 
trying to sit in an office with no access and twiddle my thumbs or play 
video games and listen to music all day.  I don't appreciate it when my hard 
work, in fact my dedication, is insulted ... and then I'm threatened by some 
unwillingness of my employer to be remotely helpful in the future.  Maybe 
you should reconsider how to best get things done.  If you're convinced that 
you're way is always the only right way, you're really the only one you can 
rely upon.  You need to draw your own graphics and write your own code 
because nobody is going to meet your standards for creativity and 
inventiveness and your 7 day work ethic and all the other standards that you 
hold yourself to and can accuse the rest of the world of failing in.  I 
doubt you even can hear or understand much of what I say because you're so 
opinionated and stubborn.  I have been trying to work with you.  You have 
been far more hostile towards me on several occassions, than I have ever 
been towards you.  I'd like to work with you so that, together, we can 
complete this contract.  I would like to provide you with highly functional 
and configurable software so that you can be happy (if that's possible 
before you've made money), I can pay my rent and afford to repair my Jeep, 
and we can both decide what happens from there.  If you would like me to 
stick around for any sort of duration beyond my current obligation, I 
suggest you swallow your shallow apologies and try to understand where I'm 
coming from (as I do for you) so that we can understand each other better 
and accomplish something useful and valuable.  Maybe you don't care if I 
stick around because you think I have no loyalty or that I don't work 
hard... I won't even lift a finger after all (except to type thousands of 
stupid characters huh?).  If you really think those things, then you just 
don't know me and the reason you don't know me is that you haven't tried to 
know me.  If you don't really think those things, then you should not say 
them because they are destructive and do not accomplish anything productive 
whatsoever.  I don't need tension.  Hopefully we can meet on Sunday at 11 to 
discuss everything nicely.  I would be pleased if I could receive a check 
then.  Thank you.  TTFN & Shalom.

p.s. I hope you can enjoy some pleasant restfulness this Shabbat.

I don't "surf" while I code despite what you may think.  You don't know how 
I work and you don't care to ask.  I usually have three test browsers open 
to different stages of the module's progression and usually three or four 
live connections to the server or to an indexed reference or other sample 
source.  I dive into code while I'm working on it.  Just because you think 
you understand does not mean that you know what's going on.

Talking to a friend casually saying "I'm working on an interface to MySQL" 
is hardly a novel idea or a trade secret.  It is also very different from 
saying "I have accomplished work making Mysql more usable for the employees 
of 800telephone.com in this way and this way and this way."

I've added "anita" as a user on the server and made duplicates of each of 
the graphic files in her home directory so that she will have access to 
everything Brian has done (which are the only graphics and flash that I have 
ever had copies of).  If Murray sends me anything, I'll be glad to send her 
a copy of it as well.  Since I'm probably going to meet her shortly, I'll 
assign her password then.

Relax... I didn't build my own website... I needed to take a break from 
coding so I started reinstalling Debian last week.  It werked.  I haven't 
been tweaking it or loving it or anything like you must imagine.  I am 
interested in completing the contract.  You say the facts suggest I'm 
somehow "not trying" ... well I don't know what facts you're referencing but 
they are not readily apparent to me considering I am the one who's werk is 
in question here and I know that I'm getting as much done as I can.  I've 
attached the archive again.  Please let me know if it still doesn't send 
properly.  Also... could you reply with the best email address for Matt 
Tyson so I can send a copy to that particular one and not guess at three of 
them.  Thanks.  TTFN.

Just for your notes... basic (and even some complex) data input has been 
functional for two weeks... it just has not been synchronized with the 
password module to protect that input.  It works.  It's not safe yet.  
Pretty simple.  TTFN.

p.s. This isn't an argument.  It's an explanation.

I'm guessing that the attachment is being rejected by Hotmail's qsend 
program due to the file size exceeding 1MB.  If the last email attachment 
was successful, you can ignore this but I've taken the liberty to add the 
archive file to the server and provided a link at the bottom of Brian's old 
flash page.  You can download the archive from anywhere (if you have the 
password) by going to:
  http://800telephone.com
and entering the password.  That will take you to the old flash page... and 
at the very bottom, I've added a link to the archive file with download 
directions.  I'd be glad to try to attach the file in a mail to Matt Tyson 
again if you would like.  Please reply with which address of his is 
preferrable.  TTFN.

Hello Len.  I wanted to send an update before I head off to the airport.  
I've been werking all night and this is what I did:
  I got all subdirectories in PageNames to work correctly (that is with or 
without a / before the path)
  I made a very special public clause for protected files that have a 
PageName which begins with img/ or /img/ so that they can be placed in a 
folder specifically for graphics and referencable from any html document on 
the server (including other dynamic ones which is really the whole point).
  I extended the default PageName functionality so that if none is supplied 
and a local file is selected for upload (when creating a new protected file 
on the server), it extracts the local file name for use as the server's 
PageName.
  I also enabled detection of .gif or .jpg as default upload files so that 
they automatically get /img/ prepended so that they will automatically be 
accessible as graphics for other pages.  To make uploaded graphics 
inaccessible, you must supply a PageName when uploading that does not begin 
with img/ or /img/.
  I further debugged the transition from ' in the dynamic accesses over to ~ 
(accent to tilde).
  I completed the ability for any user to change their hint or password 
online securely (with all the redundancy and correct error messages etc.).
  I fixed a bug with the password timeout which would allow create and 
delete functionality to circumvent the idle period limitations.
  I corrected the hostname setting on the server in preparation for the 
repointing of the domain.
  I adjusted the date and time which are local to the server so that the 
timed lockout test can be accurate.  The server was defaulted to some time 
last year and a few hours off before so they should be correct now.
  I wrote portions of user and permission level alteration code so that 
database updates (for users, permissions, and end-customer-bound data 
tables) can be updated securely.
  I was werking on secure data update/insert and user 
security/administration functions when it became apparent that a particular 
Perl module would be helpful for database integration (Data::DataTables).  
When retrieving this module (which is relatively small and should have been 
a quick installation), the installation utility detected that a newer 
version of Perl was available and automatically proceeded to download and 
install that.  Our original version of Perl was something like 5.0.0.3 and 
the newest one (which was just released a week or two ago IIRC) is version 
5.6.  This began at around 4:00am and ran for nearly half an hour.  When it 
completed, the server stopped responding (and presumably hard-crashed).  I 
haven't been able to access the development server since (through http, 
telnet, or ftp).  I've been trying to write more code locally but I have had 
no way to test anything for the past two hours.  I've tried to probe the 
server numerous times hoping that it isn't totally locked up but it hasn't 
responded.  I must leave for the LAX in less than 1 hour.  I've accomplished 
everything I could tonight.  Hopefully we can resolve the server problem 
promptly when I return next week.  I wasn't doing anything anomolous tonight 
nor the other time the server crashed.  If the filesystem indeed needs to be 
rebuilt again, I think it is apparent that the hardware components in the 
development server are sub-par and should be replaced with higher quality 
equipment.  The most likely culprits of such recurring failures would be (in 
order of likelihood) a poorly manufactured hard drive, defective IDE cables, 
faulty memory modules (RAM), or a deficient disk controller (EIDE) on the 
motherboard.  Hopefully the problem did not result in filesystem corruption 
as it did last time so the repair can be quick and painless.  Anita should 
be able to construct pages (based on what we discussed earlier this week) to 
display content for preliminary html documents like the touchtone and 
product category pages.  Those can be developed locally on her workstation 
until we can re-establish access to the development server.  I really am 
amazed that this happened just before I'm leaving and have been hoping that 
the server would come back up but it doesn't look like that's happening.  
I'll probably be in touch on Tuesday as soon as I can wake up.  Have a good 
weekend if possible.  TTFN & Shalom.

-PipTigger

p.s. Please forward this to Anita or fill her in as to the changes that have 
been made in the system so that the briefing next week can be brief.  I was 
going to cc this mail to her but I realized that it might contain some 
things that you wouldn't want her to see so I figured you can determine 
that.  If you would like, next week I'll distill this email down to just the 
details of the system changes as they pertain to her and making pages in 
general.  Let me know.  Thanks.

June 20 -> AnnDrew@aol.com

Wow!  Thank you.  I take it Len fired you while I was gone?  I just got back 
from Wisconsin and really wasn't hoping to be without companionship so soon. 
  My brother was well while I was there but he began radiation treatment 
again today so I got to see him at his best (while he took a week off 
treatments) but I'd like to be there for him during the toughest time too if 
I could.  I have a lot of expenses though so I have to try to get paid (and 
not sued) if at all possible in this current situation.  Sorry Len felt the 
need to berate you at every opportunity.  I feel like I have to apologize 
for his brazen cruelty too often.  He's usually just not a nice man and I 
don't like to be around him because he's unkind to just about everyone.  I 
hope you do well in your future endeavors and I greatly appreciate your 
sweetness and willingness to be a sensitive soul should I need some gentle 
encouragement.  Likewise, if you should have need for me to do the same for 
you, I would be glad to.  TTFN & Shalom.

Hey Len.
    I've had a hideous time with DBI tonight.  I thought all I'd have to do 
to be up and running again was to restart the MySQL server but that didn't 
work and I've tried a ton of widely varied things to get it to run.  After 
many failed attempts at configuring different modules and reading many help 
texts on the subject, I recompiled MySQL and Perl5.6 directly from online 
source code archives in order to obtain coherent binary versions which 
dynamically link to common (and compatible) components.  Last week's crash 
ruined some dependencies which couldn't be easily reconstructed.  I 
installed the latest DBI and finally configured, tested, and installed the 
correct drivers for MySQL to interface with DBI.  All of the components are 
operational and all the old code is (finally) running again.
    I've saved the source code to the transactional enhancement to MySQL 
that you pointed me to however, I have been inspecting it for the past half 
hour and their online documentation and I've realized that it would not be a 
simple solution for us at this point.  They have their own modules to 
interface with MySQL called Berkeley DB & DB_FILE which are significantly 
different from DBI.  Their modules for MySQL are only in an experimental 
stage right now so they are not even as developed as DBI's driver.  
Basically, much of the database code would need to be rewritten if we wanted 
to utilize Berkeley DB instead of DBI to access MySQL.  I'm really tired so 
I may not think the task is so daunting once I check it out more thoroughly 
(and clear-headedly) tomorrow but it seems like it would be a ton of extra 
work to get their transactional layer implemented into our system.
    I've tried to work further on the secure data update (now that the 
database is accessible again) so that I can get that running and then 
section off a stable demo with all of the secure core functions in place so 
that we can have a nice demo... but I'm nodding off because the sun is up 
and I've been pounding my head against the server configuration all night.  
I'm trying to stay awake to get more done before I fall asleep but I wanted 
to send you this email to let you know what has happened and that I'll 
probably wake up around 1 or 2 pm so I'll give you a call then.  TTFN.

-Pip

p.s. Now, at least we have the latest versions of all the software involved.

The new version of Perl was of a different binary compatibility.  It was 
updated automatically while installing another module.  Most users don't 
encounter such difficulties but we have better versions of Perl and MySQL 
now that we've compiled them specifically for our machine.  These files are 
unrelated to the backup I sent to Matt.  The code I've written hasn't 
changed but the libraries they expect to be able to link to became 
unavailable and needed to be reinstalled and configured correctly and it's 
not an easy task.  I didn't expect to need the source code to Perl or to 
have to configure the MySQL code to be able to compile an entirely new 
binary for our purposes since I could not have forseen the automatic 
incompatibility in binaries.  Now that I know, I can go ahead and include 
both of those 5MB source files in the next archive (mushrooming it's size 
over 10 times the original).  It's not really smart to do something like 
that though because it really doesn't save you any time to save large source 
files when there are constantly released newer versions online and any 
reconfiguration of the server would require the server to be online, 
therefore, it will (almost always) make most sense to re-retrieve large 
files needed for server configuration each time you find yourself 
configuring a server so that you can get the most recent ones and because 
there would be a negligable advantage (speed or convenience-wise) by having 
large config files archived on some other PC rather than re-getting the 
files from the code author's archive.  You want to backup a lot of things 
but until we can really backup everything, there are going to be many 
modules which don't make sense to store copies of regularly because when we 
need them again, I'm not going to use the archived ones anyway for the 
reasons stated above.

I downloaded their BerkeleyDB source.  The version of MySQL with the 
experimental drivers is over a month older than the one I compiled last 
night (source-wise).

Sounds good... let's look into a Linux binary backup utility that we can run 
every day or week to save a complete disk prepared for swapping should the 
main experience a failure again.

    I've gotten the multiple data manipulations per form to work correctly.  
I want to test it a little further so that I'm confident it can handle some 
more stressful usage than the initial cases it has passed so far.  This 
broader functionality can make the demonstration much more functional and 
... it will look much more powerful to see many varied operations taking 
place with each dynamic page access (and all securely too).
    I've examined the ForwardSQL page for the past 15 minutes and it hardly 
seems to be worthwhile to me.  The site says that they're built on Open 
Standards but that doesn't mean that their souce code is open or available.  
They are selling the package for $950.  It is a web-based MySQL 
administration package (similar to the one I was working on before) that 
provides an html frontend for table creation/modification/removal etc.  It 
does not create dynamic web pages from the data elements.  It enables you 
(or any user) to modify the database without writing MySQL code directly.  I 
didn't see a mention of transactions or rollbacks.  On the overview page, 
they suggest that you can store updates in a temporary table for review 
before they are committed but this can be done easily in any database.  
Maybe I missed something wonderful about it but ForwardSQL seems to just be 
a closed source front end to MySQL that we don't really need (since our 
tables are already almost complete, we have the hard code which defined 
them, and we have dynamic reads, updates, and deletes already working 
correctly).  Let me know if you have a different perspective.
    Tonight, I intend to test the multiple process handling thoroughly 
before I'm ready to leave it alone as done and stable for future usage.  
Then I want to add the ability to modify user and page permissions directly 
integrated into the edit screens.  The method for doing this right now is 
rather convoluted so a simplification and localization of edit functionality 
would be highly worthwhile for demonstrative and usage purposes.  Then I'll 
write the pages for the demo section and duplicate everything into a stable 
testable area.  After that, I want to try to configure the mailer program on 
the server so that it allows mails to be relayed from a script to a remote 
email address.  The Perl modules for this are installed and configured 
correctly and the code I've written compiles and runs fine but the mailer 
tool on the server is unwilling to send the mail off when it receives it 
from the script.  I've tried to modify the configuration files before with 
no success so I'm hoping to read some documentation to figure out how to 
enable the proper relaying functionality or to install a more cooperative 
mailer program if that doesn't work.
    The pages Anita created could be incorporated into the dynamic 
infrastructure (for realistic testing as well as demonstration purposes).  
Could I please get copies of her html and graphics to test with?  Hopefully 
we can convene tomorrow afternoon to examine the demonstration and make it 
more useful.  After the demo is in a good and steady place, I intend to 
examine Perl credit card modules.  Hopefully next week, we can describe most 
of the initial pages according to the input and output tables for 
construction by a graphics person.  I hope you like the demo a lot.  Talk to 
you tomorrow when I awake.  TTFN & Shalom.

I have read this carefully and I have mixed feelings about it.  Stable 
builds of opensource software end in an even sub-version number if they are 
reliable and an odd one if they are developmental/unstable/implementing beta 
features etc.  This means that Perl version 5.6 is a stable release that 
they want normal people to use as it has passed all the regression testing 
and meets all their stability requirements to be used widely.  Perl 5.7 on 
the other hand should only be used by Perl developers who are werking 
towards Perl 5.8 since it has not likely passed all the tests and is the 
ground to experiment with potential new implementations or features.  Perl 
5.7 might crash everytime you do something simple (depending on what 
developmental features were compiled into the particular build you got).  
The version of MySQL that we are currently using is the most recent stable 
version that I saw when I downloaded it (version 3.22.32).  Any MySQL driver 
that is in the under-development (3.23.xx) tree may not be stable or 
reliable.  Since we are in a development phase of 800Tele, I wouldn't worry 
too much if the database server crashed once in a while but if the 
BerkeleyDB component never makes it into a stable release build of MySQL 
(like the upcoming 3.24), I might be worried about employing a database 
suite that is known to not have been held to the same standards as release 
versions.  We may develop on 3.23.xx and find it to be perfectly stable and 
then it might not be a concern.  My recommendation is to stick with database 
engines that are most likely to be very stable.  With that in mind, would 
you like me to install this development version of MySQL (3.23.18) so that 
we can see how difficult it will be to enable our code to benefit from the 
transactional features mentioned by Mike?  TTFN & Shalom.

Thanks for the card.  I cannot open the statistics attachment you sent 
because it is in a Word for Windows 2.0 format.  Thanks for unsubscription 
info.  I'm almost done with the thorough documentation for the demo.  I need 
to test my mailer script more thoroughly but it looks like it should serve 
our purposes nicely.  I have two methods for cookies and I'm weighing the 
benefits of each.  I'll send you a comprehensive update once these are 
decided upon.  I've begun designing parts of the vendor components.  I'm 
probably going to fall asleep soon.  I've also written some selection table 
code that handles color requests.  The posts I made about the mailer routine 
did not yield fruitful responses so I'm forgoing the library (which isn't 
working at all) for a homecooked workaround that can perform similarly once 
it receives a bit more attention.  I'll call you this afternoon.  TTFN.

-Pip

Obviously you knew a plain text version would be readable if your MS Word 
version was not so I don't believe it required spelling out as you suggest.

I just woke up about an hour ago and checked my email as I said I would.  
I've downloaded the developmental version of MySQL and am preparing to 
uncompress it, configure and compile it, and install it.  I just sent you 
test output of my mailer script.  I want to add options to it so that 
multiple copies can be run simultaneously because we'll need that 
functionality if many emails are generated from the web at the same time.  
I've finished the detailed description of the system (so far).  It's pasted 
down below your mail.  Talk to you later.

This file was created by Pip Stuart on June 28th, 2000 for the purpose
of describing the software functionality developed thus far for
800Telephone.

The system is primarily composed of 3 programs:
    index.cgi - The default script which validates passwords and handles
                all secure administration processing.
    dp.cgi    - This script is a slimmed version of index.cgi which
                specializes in DynamicPages only.  It lets index.cgi
                validate the login and takes the handoff from there.
    pw.pl     - This is utility employed by the above scripts to
                handle an abstracted method for generating and
                processing unique session identification codes.

Almost everything in the system (from users to protected pages to data
fields to images) has 3 different permissions associated with it.  They
are: Read, Insert, and Delete.  The system validation checks each
permission level according to the requested operation.  Lower permission
numbers are more secure which means that a user with permissions
Read=0, Insert=0, & Delete=0 is completely unrestricted.  As permissions
ascend, the limitations on available options increase.  For now, a user
with Read=256, Insert=256, & Delete=256 is the most restricted user
named customer.  Priviledged users can specify the levels which limit
the use of each operation.  This means that an administrator (or
superuser with premissions 0,0,0) could grant full access to all users
or specify any number of arbitrary groups to partition users according
to permission levels and accessible options.  It will be meaningful for
the remainder of this document to describe all operations from the
perspective of a system administrator to detail each included function
and feature.  Every user with poorer permission levels will have
diminished access according to the administrator's designation.

For a user to be able to read a protected page (or view a particular
dynamic image), the user must have a Read permission level that is less
than or equal to the Read level associated with the page (or image).
For a user to be able to overwrite a protected page, the user must have
an Insert permission level and a Delete permission level that are both
less than or equal to the levels associated with the page.
For a user to be able to delete a protected page (or graphic file), the
user must have a Delete permission level less than or equal to that of
the page (or image).  Individual database element modifications have the
same properties.

Let's assume that there exists an account in the system for a user named
"superman" with a password of "souper" who has the highest permissions
(0,0,0).  Superman can point his browser to the login script (currently
http://24.16.72.254/demo/index.cgi) and specify "superman" and "souper"
as his Username and Password respectively in order to login to the
system.  If an incorrect password was supplied, an error message is
returned and the account name (in this case "superman") is written to a
logfile containing failed login attempts with timestamps.  If any user
supplies 3 errant passwords within a single hour, their account is
automatically locked for a 24 hour period.  Each account has an
associated hint field.  If a user has forgotten their password, they can
check the box trailing "Show hint?" and the Login will return with their
hint (this will not count as a failed login attempt either).

After "superman" has logged in, he will be presented with a field for
specifying search criteria to limit the protected pages to be listed.
The default value of "*" requests all files.  Currently, there are only
a handful of protected pages or images so it is not overwhelming to
request all files but as the system is used more widely, far too many
pages will be stored to show to superman everytime he examines the file
list.  If too many pages are found, superman's browser may crash since
the resulting page could scroll down for thousands of pages and overrun
his free system resources.  Therefore, it makes sense to specify pattern
matching criteria to determine which pages should be listed.  If a list
of only those files stored in the image directory was desired, superman
could replace "*" with "/img/*" to show every file that has a PageName
beginning with "/img/" (and is therefore stored in the server's image
directory).  Superman could specify multiple stars ("*") if he wanted a
more complex search.  Each star will match zero (0) or more characters
of any kind.

Having specified a search criteria of "*.htm*" to show a listing of all
available HTML files and clicking "List Protected Pages", superman is
shown a page containing a link at the top which goes back to the login
page and a welcome message relating the validation of the newly
allocated session code and the designated permission levels associated
with his account (in this case: Read=0, Insert=0, Delete=0).  Below
those is displayed a table containing options for each of the files
whose PageName matched his search criteria.  Each of these HTML pages
can be read, edited, or deleted.  Clicking the button to read any
particular page will render the page dynamically within a frame which
describes what the entire page would look like if it were being viewed
directly through dp.cgi.  The edit option will enable superman to modify
the PageName, permission levels, or contents of any file.  The delete
option removes the file (right now, this is permanent, but I'm
considering a trashcan scheme to make deletion less drastic).

Below the matched pages table is a small table which can be used to
create new files (for webpages or images or anything which can be stored
as a file).  A PageName can be specified and a new empty file will be
created or superman could select a local file (from his own computer) to
upload to the server as the initial contents of the new file.  This
operation will fail if the file already exists in the file system or the
database.  If it exists in the database, it must first be deleted by a
qualified user before a new file of the same name can be created.  If
the name is not in the database but is only found in the file system, an
administrator of the server will have to remove the file (for security
reasons) before it can be created.

The table following contains user administration options.  Superman
could use the fields in the first row to create a new user in the system
with initial values for their username, password, hint, permission
levels, and session time limit.  The next row can be used to update any
user accout.  New values can be provided to reset a user's forgotten
password, reassign their hint or permission levels, specify another time
limit, or lock/unlock the account.  The drop-down selection in the
Username field describes each username, permission levels, time limit,
and locked status (U or L) all separated by colons (:).  The last row
can be used to select a user to remove permanently from the system.

The following button labeled "Change Group Settings" goes to a page
which contains all of the defined group settings.  This page can be used
to create, modify, or delete group definitions.  When users login, each
group is checked in order (top-down).  The first group that contains a
range which the user's permission levels fit into is the group that the
user is affiliated with (even if later groups also match).  If a
DefaultPage is specified for a user group, the protected page with the
same PageName is displayed with dp.cgi after a login instead of the file
list and administration options.  Any number of groups can be created
(limited by disk space) each with their own respective DefaultPage to
which matching users will be ushered.  The check boxes apply to users
who match groups that don't have DefaultPages (because they have enough
access to see the file list and other administrative features).  Each
box limits which components are displayed to logged in members of that
group.

The button below that labeled "Change Your Settings" goes to a screen
for updating personal account settings.  This can be used to change your
password, hint, time limit, or search string.  For superman to change
his password, he'll have to supply his old one and then repeat the new
one correctly (and it must be at least 4 characters) for the update to
succeed.

The last button is simply to "Logout".

The above describes the administrative features of the 800Telephone
system (as of June 28th).  Below, I will describe the methods which can
be used to embed database requests within html pages in order to produce
secure dynamic pages.  The system also has the ability to process
embedded database insertions and updates from dynamic pages.  These
contents can be added to html files though the page edit option from the
administrative list or directly on a workstation before being uploaded
when a new PageName is created.

There are currently two different ways to specify a database field to be
dynamically inserted into html each time the page is accessed.  The
first method is just a minimized cryptic code for describing any field
while the second is just a more verbose method.  Functionally, the two
are equivalent.  In html, the first would look like:
    <h3>Some Field is: {id=1~Customer_Record.Type}</h3>
where "id" is the name of the primary field and "1" is the primary value
of the known record containing the desired field.  "Customer_Record" is
the name of the table that contains the field names "id" and "Type".
"Type" is the desired field that gets replaced into the html (if
permissions allow).  An equivalent html line to the above with the
second syntax method is:
    <h3>Some Field is: 
{PrimaryField{id}=PrimaryValue{1}~Database{demobase}.Table{Customer_Record}.DesiredField{Type}}</h3>
This second method must have each value enclosed in braces {} after the
field name.  The field names are: PrimaryField, PrimaryValue, Database,
Table, and DesiredField.  The Database field can be omitted for any
normal query since the default value is the main 800Telephone database
already (just as it was absent from the first example above but could be
provided there also as another value preceeding the table name separated
by a period).

There are several operations which can be embedded within dynamic pages
to update, modify, or delete data elements or records as well.  Any
number of these operations can be performed with a single submission.
Examples for each follow.

There may be several issues missing from the above description however,
it is my hope that an html/graphics designer could take this file, along
with a description of relevant database names and fields and a
description of what inputs and outputs are necessary or desired for each
particular page; I imagine that these three would be sufficient to fully
develop nearly all of the pages necessary for 800Telephone.

The method for updating data is relatively complex but it is a necessity
of the inherent power involved in performing multiple secure database
updates with each web form submission.  The main processes available are
insertions, updates, and deletions.  To insert, the logged in user must
have sufficient insert permissions.  Sufficient delete permissions are
required for deletes.  The user must have both delete and insert
permissions beyond the specified level for the data elements being
modified to perform an updating operation.  Any number of operations can
be performed within a single form submission and each one is validated
on an individual basis.

Each suboperation is encoded with operation numbers in each name field.
Listed here is an example of a simple insertion:
    <form action="dp.cgi" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="wich0bas" value="demobase">
    <input type="hidden" name="wich0tbl" value="Customer_Record">
    Which Field?: <input type="text" name="wch0fld0" value="Type"><br>
    What Value?:  <input type="text" name="wut0val0" value=""><br>
    Which Field?: <input type="text" name="wch0fld1" value="Reason"><br>
    What Value?:  <input type="text" name="wut0val1" value=""><br>
    <input type="hidden" name="wut0todo" value="insereco">
    <input type="hidden" name="pagename" value="customer0.htm">
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Create New Record"></form>
The (currently) available values for the hidden field "wut$Xtodo" (where
$X = the operation number, 0 in this case) are "insereco", "updtfiel",
and "delereco".  Operation numbers begin at 0 (zero) and proceed
sequentially (in decimal notation) upwards unbounded.  One submission
button could perform any number of inserts, updates, and deletes as long
as each is encoded sequentially according to the operation number.  To
perform any insert, the following fields are required:

  * "pagename" is a required field for every submitted form to tell
        which dynamic page to load after the submission is processed.
        (NOTE: When only pagename is specified, it's just like a normal
           link to the new dynamic page without any database changes.)
  * "wich$Xbas" must contain the name of the database into which data
        will be inserted.
  * "wich$Xtbl" is the table to receive the inserted data.
  * "wut$Xtodo" must contain "insereco" for an insertion.
  * "wut$Xfld$Y" is the name of the field you wish to provide an initial
        value for where the integer $Y ascends from 0 to the number of
        fields you wish to insert into the new record.
  * "wut$Xval$Y" is the corresponding value to insert into the specified
        database and table and field.  (NOTE: Any number of field and
        value pairs can be specified up to the total number of fields
        specified within the table.  Each value will be given a default
        if no entry for the field is designated.)

To perform an update, the following fields are required:

  * "pagename" to specify which page to load after the update is
        performed.
  * "wich$Xbas" must contain the name of the database from which data
        will be updated.
  * "wich$Xtbl" is the table to receive the data update.
  * "wut$Xtodo" must contain "updtfiel" for an update.
  * "nown$Xfld" is the name of the field (most likely the name of the
        primary key) which identifies the record you wish to update.
  * "nown$Xval" is the value of the field which is a unique
        identification value for the record you wish to update.
  * "wut$Xfld$Y" is the name of the field you wish to provide a new
        value for where the integer $Y ascends from 0 to the number of
        fields you wish to insert into the new record.
  * "wut$Xval$Y" is the corresponding value to update in the specified
        database and table and field.  (NOTE: Any number of field and
        value pairs can be specified up to the total number of fields
        specified within the table.  Each value will be retain it's
        original value if no entry for the field is specified.)

To perform a delete, the following fields are required:

  * "pagename" to specify which page to load after the update is
        performed.
  * "wich$Xbas" must contain the name of the database from which the
        data record will be removed.
  * "wich$Xtbl" is the table to delete the data from.
  * "wut$Xtodo" must contain "delereco" for an update.
  * "nown$Xfld" is the name of the field (most likely the name of the
        primary key) which identifies the record you wish to delete.
  * "nown$Xval" is the value of the field which is a unique
        identification value for the record you wish to delete.

Following is an exceptionally simple example of an insert, update and
delete all in a single form:
    <form action="dp.cgi" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="wich0bas" value="demobase">
    <input type="hidden" name="wich0tbl" value="Customer_Record">
    Which Field?: <input type="text" name="wch0fld0" value="Type"><br>
    What Value?:  <input type="text" name="wut0val0" value=""><br>
    Which Field?: <input type="text" name="wch0fld1" 
value="RelationshipXq"><br>
    What Value?:  <input type="text" name="wut0val1" value=""><br>
    Which Field?: <input type="text" name="wch0fld2" value="Reason"><br>
    What Value?:  <input type="text" name="wut0val2" value=""><br>
    <input type="hidden" name="wut0todo" value="insereco">
    <input type="hidden" name="wich1bas" value="demobase">
    <input type="hidden" name="wich1tbl" value="Customer_Record">
    Known Field?: <input type="text" name="nown1fld" value="id"><br>
    Known Value?: <input type="text" name="nown1val" value="3"><br>
    Which Field?: <input type="text" name="wch1fld0" value="Type"><br>
    What Value?:  <input type="text" name="wut1val0" value=""><br>
    Which Field?: <input type="text" name="wch1fld1" 
value="RelationshipXq"><br>
    What Value?:  <input type="text" name="wut1val1" value=""><br>
    Which Field?: <input type="text" name="wch1fld2" value="Reason"><br>
    What Value?:  <input type="text" name="wut1val2" value=""><br>
    <input type="hidden" name="wut1todo" value="updtfiel">
    <input type="hidden" name="wich2bas" value="demobase">
    <input type="hidden" name="wich2tbl" value="Customer_Record">
    Known Primary Field?: <input type="text" name="nown2fld" value="id"><br>
    Which Unique Value?:  <input type="text" name="nown2val" value="5"><br>
    <input type="hidden" name="wut2todo" value="delereco">
    <input type="hidden" name="pagename" value="customer0.htm">
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Return to Primary Customer 
Page With A Record Creation, Update, & Delete all at once!">
    </form>

Hopefully the above description is clear enough to describe the method
of my madness... I mean my genius =)  If you have questions, feel free
to pay me to answer them.  The remaining operation is a way to perform
selections (searches) on the database in order to arrange comparisons
and statistical evaluations generated from large portions of data.  I
will update this description once selections are operational and can be
described.  TTFN.

-Pip

I downloaded the flash and it runs on my box fine.  I'll put it on the 
server shortly.  I did call you this afternoon and left a message.  I had to 
run to the leasing office a couple hours ago but I've been home otherwise.  
All the options on the mailer script will be finished tonight.  It seems 
that the persistent cookies code I have only stores correctly in Netscape so 
I'm looking into making it more portable.  TTFN.

No.  SSI are only good for tiny dynamic elements like counters.  Did you

I've looked at the Linux and JavaScript versions and neither one looks 
useful to me.  The Linux one is a client application for X-windows (Gnome) 
relying on PostgreSQL and the JavaScript is for a Windows box with SQL 7.  
Neither are anywhere close to our server environment which is not currently 
running a single one of these client windowing systems or databases.  To do 
something like this, you'd need to get another computer setup as a 
workstation... The data could be exported from the server to the workstation 
whenever accounting needed to be done.  Will you buy another computer to use 
for such purposes?

Browser Express is a web email system for clients.  It has web interfaces 
and code for POP3 and SMTP.  It would probably be quite difficult to 
automatically generate emails from Perl scripts by using Browser Express 
since it's made for clients on the web.  You can buy it if you'd like.  We 
could use it to provide customers with webmail services.  It is not likely 
to solve the sendmail frustrations I'm dealing with.  Thanks for trying.

July 6

I've been pouring over the code and ... well here is my analysis:
  I could change the submission structure to handle each field update on a 
single line.  The deletion of a record could also be distilled to a single 
line.  Inserting a new record would not be as easy to handle on a single 
line as the other two.  Insertions would probably have to remain similar to 
the current structure.
  To make these changes, I would have to throw out a lot of code and rewrite 
it since fundamental assumptions of the updating structure permeate both the 
entire password module and the dynamic pages script.
  I could probably finish rewriting and testing the modules by next Monday 
or Tuesday if it were necessary to do so.

  The system works as it is now (even if it is slightly more complex than it 
could have been).
  Redesigning and rewriting such fundamental components introduces 
significant opportunity for things to break  that are already working 
correctly.
  I don't think it's worth the time to rewrite so much Perl code just for 
the perceived benefit of more compacted (and more redundant) single-lined 
html code.

That's what I've found.  Hopefully we can discuss what more to do tomorrow 
afternoon.  TTFN.

-Pip

Makes a lot of sense.  I don't think their accounting package will suit our 
needs then.  Hopefully we can find or construct something else that will 
suffice.  Shalom.

My analysis was based upon how much code would need to be thrown out and 
entirely rewritten and how much other code would be able to be modified in 
place.  The total of the two is overwhelmingly large.  It can be done.  It's 
a lot of work.  I hope it wouldn't take until next Tuesday to get it right 
but it could.  Do you want me to do it?

-Pip

p.s. I've downloaded all of Anita's test directory from Dynamic.net.

That looks really cool!  I love the shark!  I'm glad you found a new job... 
I wish I could get out from under Len (and payed somehow too).  I grew up in 
North Hollywood (off Coldwater & Sherman Way).
  Len asks me every couple days if I've talked to you or heard from you or 
called you.  He's paranoid and doesn't want us to talk or something.  He's 
usually just a jirk.  My contract with him is largely dependent on his 
hiring a web designer to make the pages and interfaces.  He's never been 
able to keep anybody.  He's never thought I've finished everything I could 
or should have so he doesn't pay me any more than my rent when it's due.  
There's not much left I can do without a web designer unless I try to do the 
layouts and gfx myself but I'm sure I wouldn't get payed to do that either 
and it would take me forever and I'm really dismayed.  He's auditing my 
documentation and asking me to rewrite huge sections of the code that 
already werk perfectly just because he thinks his idea makes it simpler.  He 
also wanted me to take my technical documentation and dumb it down so that 
any business man could understand completely how to use the system.  I told 
him no.  He got furious and said (once again) that I never want to help him 
do anything and he's always trying to help me and that I don't work hard and 
I don't ever lift a finger.  He's cooking up crap to distract me right now 
because I don't really have anything left to do unless I rewrite everything 
or start a full blown accounting software package from scratch as he's also 
suggesting is part of what I need to complete.
  I need some steady income... and hopefully I can find employment with 
somebody who isn't so crazy.  Anyway, I hope your new job is wonderful to 
you.  Sorry about getting Len all upset on you by telling him that we had 
emailed a couple times or something.  Hope to talk to you soon.  TTFN.

-Pip

Hey Len.
  I've called a couple of times since 3pm and just got your answering 
machine so I figured I'd just reply to your email.  The DNS server that 
services my subdomain was busted a good part of last night and this morning 
so I couldn't test any code changes until now (it actually broke again while 
I was composing this mail so I can't send it yet).  I read portions of the 
contract exhibits again and I realized that I really need a digital copy of 
them so that I can search for certain things that I've read but can't quite 
remember where to locate.  Could you please save them as text or html and 
attach them in an email to me so that I can search them from my computer?  
Thanks.
  If you're available, let's meet on Sunday or Monday afternoon to determine 
my priorities for next week.  I'll be addressing whatever issues I can and 
fleshing my design for the statistics and vendor components in the mean 
time.  Also, I'm nearly broke and my car insurance payment is due.  Can I 
get payed another $500 at our next meeting?  Thank you.  Have a good 
weekend.

-Pip

Hey Len.
  Can you send me the contract in text format please?  Additionally, can you 
save the other documents you sent  me into text format and resend them?  
Thanks.

Hello Nita.

I think Len is a lost cause.  I must say I'm immeasurably thankful for your 
willingness to help me.  I'm afraid that anyone doing html for Len is going 
to have to be closely supervised (and consequently yelled at regularly) by 
Len himself as he must micromanage everything his tentacles can reach.  He's 
payed me less than half of the agreed amount for the whole project even 
though I've finished over 85% of my obligations.  He wants me to rewrite 
huge sections of code (that already werk correctly).  He wants me to 
document everything so that a moronic non-technical business man could fully 
comprehend everything... a glossary and less technical language here and a 
more lengthy example there, change this, change that, etc..  He wants me to 
write full blown statistics and accounting packages from scratch.  If he 
could've been nice enough to keep any designer around long enough to get 
some substantial werk done, there would be a much more convincing system in 
place.  I'm looking for other werk and coding on my own fun projects now.  
I'm not really paying him much mind but I sure wish there was some way to 
appease him and get payed a little more before he and I part ways (if we 
haven't already).  Well I'm probably gonna go read for a while or play some 
games.  I hope your new job is going very well.  Talk to you soon.  Shalom.

-Pip

p.s. This is what he just sent me on Friday...

Hey Nita.
  It's okay to vent about Len... I may need to also =).  I've spent many 
hours today trying to archive all of the emails over the past 3 months (and 
there are a ton) in case he drags me to court.  I can't help but wonder if I 
could counter-sue since he hasn't payed me even half of the agreed amount.  
He also hasn't been able to hang on to anyone to get interfaces done which 
are requisite to the last parts of the project.  I think I'm going to ignore 
him because I'm just gonna get into a heated argument (pointlessly) and 
probably end up insulting his DNA if we try to talk about anything.  That 
guy sure makes me mad.  I just wanted to make money and do a good job.  I 
sure tried hard but I'm through getting underpaid for his benefit.
  My brother is doing quite well.  It looks like he's gonna be heading back 
to Cali this weekend so I'll probably hang out with him for a few days.  I'm 
looking forward to seeing him all well soon.  Thanks for asking.  How is 
everything with you?  Your new job going well?  I've gotta find one too... 
hopefully soon.  =)  Take care.  TTFN.

-Pip
