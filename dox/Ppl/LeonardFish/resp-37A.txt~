Re: Mr. Fish vs. Stuart

  ATTN: Lisa Profera
  Three copies of this letter have been printed.  Two have been sent to 
you.  Please forward one to the arbitrator && keep the other for the 
AAA's records.  The third copy has been sent directly to the claimant 
(Mr. Fish).

  I know an additional response wasn't asked for but I feel it's quite 
necessary to address Mr. Fish's latest submissions.  He has imagined or 
lied about many things but most of them don't seem to be relevant so 
I will try to be brief because I was really hoping that I could already 
be done with the all the explanations.  I just could not permit Mr. 
Fish's latest falsehoods to go unchallenged.
  1) Regarding the claimed entirely useless && inaccessible code:
    a. All of it resides on his server's harddrive, his personal 
        workstation's harddrive, && his lawyer's harddrive (presumably 
        since I emailed the documented archive to him repeatedly).
    b. Mr. Fish chose the `root` password for the server himself.  After
        doing so, he told me what it was so that I could utilize it for
        development.  I never changed it.  I memorized it then.  I don't
        happen to remember it any longer (nor where I might have it 
        written).  This password is not even necessary to access any of 
        the code I developed.
    c. Mr. Fish still should have his own personal account on the server 
        (which he also chose all the pertinant information for).  His 
        personal account is sufficient to read, copy, && modify all the 
        code on his server.
    d. Since he has the server's hard drive in his direct possession, he 
        can easily utilize any normal Linux boot-disk (like the one that 
        came with his RedHat distribution) && directly access the entire 
        harddrive volume.  Every boot-disk I have ever used has had a 
        "rescue" option for such a purpose.
     It is a bold-faced lie to say that I have somehow witheld the code 
      from Mr. Fish.  It is very accessible to him && it always has been.
  2) Regarding the speculation about my earnings && my purported 
      dishonesty:
    a. I had never done contract work before I met Mr. Fish.
    b. I did not simultaneously work on other contracts while I worked on
        800Telephone (though it shouldn't have been illegal if I had done
        so).
    c. I have not been paid for consulting or contract-work since I dealt 
        with Mr. Fish.  I was not an experienced mature professional 
        contract programmer as he likes to claim.
    d. I have not updated my Guru profile since I left TelcoBid.com.  I 
        plan to do so once this arbitration is concluded.
    e. I did unintentionally misrepresent the duration of my "independent"
        status since I have worked indepedently since I stopped attending 
        the University of California at Irvine.
    f. Other than while working for Mr. Fish, I have enjoyed stable 
        employment through salaried positions everywhere I have worked 
        (except for a special agreement with my close relative's company 
        [BCI Group] where I was paid $3k each month for almost 3 months 
        for completing 3 substantial tasks).
    g. I was paid a 50k / year salary as of last week when MindFire && I 
        mutually agreed that I was no longer useful towards the new 
        direction they have decided to persue.  I did not quit && I was 
        not fired.  I left on very good terms && may well return should 
        they decide to develop new products in the future.
    h. I am prepared to open up all of my bank records.  I have nothing 
        to hide.  I have not intentionally falsified anything.  I also 
        have not fabricated anything for this arbitration process.
    i. As I stated before, I do not have any savings nor do I own anything 
        of great value (ie. worth more than $5k).  I normally have less 
        than $1500 in my checking account as the extent of my financial 
        resources.
    j. I have not been able to afford a lawyer at all.
    k. I did not exhaustively review the original contract.  I also did 
        not "demand" that contract without any modifications as written 
        for another programmer.
    l. I did not choose OpenMerchant.
    m. I have been unable to afford the arbitration expenses.  My debt && 
        lifestyle are expensive.  I have also just landed a new job which 
        pays 40k / year so my financial situation is not likely to be much 
        better than it has been.  
    n. I have been busy since I stopped working on 800Telephone to pay for 
        my expenses.  I have not intended to "ignore the legal process".  
        I have responded as promptly && directly as I am able (without 
        legal assistance).
  3) I did provide documentation (both to Mr. Fish && his lawyer) for the 
      software I wrote.
  4) Mr. Fish bought me two books (not ten) which I have not returned 
      (but am willing to).
  5) Mr. Fish did not buy my cable modem or pay for my access bills or 
      ever absorb any of the hardware expenses I was forced to endure 
      when I experienced a catastrophic harddisk controller failure 
      which incapacitated my development machine.
        
  I know it all boils down to his word versus mine && I feel I may be at 
a great disadvantage since Mr. Fish has lied so consistently.  He has 
quoted me out of context whenever it has suited him.  Many other 
falsehoods were presented by Mr. Fish that hardly seem worth arguing.  
Hopefully it is apparent that my "assets and earning power" are not as 
voluminous as Mr. Fish had hoped && they have not been lied about.  I 
have been as direct && honest as I could be.  I have not tried to hide 
anything.  If there is any information that can help us to be done with 
this once && for all, I am willing to produce any records I have.  I 
have done this as well as I could from the outset.  That's why this all 
seems so pointless to me.  It should also be apparent that I've never 
dealt with this sort of business before && that I don't have money 
bags to hand over because of some imagined damage I mysteriously caused.  
I have not sabotaged any of Mr. Fish's hardware or software.  If I have 
told other people about how he has treated me, it was only because I did 
not want to see other people manipulated && abused as I was.  I 
certainly earned at least the $5k I was paid.  I should not be held 
responsible for Mr. Fish's office or Business Plans or Accountants or 
server hardware or new programming expenses.  None of them have hinged 
on me or if they have, it is Mr. Fish's fault, not mine.
  Something else that seems particularly relevant is the projected 
expense of hiring "a new group to start from scratch in an expedited time 
frame", "new programmers", && "a new programming staff" that Mr. Fish has 
referred to as the most expensive damage I have caused.  This valuation of
the associated cost of development of the system Mr. Fish is asking for has 
yielded an average quotation of $75k.  Clearly multiple teams of 
programmers have been contacted since this project was (&& is) no small 
task.  To expect that a single early-twenties programmer could simply 
accomplish this same task for less than 1/7th of the average quoted price 
as calculated by experienced professional contracting firms (presumably) 
in an equivalent timeframe is obviously unreasonable && heartily bolsters 
my argument that I could not have possibly met Mr. Fish's expectations.
  I'm not even sure what is happening anymore.  I think I have 
demonstrated that I was incapable of completing the contract as written.  
This was visible sometime between the first && third weeks of this twelve-
week effort.  Clearly, I was still being paid for months after this 
"breach" && the situation only got worse as Mr. Fish && I both seem to 
attest to.  Our initial agreement must have deteriorated quickly.  I 
contend that we fundamentally altered the original agreement when we 
verbally agreed to not utilize OpenMerchant (since I couldn't get it 
to work).  Apparently Mr. Fish argues that I didn't even come close to 
fulfilling the first (or any following) week's deliverables according to 
the contract.  Either way, I couldn't complete even the beginnings of the 
contract on time (since it was all based on OpenMerchant && I couldn't get 
it running).  The time necessary for software development (of any 
kind) routinely exceeds even the most careful && experienced projections.  
I was not experienced but was as careful as I could be under the 
financial pressures I was facing.  It's all pretty simple.  I worked as 
hard as I could to be paid as much as I could until I was unable to 
afford even my basic living expenses.  I could not depend upon my 
roommates to cover my share of our bills for very long since they are all 
students who work part-time if at all.  I had to find a normal job where 
I would be able to survive.  Mr. Fish && I agreed to change our original 
agreement (which I was incapable of adequately performing) during that 
third week.  I did not have a better option than to try to rewrite 
OpenMerchant's core functionality myself since I could not benefit from 
the system as it was then (even if others were able to utilize it).  I 
would have continued to work on 800Telephone if Mr. Fish would have 
ongoingly paid me reasonably (ie. slightly more than my living expenses).  
Since he did not, I was unable to continue developing software for him.  
Now I don't like him anymore && don't want to deal with him ever again.  
That's it.  I'm convinced that he is crazy && cruel.  Please let me know 
if there's any more information or clarification I could provide that 
would be helpful in further evaluating this case.  Thank you.

p.s. I'm not sure how the hazy issue of Point-to-Point (P2P) intellectual
property (as it pertains to the Napster case) is actually precedent or 
even germain in the context of the present case but it might be 
interesting if it indeed is since it seems to be cited incessantly.  
Maybe it's an analogy suggesting that Old/obsolete/abusive versus 
Young/clever/defiant-when-mistreated is an ongoing battle where the farts 
are presently winning because they have endless resources for litigation 
but they will someday be overrun by their own unadaptability to the 
changes in technology && the world.  I could see that.

p.p.s. I do happen to enjoy playing video games.  I also enjoy software 
development.  I do each quite a bit.  Hopefully neither is sufficient 
proof of criminal or amoral underpinnings as to require a conviction in 
any disputable matter.  It seems Mr. Fish assumes that I don't take 
anything seriously because I like to play.  He is a fool.  I'd bet he 
was a lot cooler back when he invented silly string.  Now he's just a 
sue-happy intellectual propertly worshipper.  TTFN.
