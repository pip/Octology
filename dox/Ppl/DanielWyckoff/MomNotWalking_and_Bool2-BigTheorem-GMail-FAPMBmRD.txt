Hi Danny,

I'm terribly saddened to hear that your mom is still doing poorly and is not able to walk. I want for her to have a strong recovery and normal health back. I'm glad you're able to visit her each day. I hope she can return home soon to recuperate further.

I'm also sad for you that you have to worry about shelter and food for yourself in the future. I wish I could do something to reassure you that you'll be well taken care of and not have to fret about your basic needs being met.

I'm glad you're keeping busy doing good work for the Great Spirit. Thank you for further encouragement on my Octology too. I can't do much with all the high doses of additional medications they have me on right now. I'm starting to struggle with reading and concentration again (but it's not quite as bad as in 2010 so far). Your work on Bool2 sounds very complex and challenging. I hope your "big theorem" and Version 0.2 can be completed and released to your satisfaction and gratification after you've had enough time to devote yourself to them. Glad you're balancing your smoking and getting stoned to just the right amount too. I wish we could take time together to relax and smoke someday soon. =)

Love,
- Pip
