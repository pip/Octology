I claim that both P is true and ~P is true.
This is because everything is true.
How do I know that everything is true?
Because I never saw a false statement.
This is disturbing because the statement "The most disastrous thing imaginable
is happening now" is true.  And the negation of that statement is true too.
We need to explore the concept of senses.  In what sense is P true?  In what
sense is ~P true?
What am I trying to accomplish by writing this?  To convince others that 
everything is true.
A mathematician would object on the basis that we're only speaking in irrelevant senses.  They would demand that we would explain in what sense everything is true.
A better question now would be how do we explore the structure of Truth?
Because even though anything and its opposite is true, it's always beneficial 
to explore in what sense the foregoing is true.
Some "basic" operations can have more complex redefinitions. Banach-Tarski.  
1 = 2.
When do we need to redefine number?  When we have paradoxes which can't be 
resolved.

Prime statement: Something is unresolved.
