What's up with DJ?
Who knows you've asked us to crash? (FoloUp:Do they know "here"?)
Any probz or drama you might be towing along? (We need to know about such stuff right now, if even remotely likely.)
Is a safe place to sleep the only thing you're in dire need of right now? We might be able to come pick you up in a bit, etc..
... ?
What's your plan for tomorrow on? (Maybe shouldn't be discussed until she's here... but maybe good if she's needy on phone.)
