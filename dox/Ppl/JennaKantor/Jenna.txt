Speech class monologue for Tue. 10-26-99

oh you are sick of self love Malvolio
and taste with a distempered appetite.
to be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition
is to take those things for bird bolts that you deem cannon bullets:

there is no slander in an allowed fool,
though he do nothing but rail;
nor no railing is known for a discreet man,
though he do nothing but reproove.
