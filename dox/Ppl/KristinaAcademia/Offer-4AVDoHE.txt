Hi Kristina                                                      4AVDoHE

  There's a few things I'd like to address.  First of all, I did get a
bit drunk at our BackBone Hallow's Eve party.  I also pressed upon you
again that I am extremely interested in you romantically && attracted
to you physically.  I don't want you to see it as mere lust.  Each time
I have approached you, you have gracefully && carefully related that you
don't know what you want && you need time && space (the continuum).  I
wish to give those to you.  I desire vastly more than sex so I hope the
fact that I was overwhelmed by your costume is not misconstrued as
just the basest of cravings.  I can explain why it impacted me
profoundly in myriad ways that are not lustful but that would be time-
consuming && likely overwhelming to you in new ways.  We may revisit the
topic should you ever wish to... I just hope you don't chalk this all up
to drunken lust because I am not that mundane.

  My sister && I discussed my increasing infatuation with you today.
She encouraged me to explain why I am good for you, why I think I
deserve someone as wonderful as you.  Oh, I can write or speak at
length about how amazing you already are to me as well but I hope you
already know how great you are... so your greatness can be revisited at
need as well.  I would not tire of espousing why I am already
overwhelmed by your elegance && poise.  So what are my qualifications?
Why should you consider me as a worthy candidate for closer friendship,
companionship, maybe romance?  I can't answer with knowledge or
understanding of which traits are most important to you yet... but I
will explain why I love myself, which of my characteristics seem most
excellent to me, && why I think I should qualify to court you.

  I am honest.  I strive to tell the truth as simply as I can... which
admittedly, is often a monstrous challenge because the truth isn't
always simple.  I believe that honesty is the cornerstone of every
worthwhile relationship.  I trust myself && others until it seems I
shouldn't.  Without this foundation, I don't believe love or loyalty or
any number of other crucial traits can be soundly established.

  I love... deeply.  I love myself.  I don't mean I dream of gazing at
myself in the mirror but I am happy with almost every part of myself
inside && out.  Those parts of me that are less than I would like them
to be, I either constantly work to improve or I have come to terms with
them && accept that they are facets of myself that I can be content
with even if I don't try to change them.  I love other people similarly.
I love my family && friends.  I share my heart with them.  They, just as
I, have strengths && shortcomings.  I love them.  I love who they were,
who they are, who they're becoming, && who they will be.  This is a very
important trait to me... the capacity && willingness to love... even
when you know without doubt that it hurts a lot to do so.

  I am sensitive.  In the extreme, it is seen as passion, melodrama,
zeal, fervor, zanshin, fire... but I feel deeply too.  I am no statue.
I can be moved.  I can be touched by little or big things.  I can cry.
I feel... extreme joy && sadness.  I feel for others.  I am as
considerate as I can be.  I care about others && don't mean to
unnecessarily hurt or even discomfort.  This can become confused though
because I deem certain agitation necessary && beneficial.  Sometimes I
see people as stagnant && complacent && unhappy... which prompts me to
discomfort them... to try to explain or argue why I think improvement is
available.  This can be seen as insensitivity but it is overriding
concern for the broader condition.  So I am sensitive to little && big
things with myself && others.

  I am intelligent.  I think critically.  I consider both immediate
conditions && circumstances as well as the abstract && existential
ramifications.  I have powerful reasoning facilities, a broad
vocabulary, a desire to be expressive, effusive even, && an intention
to continue learning as long as I breathe.  The desire to learn is the
key to intelligence && ultimately wisdom.  Given enough time, I suspect
the will to learn is the only component needed to ultimately arrive at
truth... although life is limited enough that other faculties must be
employed on a more practical level as well.  Learning is difficult... it
is a constant challenge.  It is scary && humbling to admit you don't
know, don't understand, && may never be able to fully comprehend
something.  Those are requisites to meaningful discovery, enlightenment,
&& achievement.  An intelligent person is better equipped to make good
decisions, improve their own condition && the world, && probably also,
materialistically, to provide for the sustenance (&& toys) of their
family && friends (although idealism sometimes clouds this ability).

  I am ambitious.  I regularly bite off more than I can chew but it is
because I know that I have done so before && overcome.  The more I deal
with && achieve things that seem out of my grasp, the farther I can
reach next time.  I strive to do things... I always have many thoughts
&& ideas && side projects.  I aim to accomplish great things && even if
I miss the mark or fail at many of them, I keep trying.  Maybe my goals
aren't typical but they are still extremely important to me && I don't
let go of them lightly.

  I am creative.  I enjoy creating both abstract && tangible things,
solving hard problems && appreciating other peoples' ambitions &&
creations && artisitic expressions.  I revere craftsmanship && quality.

  I am loyal.  I am no betrayer.  I have never cheated on a girlfriend
&& I never intend to (even though I have been cheated on).  It would
take a ridiculously contrived && grave situation of life && death
before I would consider engaging in any sexual act with anyone other
than the woman that I love.  I have been committed to a girl && seduced
by another on several occassions && have fled each situation && kept my
integrity.  I know this trait is extremely rare && I hope a lot to
think I still might find it in a partner as it remains in me but... what
can I say?  I still do hold that hope.

  I am playful.  I enjoy challenge, discourse, puzzles, competition,
struggles, precision, cooperation, strategy, reflexes, humor,
camaraderie, etc..  I enjoy both studying the core components of games,
realizing their execution, && participating in the compelling
experiences they provide.  I have an excitable && playful nature in
almost everything I do.  I believe this is very valuable as it tempers
the severity && harshness of life with the multifarious beauty && joy
that surrounds all that we are && do.  It is a celebration in the face
of death.  I believe dancing && singing are particularly refined forms
of play && I enjoy participating in them when the time feels right.

  I am in love with you.  I want you with all my heart && hope that
this means something to you too... but other traits should be more
important so I'm trying hard to stop falling back on this one.  I crave
you... but this can be quite scary to a traditionally beautiful woman
as you... when so many people are crazed && lustful && dangerous.  I
don't want to be associated with those things in any negative sense...
so I try to stifle my overflowing emotion in an effort to pace things
more appropriately... to not scare you by the tumult of my turbulent
mind.  Yet I also hope that yours is similar && that we can harmonize.
I think you have been afraid && cautious because it's tough && lonely
out there in the world... the whole survival thing is wearying.  I hold
hope that you are like me... that we may belong together in a pure &&
true way.  Is that the case?  You've had a bit of space && time
separating us to contemplate what you want.  I understand that you may
need a great deal more.  I want you to have whatever you need.  It is
not passing lust for me.  I will wait indefinitely to find out whether
you will permit me to approach you.  Just as I hope, you will discover
your innermost desires with certainty, I also hope the result of that
introspection will be an invitation for me to become as close to you as
you are comfortable with && that you evaluate me as a worthy suitor
should you conclude that you're ready to pursue a serious (heh... yet
still playful) relationship.

your twitterpated samurai friend,
-Pip
