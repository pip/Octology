Hello Kristina,                                                  4B4MB1P

  I know... I know you're not interested in me like I am you.  I want to
write about that.  I guess these writings are mostly just for me to help
me get through the sadness of falling so hard for you && having nothing
in response from you.  I didn't really have any appetite since the
weekend... until today.  I was pretty depressed yesterday && went to
gaze over the bay && choke down some bread && beer... && it started
hailing.  I want you.  I still want you badly but... I don't want to
make you uncomfortable so all I can do is keep liking you from the
shadows like this && hope that you'll notice... which is unlikely since
we hardly see each other.  Now I'm kinda whining.  Boohoo... woe is me.
I want a chance to get to know you... a chance to get closer together
but it is one-sided && so I lose.

  What do I want to chat about?  Yeah I got drunk at the party && yeah
I went crazy over your costume... but it's because fighting game girls
are my fantasy... && not just sexually.  I mean those girls epitomize
all of the components of femininity that I want to get near.  Those
girls are strong && disciplined && graceful && loyal && smart && sexy.
I've already seen you as those but then wearing a Chun outfit... I
mean she's the archetype of fighting girls... it made me just want you
more than my mind could handle.  I still have aftershocks where I can't
stop seeing you && thinking about you even when other stuff is going on.
I'm wrecked.

  So you don't want to go out with me.  You've told me the two main
reasons are you don't like going out with people from work && you don't
know what you want.  So for the first one, yeah we happen to work for
the same parent company but in different buildings on different projects
&& we go weeks without seeing each other.  I'd say the degree to which
we "work together" is a matter of perspective.  So the second point,
you don't know what you want.  At face value, you may really be unsure
about everything... but there's probably more to read into... like you
are in a less-than-ideal relationship... maybe even a rotten one... in
which case, you're pretty sure you don't want that long-term but you
can't seem to get out of it either so any interest in me or thought of
something else is considered cautiously && dismissed as bleh I dunno.
Maybe you were in a relationship recently && you're recovering so still
shaken && unsure whether to trust again.  That would make sense.  My
mind keeps falling on another possibility which is you are not
attracted to me at all && can't imagine ever being... so you claim you
don't know what you want but you're just trying to nicely say no thanks.
I think && hope you wouldn't be roundabout like that... that you could
just say you're not interested in me directly but... maybe you're wary
of my reaction.  I guess I am too so I can't blame you.

  What can I do?  Is there something I could say or do to get your
attention?  ... to get you to want to spend time with me?  This has
been a very tough week for me... my emotions have been totally up &&
down.  Now I've lost almost all hope that you'll say anything to me
or that you've even thought about me at all.  I'm a good guy.

... hmm I've had lots of reasons && explanations but... what would
be effective?  How can I reach you?

You seem to be responsive when I do... like not offended or repulsed...
just cautious.  So... let me work on addressing your concerns...

Let me start over...


Dear Kristina,

  I would like to relate some of my thoughts to you.  As you are aware,
I have become increasingly infatuated with you.  This came to a head
last weekend when I was drunk && you were Chun Li.  It wasn't just
sexual desire that overcame me... but my whole fantastic outlook on
reality.  I see fighting game girls as idealized embodiments of every
great female trait.  Chun is the archetype of fighting girls who exhibit
strength, courage, discipline, honor, compassion, loyalty, grace,
beauty, power, confidence, etc. so I don't see them as just sex kittens.
I see all those characteristics && more && I revere them.  I've notice
those traits in women that I'm attracted to && you evidence many... so
when you appeared in your guise... I was floored.  If we were in a
fighting game, you perfected me.  I've been on an emotional roller-
coaster since then because you cemented my opinion so thoroughly, that I
want you && nobody else.  I want to be near you... I want to get
closer... && I think I deserve to... if you would give me a chance.  So
why do I deserve such a chance?

  Well first, you've said you don't want to date someone from work.  I
certainly don't feel the same way if that means I'd rule you out... but
how much to we really work together?  We happen to be paid by the same
company but we work several suites apart on totally different projects
&& hardly ever see each other.  I don't feel like we work together.
Maybe your complaint is more of a privacy issue though... like you don't
want people at work to know too much about you or gossip or something.
Maybe you've had bad experiences with the like before.  Well if this is
the case, I can work to not mention you or discuss anything you wouldn't
want known with anyone we work with.  That would be difficult for me
since I don't naturally have such a need to distinguish personal && work
but I am more than glad to do my best to develop && maintain such a
distinction if it would allow us to get closer.  I don't want to make
you uncomfortable or put pressure on you to do something you don't want
but I do want a chance to prove that I'd be good to you && for you.

  So let's assume that we either agree we don't practically work
together or we establish that if we get to know each other && get
closer, that I don't discuss any of that with anyone I work with unless
I have your permission.  Then you've said you don't know what you want.
Your friendster profile says you're looking for a guy who knows what
he wants while you don't.  I know what I want from life, a woman,
a relationship, a friendship, a job, etc..  I know I want you more all
the time.  You've said you need time to think... presumably about what
you want.  Maybe I don't look like Johnny Depp but I'm not bad looking
either.  So take your time... figure out what you want.  Let me know
when you know.  I'm lonely && sad && heart-sick knowing that I've
fallen so hard for you && you could hardly pay me any mind && be fine
with it.  Why should I deserve any of your attention?

  I'm honest && loving && faithful && kind.  I'm nerdy && creative &&
sensitive && thorough.  I am ambitious && playful.  I want us to get
closer together.  If you have good reasons why we should not including
that you still need time to figure out whether you are even ready to
get closer to someone, please relate that to me.  I want to abide by
your comfort levels but I also can't let go unless you leave me no
hope that I could ever win your heart.  Please consider these things
along with whatever else you were already && contact me as soon as it
feels right to you.  It cannot be too soon for me as I know plenty
more than enough to know that I want more of you.  Thanks for your
time.

-Pip
