Hello Kristina,

  Last night, at our BackBone Hallow's Eve party, you struck me.  I was
overcome... overwhelmed by so many things that may not yet be obvious.
Of course you are && were stunningly beautiful && your costume
resonated with me && my sex drive in a particularly powerful way but it
was not as base as just that.  You are a brilliant, lovely, careful,
amazing woman... && you own that costume.  You chose to buy && wear
that.  Now I very much hope that you still would have done so even if
you knew the impact it would have.  It was awkward && intense &&
uncomfortable && exciting && frustrating && arousing && intoxicating
for me all at once.  I kept trying to remain calm... kept trying not
to stare... or gawk... but I could not be helped.  You accidentally
manifested yourself to me as the perfected physical female embodiment
of all that seems right && just && pure && lovely && powerful &&
magnificent && breath-taking && wonderful && awe-inspiring &&
deserving of appreciation && adoration && respect && love... in the
world... in the cosmos.  The universe proclaimed to me last night,
in no uncertain terms, that you are the princess of my dreams.  You
are who I loved before I knew you... who I was destined for.

  I'm sorry that I made you similarly uncomfortable if that is not what
you want.  You have asked for space && time && I have striven to give
them... but last night I was compelled to get closer to you.  I could
not want to be far from you... I could not want to tear my eyes from
you.  I am smitten.  I explained as well as I was able... that I didn't
know what to do... how to react.  I had been utterly disarmed... I was
ready to take up whatever cause you would have for me.  That cause
finally was to give you more space && time.  I wish they were as
inexhaustible as they appear... but they inflict me with agony.  I have
fallen madly in love with you in the glimpse of an eye.  Now I want to
be together forever.  I want nothing greater.  Which is why I'm able
to stay away as you need... && why it hurts && scares me to do so.  I
have placed my entire heart in your hand && you have told me to leave
your presence that you may have adequate time to consider it.  Is my
heart in your pocket now?  or in a drawer?  Is it already forgotten?
Is it on ice or left on the floor to be stepped upon?  I am at your
mercy now && I hope my trust is not misplaced... but I have no choice.
I cannot pretend I don't feel as I do.  I hope you are still holding my
heart carefully in your hand && remembering that it's there &&
pondering what it means... why it is before you... whether it should
be... && whether you want it.

  I am prepared to love you with all that I am.  I accept whoever you
are.  I love you as you are && as you will be.  I look forward to
helping you achieve your goals && dreams.  I long for us to restore
each other from the weariness of the world && the toils of life.  I
aim to celebrate the joys && weather the sorrows with you.  I want to
encourage you to become greater as you desire.  I want to be beside you
through thick && thin.  As long as you are honest with me, I will never
depart from either your loyal service nor your balanced companionship.
I will see you as my great equal in friendship && love through all
things.  This is my true pledge.  I am available to you && no other.
I long to be as close to you as you want as soon as you want.  My
desire to be near you is no longer limited by time or space.  I am
ready to remain with you permanently && instantly.  I already love you.

Love,
-Pip
