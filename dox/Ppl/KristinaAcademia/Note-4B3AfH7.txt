Hello Kristina,                                                 4B3AfH7

  I have a few things I'd like to relate.  I know I got a bit drunk at
the party last week.  I hope you don't think it was simply intoxicated
sexual desire that made me fawn over you though.  If you do think this,
the quick explanation is that it's a bit complicated... but I see drama
&& fantasy as necessary components of the real world.  I view myself as
a modern passionate samurai warrior.  Fighting game girls epitomize
idealized femininity for me.  They embody strength && courage &&
diligence && discipline && compassion && grace && power && loyalty... &&
of course majestic beauty.  I see you as all of those things in real
life already but then when dressed as Chun Li, the archetype of fighting
girls... my desire for a wonderful real && simultaneously fantastic
woman clarified.  I think about you a lot.  I don't mean to scare you
or press for unwanted contact... but I very much want to get closer to
you if you will let me.  I need you to know it's not just physical lust.

  I know you've patiently && considerately repeated to me that you need
time to figure out what you want.  I sincerely hope that you decide you
wish to become closer with me but in the interim, I'd like to leave you
with a few reasons why I think I deserve your attention.  What do I have
to offer you?

  I am honest.  I strive to simply say what's true.  This is sometimes
horrendously difficult because the truth can be complicated but I do my
best.  I think honesty is the cornerstone of any worthwhile
relationship.  It is the foundation on which other crucial relationship
characteristics (like respect && loyalty) must be built.

  I love.  I love myself... not in a conceited way but rather I am
very happy with myself inside && out.  I recognize the parts of me that
are less than I would prefer && either work to constantly improve them
or accept them as facets of myself that I can be content to leave alone.
I love my family && friends similarly.  I share my heart with them.  I
see they have strengths && shortcomings, just as I do.  I love them &&
accept them.  I believe the capacity && willingness to love is difficult
&& important.  You can only hurt as much as you love... but both are
powerful && amazing parts of life... so I do both with vigor.

  I am passionate.  I feel deep elation && sadness.  I celebrate &&
cry.  I am sensitive in general... with myself && others.  I try to be
considerate of both immediate circumstances && broader ramifications.
Passion && love make me romantic.  I have zanshin. =)

  I am loyal.  I have never cheated... only been cheated on.  I intend
to remain so.  I've been in several trying situations where I was
committed to a girl I loved && had others seduce or proposition me with
engagements that would have compromised my integrity.  I fled each time
&& would do so again.  I hope to find a woman of similar caliber.

  I am geeky.  I think abstractly... existentially.  I long to learn.
I want an unlimited vocabulary so that I can be more expressive &&
colorful.  I enjoy considering difficult problems && their solutions.

  I'm playful && creative && ambitious.  I have myriad qualities to
recommend me.  Please give us a chance to get to know each other more
closely.  I am extremely interested in you because you constantly
evidence the feminine traits that are most excellent to me.  I can go
into greater detail on anything if you wish it.  I hear that you're not
sure what you want right now.  I am sure that I want to get to know you
more.  Please let me know whenever you figure out whether this is
possible.  I will try to be patient but please also don't forget that
I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.  I appreciate your
attention && consideration && kindness.  Thanks for reading.

your interested friend,
-Pip
