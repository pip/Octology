Alexander MATHEWS Jr. Obituary
MATHEWS, Jr., Alexander
Alexander Rhodes Mathews, Jr. ended his 3 year battle with bladder cancer on Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 3:50 p.m.

Born July 27th, 1950 in Lynwood, CA, Al was the 3rd of 6 children and was preceded in death by his parents, Alexander Rhodes Mathews, Sr. and Harriette Jane Power.

Al is survived by his wife of 45 years, Victoria, his 4 children, Michael (wife DJ), Jeromey (wife Melissa), Stacey (husband Stephen) and Alicia, his 7 grandchildren and 1 great-grandchild, as well as his 5 brothers and sisters, their families and the many friends that became family along the way.

Al worked hard all his life to take care of the most important thing to him, his family. The last 22 years were spent at 3M with the most recent years spent in new product development designing things that make the world a better place. In his spare time he was an avid golfer and spent many Saturdays perfecting his swing at the Mr. Tee driving range.

There are no words that can adequately describe this extraordinary man that was both as sturdy as a rock and as soft and tender as a teddy bear.

In accordance with Al's emphatic wishes there will be a celebration to honor his life with food and good company at his home on December 19th, 2015 from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.

In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to First Tee or the Wounded Warrior Project.
