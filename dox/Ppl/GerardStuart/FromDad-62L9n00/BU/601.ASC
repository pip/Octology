Dear Phil,

You're absolutely right.  The Museum homepage is entirely too
long!  And not only that.  Its content is very un-homepagey.

So. As per your directive, I have cut it to 38% of its former
size.  Well.  Actually.  I didn't just <i>cut</i> it -- I
completely re-dood it.

I moved the Duryea Day 2004 Story off into the "Recent News"
department [g] where it belongs/ed, and fashioned a completely
new homepage -- which does what a homepage really oughta -- id
est -- give an overview of the whole site, replete [g] with links
to branch out to the various departments. [g]

I like it far better.  Thank you for making me change it.

What's new on the website since you visited it in late July/early
August ?

         The New Home Page [L2]

         The Recent News // Our Artist [L2] article

         The background graphic in TV Schedule [L2]

         The Duryea Day 2005 Story in Pictures [L6]

This last one, I'm not terribly happy with.  It's not nearly as
good as the 2004 Story.  But DTCBMC, [g] I was not the
photographer at Duryea Day this year -- as I was in '03 and '04. 
But at least the 2005 snapshot [p rw?] is on our site, and I hope
to do much better next year.

Interesting that the Pilot Precise V7 is your fav.  In the mid
'80's, it was mine too.  In fact.  Back then, it was still
possible to buy pens in onesies, but I always bought 'em by the
box (dozen).  The V7 has a .007" tip and is generally considered
a "fine" point -- but not ultra-fine.  I found it to be an
excellent pen and I used it for nearly 10 years.  But when they
changed its exterior, I hated its new appearance.  Originally, it
was an all-ivory barrel, with a little blue dot at the top as a
ink-color identifier.  (They also made red (which I used
occasionally too), black and green.)

It wrote well, felt good, and had a clean look.  But when they
uglied it up, in the late '80's -- with the see-through barrel --
I soured on it, and immediately looked elsewhere for my writing
gear.

Incidentally, my second favorite pen back then (after the Pilot
V7) was also a Pilot of the same general design, but with a .010"
tip.  That one had a light blue barrel.  I believe they've
discontinued that model.  At least, I cannot find it anywhere.

It's somewhat funny that something as mundane [p rw?] as a pen is
of such concern/importance to me -- but then -- maybe not.  I
<b><i>do</i></b> do a lot of writing.

You mentioned weather in your last letter.  This September was
pretty spectacular.  Nearly no rain.  Low humidity.  And no
chilly days.  All 3 of which are unusual for a Pennsylvania
September.

Like they say:

            "There's one thing you can always count on

                   when it comes to the weather

                         -- and that is -- 

                  You can never count on anything

                  when it comes to the weather."

I raced over to my computer to check out the rad pics of you
racing your bike at Thunderhill on Thursday, June 30, 2005. 
Neat.  Thank you so much.  And thanks to Dito too.

I keep checking PIP.LBOX.ORG for the Tuesday, August 16 photos,
but, I no see.  You no gots ?

Did you attend ?  How'd it go ?

Please let me know when you'll be racing in Pennsylvania, and

This is a very [g] overdue reply to your August letter. [g2 see
rough p.6 for text]  Gosh.  I feel compelled to come up with a
good excuse. [g2]  But the simple truth is:  I'm heavily immersed
in tasks at the Museum -- all of which are website related. 
March will be 3 years since I started there -- and I love it.  I
can only think of one thing that might make it better.  And that
is: if it were in San Luis Obispo. [g3 

where I lived from April 1990 to January 1992; and again for 2
weeks in November of 1999 (when I drove down to [y] to see you).

]

In addition to my ongoing website maintenance and development
stuff, I've bee crafting the biography of Paul Hafer. [g2 our
founder]  I began it 2 years ago, and had hoped to have it posted
on our website by the Summer of 2004.  I figured it would take
maybe 6 months -- a year, tops.  Well.  I've never written a
biography before.  And the project's been a real eye-opener.

Plus -- I guess somewhat different from most biographies -- I
like to take side-trips, to give the reader additional
illumination on the fandy and fauna [g3

fandy & fauna is a poetic term meaning events, people & places,
including to do with things being built, or torn down, or the
like-such -- the comings and goings of people and stuff

] going on around Paul's dance. [g

footsteps, activities, accomplishments, doings, et cetera

]

Anyway.  It's turned into some fairly major research.  And I
(generally) love it.  I say "generally" because I love writing
it, and putting it all together, and getting all the pictures,
and editing them, and all that neat stuff.  But portions of the
research are very tedious, and feel unproductive.  Dating things
is particularly difficult ofttimes -- and I am a stickler [p rw?]
for dates.  I believe it puts a story into a more vivid
perspective when you can elucidate [p rw?] on accurate
sequencing.  And there have been a few times when I have spent 50
or 60 hours of trek [p rw?] just to be able to know whether to
say "before" or "after" in some sentence.

I said it feels "unproductive", but I guess the truth is, Yes --
<b><i>until</i></b> I find the answer.  Then, there's a great
deal of satisfaction.  I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. 
It's much like debugging a program.  There's quite an
exhilarating triumph when arriving at the solution to a very
elusive bug.

So when will Paul's Bio be up 'n' posted ?  Hoo nose.  But I'm
hoping August.  I'll let you know when 'tis.

So much for the preface.  Now we 

return to the thrilling days of yesteryear [g7

I stole that line.  If I recall correctly, it was in the
introduction to the radio program titled "The Lone Ranger." 
Actually, he <i>was not</i> alone.  For he always had 2
associates close by:  Silver, under him; and his faithful
companion, Tonto, beside him.  Yes, Silver was his horse -- as in
"Hi-ho Silver away!"  But in [y year], when The Lone Ranger came
to TV, we could clearly see that Silver wasn't silver at all.  He
was white!  Of course.  If the hero doesn't wear a white hat --
then, he rides a white horse.

This summer, it'll be 2 years that you've been in Rodeo.  A

Oh.  I mentioned above [L in section [y] ] about the new homepage
on the Museum site.  I need to include one caveat. [g caution,
beware]  The Google search of our site doesn't work.  Google
works.  But "of our site" doesn't.  For some reason (which I have
not bee able to nail down), our webpages no longer are showing up
through search engines -- not only on Google -- but also on
others I've checked too.

This is a real noggin-scratcher [p sp?] for me.  We used to show. 
But now we don't.

I've done some pretty extensive lookin' for the answer, but
haven't been able to unfold it yet.

Of course, the question is: "What have we changed in our
website ?"  And the answer is:  Well, a lot.  But I've found 2
suggestions of reasons.

     #1   We have recently incorporated some Javascript to assure
          that if someone finds one of our "maintext" pages in a
          search-engine, and clicks on it, that it will come up
          framed, rather than all by itself -- without our banner
          above it, and nov-bars to the left.

          The Javascript code for this inserts a "?" into the
          URL, and I'm told that this can be a reason for a
          search-engine to skirt that page.

          S.  I found another way to make sure all our pages come
          up framed -- without using the JS code that sticks the
          "?" into the URL.  But.  When I tested it, I found that
          the "?" didn't appear to be the problem.  So.  I went
          on to suggestion:

     #2   It's said that search-engines have trouble crawling
          websites using frames.  I said, "OK, I tend to want to
          believe you -- but we've been using frames since [y
          when, date, mo/yr], and for at least a year after we
          went to frames, the search-engines were listing all our
          pages just fine.  So.  I'm greatly plexilated. [g

cornfused, more more more, noggin-scratchin'

]

About a month ago, I posted a "back door" page on our website
that is totally frameless, and I'm periodically checking to see
if it appears in Google.  So far -- no show.  Could it be taking
Google over a month to refresh their database ?  Or, have I
proved that the problem is definitely <b><i>not</i></b> frames
related ?

Well.  Last week, I went into Google, and registered our website
with them.  I thought that might help.  But so far, I see no
Boyertown Museum coming up on Google.  An' besides.  Back in
2004, we were there, without having registered or anything.

OK.  I'll be patient.  And keep digging.

I'm curious.  Do you take vacations ?  Or do you consider your
motorcycle outings and gaming tournaments your vacations ?

I've bee thinking about vacationing lately.  My last real
vacation was in 1991.  Before that: 1990, 1987, 1986, 1980, and
in the '60's & '70's, quite a few others.  In any case -- it
seems I'm due for one.

Actually, I've been quite around the U.S. [g4] -- but not to the
distant and exotic places beyond.  Where have I been outside of
the United States ?

         Eastern Canada - 1959 [g2 to Niagara Falls, with my
          parents]

         Hong Kong - 1967

         Western Canada - 1986

And that's it, except for Viet Nam -- but that wasn't really a
vacation.

Where have I always wanted to go ?

         Paris - I've never been to anywhere in Europe

         Hawaii - This is probably my #1, even before Paris

Where else ?

         Epcot Center - even though it's not "outtatown"

         Maybe a cruise - but I don't know where

But I think it's time to go somewhere.  What do you think ?
