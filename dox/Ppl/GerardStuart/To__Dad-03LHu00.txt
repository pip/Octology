Dear Dad,
    I'm confused... about several things.  Where's my kitty?  BoweBeaux
has been M.I.A. for 4 days.  Hiro & I are missing him.  In Philip.040
what sort of inventory were you requesting I send?  33GB SCSI, 23GB IDE,
64MB PC100, 128MB PC133, Celeron 300A o/c -> 450 (on a cold day),
Pentium III 450 o/c -> 527, HP SCSI CD-Writer, Cambridge Microworks,
Sims 155 Snowboard, Confused Mind (tm), Long Hair, Bare Chest, Small
Beard, Nice Friends, No Steady Employment (yet)... etc.  Why am I
convinced that I should only date/get involved with/marry a Jewish girl
since I obviously want to live a Jewish life but all the Jewish girls

I persue just want to be friends?  Why do lots of non-Jewish girls
develop crushes on me?  Why did you place the most recent stamp
according to the more traditional orientation?  I've been reading online
news a lot... coding little but I'll probably get back into it soon.
It's time to feast (almost) since Purim is concluding but the banana
bread & journeys sound tasty & fun respectively.  Shalom.

                            I love you.
                              -Pip
