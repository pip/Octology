Dear Dad,

  Thank you for your PIP.302
letter too.  I'm glad the post
office has been reliable && speedy
... sorry I'm not always. =)

  Well part of the reason I've
lagged so long in replying is
that I've wanted to refine
&& document my PT (PakTime or
PipTime) code && make it available
on the CPAN already (the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
at http://www.CPAN.org) but I've
been too busy to finish the
object system I have in mind so
I figured it's time to just
describe it to you as how I
intend it to be once released.

Hmmm... so here's a warning that
a lot of the following details
are nerdy && maybe tedious but
I hope I have made good logical

                                                                P1/9
                                                               3AGHYJL
decisions.  Please feel free to
comment on or question anything or
even skip this section if it gets
too tedious && boring.

ok so basics: I use a base-64
encoding (which I usually refer
to as b64 or expand as basS64
as a little joke because I really
enjoy driving bass beats).  So
my digit set is comprised of
  - traditional decimal digits     0..9 (10)
  - traditional uppercase letters  A..Z (26)
  -             lowercase          a..z (26)
  -                        Period  "."  (1)
  -                    Underscore  "_"  (1)
                                    --------
                                    sum (64)
Normal time fields (except the Year)
wouldn't have opportunity to need
indices 62 or 63 but they have
special exceptions too which I'll
explain later.

I chose . && _ to round out my
b64 charset because they are
both natural (ie. don't require
command-line escapes) filename
characters && they allow b64
sentences to be constructed using

                                                                P2/9
                                                               3AGHlEW
_ as a space && . as a sentence
terminator.  Such sentences could
be used to hide codes or
messages in mundane-looking text.

So, as I said, most fields wouldn't
normally utilize their available
64-char spectrum so I didn't
want to waste space (bits) if
not necessary so field mapping
breaks down as follows:
  0) the Year field is normally added
    to 2000.
  1) each 12 added to the Month
    field adds 64 to the base Year.
  2) 24 added to the Hour field
    adds 320 to the base Year.
  3) 31 added to the Day field
    makes the Year negative from 2000.

With these rules, valid 4(or more)-
character PipTimes can represent
any hour which has occurred or
will occur between 1361 C.E. && 
2639 C.E..  The common case
of the upcoming future is in the
simplest to decipher span of
2000-2063 but additional
centuries are possible now.

                                                                P3/9
                                                               3AGI1cZ
I've made some other big changes.
The normal (ie. default) representation
of a PT includes 7 characters
for Year, Month, Day, hour, minute, second,
                                      frame
where a frame is 1/60th of a second.
The assumed timezone is PST (16).

I've added 3 new optional fields
to the object structure.  A
Century field can now precede
the Year field.  If Century is
present, the Century + Year
fulcrum becomes 1 B.C.E. instead
of 2000 C.E. which allows all of
recorded human history to be
encompassed if needed.

Two new fields have been appended
to the bass7 now too.  After
the frame field can come Jink.
A Jink would normally be 1/60th of-a-frame
The plural of jink is jinx.  I chose
the name "jink" for many reasons but
the main ones are:
  0) I like the sound (like "hijinx")
  1) abbreviation is unique from other fields
  2) combination of "jiffy" && "blink" which
    both mean very fast.
Normally a jink would be about 0.3 milliseconds.

                                                                P4/9
                                                               3AGIFiq
I say normally because the objects
contain member functions which
facilitate redefinition of the
ratios governing the relationship
between seconds && frames && jinx.

The 10th (index [9]) && final field
is Zone.  Zone is the numerical
hour offset from GMT.

Whenever individual fields can
be colored (as in all my shell
prompts or my realtime PT clock)
they should be colored as:
  Century    Dark Red
  Year       Red
  Month      Orange
  Day        Yellow
  hour       Green
  minute     Cyan
  second     Blue
  frame      Purple
  jink       Dark Purple
  Zone       Gray or White

to help isolate fields' representations.
                            as a distinct field
I don't include Day-Of-Week ^ since it is a
simple function of Year, Month, && Day.

                                                                P5/9
                                                               3AGISIC
So I already have my utility handling
most of these developments fine && 
can convert to or from different
representations.  So the birthdays
you sent convert as follows:
  Dad      0 h88KU  # the line you wrote
   Sun. Aug.  8 20:30 1943 -> v8dKU
  Mom      6 q5H??  # the line you wrote
   Sat. May  17  ?:?  1952 -> m5m
  Philip   1 -CD6X
   Mon. Dec. 13  6:33 1976 -> OCi6X
  Angela   4 -610f
   Thu. Jun.  1  0:41 1978 -> M6W0f
  Timothy  2 -9U62
   Tue. Sep. 30  6:02 1980 -> K9z62

I'll ask Mom what time she was born
when I remember.  So we're:
  D v8dKU
  M m5m
  P OCi6X
  A M6W0f
  T K9z62

So what do you think of PipTime?
The rainbow colors make it pretty
too.  I've got objects to store
durations of time too using the
same fields so you can add "2 weeks"
to some PT object with an overloaded

                                                                P6/9
                                                               3AGItwN
"+" operator.  You're so right
that code is never done. =)
I'm happy with PT... just need
more time to work on it.

So as you have gathered, ambiguity
arises with 1, l, I, i && 0, O, oso
I try to employ fonts which
distinguish them.

Sirlin && I have had no luck getting
GameOver off the ground so far.
Loan officers && Landlords have
not seen promise in our business
aspirations && plans to reach
profit.  I've had to return to
In-N-Out Burger to make ends
meet.  Friends && food are great
there but pay is poverty.
Sirlin is living off savings so he
is still plugging away on
loans && locations for GO.  I
hope we can open soon or I
find some better income to tide
me over.

                                                                P7/9

How are Ange && Tim?

They're both well.  Ange is
still in Wisconsin working hard,
loving herself, her fam && her cat.
She's supposed to visit me
in Cali sometime soon.  She might
move back here in a year or two.
We chat on the phone every couple
days.  I miss her so && can't
wait to give a big hug.

Tim dropped out of college to
focus on business.  He ran
a mildly successful limo service
for a while, wanted to move
into the restaurant business,...
but then decided to become
a stock broker for the challenge
since he was bored && felt
stagnant.  He's up in the San
Fran Bay Area right now for
some training.  I was hoping
to get dinner with him tonight
but it's starting to get late.
I asked for Saturday off so he
&& I could chill together though.
I think there's a kickboxing tournament
he wants to go to... should be cool.

                                                                P8/9
                                                               3AGJFUD

Glad to hear of your Museum
work && study.  Sounds fun.

I'm sorry I don't remember
Animatch but I'm glad a new
incarnation lives on.  I'd like
to see it again someday if
possible.  It's sweet.

Hmmm... The Ruggery sounds like
a rough endeavor even if sales
would have been better.  10
hours of work + material costs
sold for $30-40 doesn't sound
lucrative enough.  I've done
something similar.  I've built
8 arcade fighting sticks &&
sold 2 for $100 each.  Parts
cost me about $40 && each took
about 8 hours to make.  Inside,
they're basically cracked-open
Sony PlayStation controllers wired
up to real arcade replacement
parts.  Fun to play with.

                                                                P9/9
                                                               3AGJP7H
I'd like to make && sell more
when I have time.  We'll see.
It's sure not profitable enough
to do as more than a side
hobby for me.  I don't have
very good tools for the wood
either.  I'd like to see or
have one of your rugs if you've
kept them.  Do you play
video games?

heh  Thanks for the help.

Well I'm gonna drop this in the
mail && try to find Tim.
