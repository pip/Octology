Dear Pip,

                  ------------ 0 ------------ Pts36CL6

  Summer came today (*1) -- and with it, your letter.  I must admit.
  I can't think of a better Father's Day gift.  Thank you <ul>so</ul> much.

  San Bruno, huh ?  That's camping on the edge of the runway.  Neat.

  What happened with San Rafael ?  And betwixt there & San Bru ?  You say,
  "have had to move many times recently."  Tell me the story please.

  By the way.  Thank you for your writing.  No, I don't just mean the act
  of writing, but what you said.  I <ul>have</ul> been many of the adjectives you
  used as you vented onto your paper.  And, just so you are confirmed in
  something you already know, I say it straight out in the next paragraph.
  There are few persons on the planet that know this, but obviously you do
  -- and that's good.

  It is <ul>not</ul>disrespectful to your father to tell him that you are angry
  with him, or with how he acts toward you, or things he says, or the way
  he says them.

  It is one of a son's assignments in life to "train" his first 2
  ancestors through the process of transformation, from beparenting, to
  befriending.  (You are so perfect, and on track.  And I love you.)

  Be <font size="-1">a little</font> patient with me.  I shall learn your lessons.  As you keep
  teachin', I'll keep learnin'.

 *1  by weather, not by official date

 We are very in the pattern.  In 1980, we were friends.  In 1984, we were
 <ul>very</ul> good friends.  And then there was a dip (which is normal).  And now
 the son has said to -- even pleaded with -- his father, "Can you
 please be my friend ?"  And the answer is, "Yes.  With your guidance."

 I'm new at this.  And you are my firstborn.  So, we'll give it a go.
 And learn it together.

 Interesting that you should be getting into motorcycles just now.  Over
 the past month I have been doing some research in that field.
 Faskinating stuff.

   I had a ride on (the back of) a motorcycle once in my life.  And.
   I <ul>well</ul> remember it.  I was about 19.  Maybe 20.  A fellow in the
   area asked me one afternoon if I'd like to go for a ride.  I
   hesitated for a moment, and he readd me like a book.  He could see
   that I wanted to say "yes", but was irresolute because of his
   reputation.  And then he added, "an easy ride."  I nodded and 
   smiled to indicate that I understood him, and immediately accepted
   his offer.  You see.  Floyd Knapp was called "Crazy Floyd" around
   town for the way he handled his "bike."  But that was only when 
   riding solo -- not with a passenger in tow.

   It <ul>was</ul> an "easy" ride.  But also, truly fun.

   And from that day to this.  My attitude about motorcycles has 
   been:  Wow.  I love 'em.  But only as a passenger.  For, with my
   proclivities (I never do anything half w;; it's always 110% or
   nothing) I'd soon become Crazy Gerry at the helm of a Suzuki, or
   more probably, Dead Gerry.

               Did You Know (*2)

 When you see a black & white movie with a motorcycle in it, 9 out of 9 1/2
 times, it's an Indian.  In the 1950's, BSA (of England) was the top 
 producing manufacturer in the world.  And today it is Japan (as a 
 country) and Honda (as a brand).  But in the early '20's (b&w movie
 daze), the (American made) Indian was the world's mega-maker.

 When you come visit next time, maybe we can go see where they make
 Harleys.  The plant is only an hour's drive, and they have tours, but
 I've never been ...
