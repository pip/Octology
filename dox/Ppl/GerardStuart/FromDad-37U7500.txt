Dear Philip,

                  ------------ 0 ------------

  Thank you for your letter of 37O.  I received it at 37TFq.  Not bad for
  having just mailed it on 37Q.  The post office has been reasonably
  consistent of late in doing coast-to-coast in 3 days.  (T-Q=3)  Not
  always, but frequently.

                  ------------ 1 ------------

  Birthdays ?

    Dad            0 h88Ku
    Mom            6 q5H??
    Philip         1 -CD6X
    Angela         4 -610f
    Timothy        2 -9U62

  I don't remember what time of day Mom was born.  It seems I did know,
  but can't recall.  And the years for you, Ange, & Tim don't yield to
  paktime, because, 76, 78, and 80 are beyond the "z" value of 61.  Se la
  vie.

  The (nearly) superscripts preceding the paktimes are Day-Of-Week.

  (I say "nearly" because the relic Panasonic KX-P2023 dot-matrix printer
  that I'm using will do a full height superscript (which looks 
  <fullsuper>really</fullsuper> weird) or a half-height one (which doesn't always go high enough to
  fully qualify as a <super>super</super> script).  See what I mean.  So anyway, I prefer
  the latter -- usually.

  Also.  For help in deciphering Angie's Birthday Paktime:

      0    on the P2023 is a zero
      O    is an upper-case letter "O"

  Sounds like you've got it all under control.  I'm glad you are gone from
  Big Ape.  And joining David.  What is your role going to entail ?

                  ------------ 3 ------------ [typ:Pts381Ea]

  What's going on with Angie & Tim ?

                  ------------ 4 ------------ [typ:Pts381Ed]

  What have I been doing ?  Reading ?  Etcetera.  I've just recently
  apondered such.  I haven't been involved with a commercial operation
  since August of '91.  Everything beyond that has been with non-profit
  orgs.  A college, a YMCA, a "church", a community-access TV station, and
  now a museum.

  It's funny how things connect, and how old stuff recycles into your
  life.  But with new wrinkles.  I was working at a TV station when Tim
  was born.  And then in July of 2001, I started running camera for BCTV
  (Berks Community TeleVision), every Tuesday night for about 2 years.
  (Just volunteer - no dinero - I hate that green stuff.)  And one evening
  in March (2003), the host on the "Museum" program mentioned that they
  were looking for volunteers.  I approached him after the show, and asked
  what they needed.  [wri:Pts37U89 typ:Pts381El]  Among other things, they
  were seeking a "computerguy."  We had a match.

                  ------------ 5 ------------ [typ:Pts381Ep]

  And speaking of match -- do you remember in 1982, I wrote a little
  computer program for my children, called "ANIMATCH."  I think back to
  those days, and how much we did with how little.  That computer had a
  total memory of 4K !!   And 0 (zero) drives  --  not even a floppy.  The
  program was loaded from a cassette tape, and there was no monitor.  We
  used the TV for a video display.

  Anyway, the Museum wanted a computerized matching program.  I did not
  have the 1982 code anymore, but in 1992, I had re-written Animatch with
  scores of categories for the college where I was then tutoring.  I dug
  out my source sheets and realized that though the general structure
  would be similar, a more-or-less start-from-scratch would be best.  I
  began in March (2003), and, though not done,  [wri:Pts37U85 typ:Pts381Ex]
  (is a program ever really finished ??), it was very usable, and had 74
  categories, by mid-June.

  You asked what I've been reading.  Well, about 2 or 300 books on
  transportation:  autos, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, trains, planes,
  wagons, horses, and on and on.  No, I'm not an expert  --  but I've
  picked up a tidbit or three.  Interesting.  <!-- paragraph symbol -->  As you've probably
  guessed, the Museum is "... of Historic Vehicles."

                  ------------ 6 ------------ [typ:Pts381F6]

  Hmmm.  I said I was not involved in a profit-making endeavor for the
  past 12 years.  And that's true, but in early September of '97, almost.
  I went into a partnership to form a tiny "¨company?" called The Ruggery.
  We purchased an old loom for hand-weaving small throw rugs.  The deal
  was:  I would make 'em; my partner would sell them.  In a month, I had
  produced about a dozen and a half rugs.  (Around 10 hours per.)  And we
  planned to sell them at about 30 to 40 dollars each.  By October 4th, he
  had sold 1, and we dissolved the partnership.

  Oh.  This may be of some help on page 2, et al:
        (but not much, just as with the 0 (zero) and O (cap-letter "O"),
        the difference is <sub>miniscule</sub>.)

        1    on the P2023 is a one
        l    is a pyg "L"  (y'know: "caps & pygs")
