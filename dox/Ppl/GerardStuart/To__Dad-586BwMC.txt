 Happy Birthday Dad!

  I usually think I know what's
going on and even when I don't,
I'm cool with it.  Similarly, I may
not know what you think I should
know about "the Times" but I'm cool
with that for now too.

Thanks for your letter.  It is great.
I appreciate hearing about your
influential uncles and the history
of pens.  It doesn't seem too easy
to locate discontinued Paper Mate
Contour pens.  If I found one,
I'd be glad to send it to you.
I've had pens that I prefer change
for what I thought to be the
worse but each time, I've quickly
found a happy alternative.  My
                            586CU22
current fav is the Pilot Precise
V7.  I usually just type but I
still like to write with ink on
occassion.
  The weather here is good and
hot.  Awesome for motorcycling.  If
you'd like to check out some
rad pictures of me racing my bike
from just over a month ago, hit:

and follow the ThunderHill link at
the bottom.  It was totally a
fun time and we're planning to
return in a week and a half.
I also just started a cool new
job and am about to go to
Evolution to compete in and help
run our annual International
Fighting Game Championships.

I'm mostly happy and healthy.
Things are good here.  I'm glad
you seem well too.
  I have loaded your website.
I like it.  It's mostly good and
well-organized but maybe the
Home Page's main frame scrolls
down too far and should be
split into further pages.
  Again, I hope you enjoy a
most happy birthday.
  I love you Dad!
