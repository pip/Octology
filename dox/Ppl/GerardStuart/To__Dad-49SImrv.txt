Hi Dad,
  I've been super busy at
work lately... still there now.
I've been having fun playing
the latest good video game
releases when not at work.
I hope you're well.  Other
than being so busy, I'd like
to start writing each other.
hee hee... I've moved once again.
Hopefully I can stay put for a
year this time.  New address:
  Pip Stuart         also
  124 Bonita Ct.  PipStuart@Gmail.Com
  Rodeo, CA 94572 if you ever want to
                   e-mail.
         I love you Dad.
                  -Pip
p.s. Did you get the birthday card I sent?
