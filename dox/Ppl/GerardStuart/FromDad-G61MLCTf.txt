Hi Sonner,

At first, I was going to answer your question
"How are things with you ?"  ─  by saying:

                 Everything is good.

But then I was reminded of Mom's sermon
on Sunday, March 23, 2014, in Ephraim  ─
and believe I shall instead say:  All is well.

         Is there a difference ?  Possibly not a
         whole lot  ─  but different words tend
          to paint somewhat different pictures. 

     Sometimes, saying something again
  ─  but, the subsequent time, differently:
     brings the message home, where it
        failed to do so, the time before.

  So.   That's my answer to your question.

      The short answer.   If you wish more:
 say so  ─  and I'll be happy to give you
 an extended version.   Or  ...

      Ask specific questions.   As you wish.

And then:  I have a question for you.   And,
I would prefer the extended version of
your answer.   The question is:

          How are things with you ?

                   Ya see.   I have this problem.
    Not only do I love you.   I also (muchly)
             miss you.   I remember our times
                            in Tarzana, and before.

        And I miss them.   We chatted openly.
 And warmly.   And deeply.   And I felt close
to you.   And.   I believed, and believe, that
we had not only a father-son relationship 
─  but also quite a friendship.

   Do I still feel that ?   Do you ?   Of course,
I can't answer the second one  ─  but on the
         first one, yes I can  ─  and, no I don't.

         Do I long for that friendship to return ?
I do.

       Do I know how to help it to come back ?
I do not.

             I'm open to ideas.   That is.
                    If you want it too.

 H'ever.   Whether we ever reconstitute what
we once had, or not  ─  I love you more every
 day.   And I see gooder days coming for you.

    All is well  ─  and it shall get weller too.
