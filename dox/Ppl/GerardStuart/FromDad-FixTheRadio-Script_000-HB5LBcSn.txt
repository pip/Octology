0)    James Allen   1902


1)  The aphorism, "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he." -- not only

  embraces the whole of a man's being, but is so comprehensive as to reach

  out to every condition and circumstance of his life.


2)  A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum

  of all his thoughts.


3)  As the plant springs from, and could not be without, the seed, so every

  aspect of a man springs from the hidden seeds of thought, and could not

  have appeared without them.   This applies equally to those acts called

  "spontaneous" and "unpremeditated" as to those which are deliberately

  executed.


4)  Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits;

  thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own

  husbandry.


5)  Man is made or unmade by himself; in the armory of thoughts he forges

  the weapons by which he destroys himself.    He also fashions the tools

  with which he builds for himself heavenly mansions of joy and strength

  and peace.    By the right choice and true application of thought, man

  ascends to the Divine Perfection; by the abuse and wrong application

  of thought, he descends below the level of the beast.    Between these

  two extremes are all the grades of character, and man is their maker and

  master.


6)  Of all the beautiful truths pertaining to the soul which have been

  restored and brought to light in this age, none is more gladdening or

  more fruitful of divine promise and confidence than this -- that man is

  the master of thought, the moulder of character, and maker and shaper of

  condition, environment, and destiny.
