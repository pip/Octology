Dear Dad,

  Thanks for the great reply.  I'm
glad it met you for a good Father's
Day.  So, when is your birthday?

  Hmmm... the story of my moves...
I was working on the Mtv Celebrity
Deathmatch video game for a while
in San Raf but had a falling out
with the jerky owner && got fired.
Wound up back at In-N-Out Burger
after not finding a new game-coding
job for months && going broke.  Moved
into a bad living situation with a 
girl I worked with @INO.  She
kinda fell for me but I didn't
want a romantic relationship with

                                                                P1/3
                                                               37OI0i7
my roommate && coworker... I
was kind && protective of her in my
role but she wanted sex && turned
bitter after I slept near her too
long without doing her.  She made
home && work quickly unhospitable so
I tried to reason with her a bit
before I moved in with another INO
friend.  I begged for my old BigApe
Celebrity Deathmatch job back && was
rehired on some restrictive conditions.
New roommate, Mike, was a cool INO
manager (still is) && all into video games too so
it was a much better living situation.
I moved again from Novato to San Bru
with Mike.  We're doing well here.
                                                                P2/3
                                                               37OI9fE
I quit BigApe when jerky boss
stopped paying everyone.  Place was
horribly managed.  Did a little
contract programming the past 3 
months for an airline regulations data
company.  Just completed && got that
approved this week.  Now working
to open a new video game business
with friend, David Sirlin (www.Sirlin.net).
Hoping to stay put for a while.  Got
lots of fun side Free Software coding
projects... riding my motorcycle...
practicing a little for the upcoming
Evolution 2003 Internation Fighting Game Championships
coming up next month.  Hangin' out
having fun. =)

                                                               37OIHPm
  I'm really happy we may be kindling
a healthy friendship.  Please let me
know what you're up to in your
reply... like catching up
through what you've been up to too.
What work have you been doing?  What
have you been playing?  Reading?
Pondering?  How have you been
changing / growing / learning?  Also
feel free to ask about my
exploits.  I'm totally looking
forward to visiting you && us enjoying
the Harley tour together.  I may
not be able to put the time && money together
for it this year but I hope it can happen soon.
I love you Dad!           Love,
                              -Philip
