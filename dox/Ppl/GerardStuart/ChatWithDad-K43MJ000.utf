How was your week My Lord ?
üòä
I'm not sure. Weird. How about yours?
Speck-tack-you-lar !!
Tell me about your "weird" please.
Uhm, I don't know where to begin really either.
It's ok.
Just breathe.
I can w8.
üòä
Well I'm stricken by the number of deaths COVID-19 has caused.
Ok.
I'll have a question on that later.
But -- you are typing.
I'm worried it's on quite a war-path.
Go on please.
Worry is usually directed. 
What is your "at" or "about" ?
I don't know.
Worried about you -- getting it ?
I probably will at some point. Maybe converging from remote vantages.
Why ?
Do you want it ?
Probably not (unless I learned more about it being more survivable && good), but exposure to it seems to be nearly inevitable at some point. We'll see.
A question.
Puedo ?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
üòä
I ‚ù§ you Pip.
üòä I ‚ù§ you too Dad.
Are you following ...

The 6-point Plan ?
Good.
Probably a good plan. It seems so.
You do realize that following
that plan reduces your chances
of contracting the C-19 by
heaps & mounds --
don't you ?
Yes, but it sure seems aggressive.
Don't talk that way about    it.
I'm thinking ...
did you want me to
launch into my lesson
on "worry" ?
Well -- duyah, kid ?
Sorry. Don't know yet more appropriate ways.
You can. Maybe I need to hear it. I'm worried too many people are dying before ventil8ors can be provided to save their breathing.
I'm going to save the "Worry'll Kill Ya" lesson
for now.
And take a different tack.
Ok ?
Ok.
Good.
Thank you.
You have your 29 Pieces handy ?
Not exactly. I was caught up by other things.
Let me get them.
Ok.
Take your time.
I'll w8.
Got them.
Xcellent.  I've got mine too.
üòä
You're welcome for the "Thank you." just before querying for the 29.
You're phunny.
You make me smile.
I'd like to point you to
3 Pieces.  And I'd then like
to have you make no comments
on them.  And then I'd like to
ask you some questions.
All that sound ok ?
Yes.
Good.
10 Q
U R wLcome.
lol
Piece #1
Piece #5b
Piece #29
And now --
the first Q:
Did you say "thank you"
for the C-19 coming to us ?
Thank you for the C-19 coming to us.
Xcellent Pip.
Could you recite #5b ?
If yes -- please do.
There are no accidents in your universe.
Xcellent.
Now -- you know what is coming.
Here is the 3rd question.
And -- of course -- it is
Thank you for everything. All gifts. Gr!
based on #29.
Gr8!
Q follows:
Why       is it good ?
It's unclear to me why it is good so far.
Good answer.
May I tell you a little story ?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you for offering.
I shall.
üòä
You're wL-come.
Story follows.
Stuff happens.
And not all of it --
seems good.
We wonder about that.
I     wonder about that.
I say to myself:
"Why would a God -- who is
supposed to be so good --
and loving -- allow all
this garbage to descend
upon the children He
supposedly loves ?"
Well.  I asked myself that.
And "myself" could not
answer it.
So -- I decided to --
ask Him.
I said:  Father --
Right. Thank you.
why do you throw such
storms of garbage at
your cherished kids ?
He said:
"Pick one Gerry."
I said:  Oh.  A specific ?
He said:  Yes.  A specific.
I said:  Ok.
I've got one.
Divorce.
Where is the "gift" in that ?
He said:  Good one Gerry.
Lotsa people wonder about that.
But very few bother to
ask me about its giftiness.
The Bible suggests:
1 marriage.
And -- if it doesn't "take"
-- you don't get a "redo".
Seems pretty harsh of me.
Yes ?
Yes.
Yes.
But -- I'm not a dumb guy.
Lookit the sky.
Pretty nice.
Pretty organized.
I'm pretty smart.
I do great work.
So.   Couldn
Whoops.
So.  Couldn't I be
pretty smart in the
"only 1 marriage per customer"
department too ?
Don't answer that.
I am.
I am smart there too.
Thank you. You could be smart in every department && lots of not.
Imagine this.
A person gets married.
Expects it to last a lifetime.
It's a good marriage.
Great even.
But it ends before the person's
lifetime expires.
The person does not follow
the most common path --
which is:  to try again.
This is not only the norm.
It is what most "holy men"
sanction, endorse, and are
fully willing to stand "up-in-front"
and perform "all over again".
And -- in spite of the fact that
they have readd my book.
It's not that they don't "get it".
It's that they can't "sell it".
So they cave in -- and do
remarriage after remarriage
after remarriage -- and
on and on.
Well.
Enough on them.
Thank you.
Let's get back to
that "person" which we were
talking about.
Was married.
Great marriage.
But -- it ended.
The person did not get
remarried.
Because -- the book
suggested:  not to.
Now.  What did the person
do with his yen to enjoy
the blisses of marriage ?
He looked elsewhere
for that kind of relationship.
And then -- my Father said
to me:
Do you understand it now Gerry.
How divorce is a gift.
That is -- if -- you stay that way.
And don't remarry.
So.
I thunk it over.
And -- for years --
I didn't "get it".
And then -- finally --
I did.
And that was about 25
years ago (or so).
And then -- a few weeks
back -- I went to Him again.
And I said:
"Father -- this covid-19 thing.
I know it's a gift.
I know that from Piece 29.
And from Piece 5b.
But I don't quite see its
giftiness yet.
Could you give me
your glasses please ?"
And He said:
You already have them Gerry.
I gave them to you 25 years ago.
Same gift.
Same glasses will see it.
Ok Pip.
Would you like to finish
this story ?
Or...
You have a question ?
I don't have a good perspective on divorce or marriage.
Read back over this story.
The "person" was not some
hypothetical.
Your Dad was talking about
your Dad.
Yes. Thank you.
I don't know how to finish the story.
Your Dad had the most blissful
and blessed marriage in the
history of all time.  His wife was
the most spectacular wife any
man could ever wish for, hope
for, or ever desire.  He was
"over-the-moon" with joy --
and living on the mountaintops
every day of his life.
And then -- God said:
"You're welcome Gerry.
And now -- I'm going
to turn the page."
Are you starting to see it Pip ?
Yes. Page turns are gifts to be thankful for.
Ok.
Let me help a bit.
God (supposedly) loved
His favorite kids.
His "chosen people".
The Israelites.
But.
He put them through mess
after mess after mess
after mess.
Why ?  Because he planned
to bring them to the mountaintops.
Why has He dealt thus
with Gerry also ?
More mountaintops.
Higher even than the ones
back in Gerry's "marriage" days.
And not for Gerry only.
He wants to take many others
of His children to those same
lofty ranges.
But -- the "don't remarry" thing
is not being followed.
And when the Israelites did
not follow one commandment --
He gifted them into a brand new
situation -- far harsher than
the previous one.  And He
did that over and over again
with "His favorite kids".
Are you getting an idea here ?
Are you seeing the link
Somewhat.
between remarriage and C-19 ?
Each brand new situation is another gift with continuity.
Yes.
But it's all for the same end.
Father wants to give us something great.
Just as He gave "the promised land"
to The Israelites.
Covid-19 is simply
"Plan B" from God.
Because we (nearly universally)
have rejected Plan A.
Plan A was:
Don't remarry after your divorce.
In the 6-point Plan
which I had put up on the
screen -- which point tells
us where to stay ?
I'm not sure.
Points can be stays or aways?

The word            "stay".
Stay your hand, father. Be not quick or harsh to judge.
Sorry.
I'm (somehow) not being clear here.
Which of the 6 directives
in the chart above --
has the word "stay" in it ?
Sorry. The 5th with "Stay at Home".
Yep
üòä
You've got it.
When divorce happens --
God's suggestion is:
Stay at Home.
Do not go out
looking for a replacement.
But we don't do that.
We go out -- and look
for a new spouse.
God put up with that
for a long time --
and when His longsuffering
of our disobedience came to
its end -- He said to Himself:
Ok.  Maybe the Coronavirus
will get my message across.
(//)
Holy God! His message should get across.
He wants us to Stay at Home.
And do what ?
Learn His messages?
Yes.   Assuredly.
But even more so :::
ask Him questions.
After a divorce --
He wants us to
ask Him questions.
And so.
With the Coronavirus
He wants us to
Stay at Home
and ask Him questions.
I've been a terrible specimen of humanity in my own eyes && in God's then, if he chose to observe.
I should be repentant && change my ways.
Why ?
Because if God can listen && voice a response amidst discussion, then there could be few doubters who could just verify to whatever length.
Go on.
Maybe I should get the challah && attempt a brachah over it?
Sure.
I can w8.
Take your time.
üòä
Ok. Thank you. Sorry to make you w8. Be right back...
Breathe Pip.
I'm not going anywhere.
‚ù§
Thank you. ‚ù§ 
Are you always upstairs of upstairs, in some form or another?
Not sure what you mean by that.
Or your Father in Heaven is, rather?
Help ?
I'm not sure what I meant by it either. Just a sens8ion of proximity, despite distance.
Nevermind that.
ok
Does the Son of God need crosses amidst a throne?
Not me.
I'm a son of man.
I just wonder if crosses are more a symbol of death than resurrection?
Absolutely.
And they are very new too.
God hates them.
Easter is not about "the Friday before".
It is about "the Sunday after" !!
Well thank God for having a plan.
Does our Father in Heaven have plans for this Pesach?
What do you think ?
Probably, yes.
Ok.
What  ?
A sweet Sader dinner with marror (horseradish bitter-herb) && hard-boiled egg?
Sounds interesting.
Did you have some challah ?
Hopefully not too many plagues. Saders would be better.
Yes, Darjee && I each ate a bit of challah.  üòä 
Sweet.
I miss it.
This past week was nearly breadless.
Do you want to review your calorie && movie budgets?
I do.
But probably later.
Okay.
What are your plans for this coming week ?
Well to try to stock more food && re-learn how to ask God questions, if doing so is fruitful.
How about you?
I don't want to talk about it.
):
üòû
But thank you for asking.
Actually ...
I fully expect this coming week
to be nothing short of:
fabulous !!
Are you planning on
another excursion to Madison ?
Probably not again for quite a while.
Why not ?
Don't those games go every week ?
Yes, but there are better reasons to stay home for now.
Oh yes.
What was I thinking ?!!
Just (slightly) unconscious there
for a moment.
I frequently forget about
the c-19 thing.
lol
Cancel that last question please.
I'll re-ask it again in August.
üòä
Sounds good.  üòä 
Well do you have anything else on your PCA for tonight?
I do.
Is there a chance that we
can continue this tomorrow
evening ?
Yes.
Let's.
Sounds like a plan.
Thank you for this one.
üòä
Thank you as well.  üòä 
I ‚ù§ you Pip.
You're welcome.
I ‚ù§ you Dad.
You and Darjee have a good snooze.
You too.
Thank you.  I will.
And we'll redo on Sat Apr 4 2020
at 2000 G / 1900 P ?
Yep.
Ah yes.
April 4th.
Another anniversary.
56 years.
Well -- goodnight then My Lord.
üòä
GoodNight Dad.

How has your Sabbath wrapped up dear Dad?
Goood Evening Philip.
Good Evening.
How was your Saturday ?
üòä
It ain't "wrapped up" yet.
I get to chat with Pip
-- before it wraps !!
I ‚ù§ you Philip.
It was mostly gr8, but I've been more pensive than usual, contempl8ing the existence of G-d, the ramific8ions, how to seek to know Him more earnestly, whether it might be adversarial or better to be allies, whether servant is better than slave... a lot of weird stuff to mastic8.
I ‚ù§ you too Dad.
Xcellent !    Xcellent !!     Xcellent !!!  
Pensive is good.
Contempl8ing is good.
Mastic8ing is good.
You are good.
No.
Scratch that.
You are grreat !!
üòä
I've also upd8d some Octology code which gener8s 3 differently sized crosses. The first in the upper-right is just the crux showing the section mapping (which you can see a minimal version of under the "Precursor"). Lower-right shows the word blocks fit to my default 160x50 terminals, && the lower-left fits just about all 1400 8-words within a 240x67 terminal. What do you think of any of it?
https://github.com/pip/Octology/raw/master/gfx/sho/Octology-cros-shot_3840x2160-K44MHuBF.png
Hmm.
It's not loading.
Let me try again.
BBS
Hopefully these can be crosses as symbols of life rather than death.
Nope.   
I just get an  x  in a box.
Sup ?
Hmm. Let's try a similar but different route.
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pip/Octology/master/gfx/sho/Octology-cros-shot_3840x2160-K44MHuBF.png
Ok.
10q
Nope.
samesame
Can you see HTTPS://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology ?
It should also be linked at the bottom of that page.
HOP
(Hold on please.)
Take your time.
w8ing is a gift, so: Thank you.  üòâ
Yer wLcome.
I think I've got a CPU usage
problem.  I know how to
fix it -- but is time-intensive.
Why don't you tell me
about what you added --
but please use words I
can understand.
üòä
Well if you've seen the huge list of 8-words in my Octology ~/dox/2du/8.utf file && look for the yellow letters in the upper-left of the screenshot you can see the primary groups of pre-cursor letters to the 8 in their words, so I've arranged the groups by size && color into a 3x3 grid of the terminal.
Ok.  That is clear.
Thank you.
I've added the stretching of the r8 block to nest into the crux more widely in the lower-left screen.
GOP
Ok.
Why "more widely" ?
To fit more prefixes into the space available.
Ok.
Got it.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
If you see the 7x5 block of colored letters along the left side of the upper-right screen (starting "IVLvNUP") that is the core crux of my crosses of light && life.
It's exploded in the center, with smooshed up words attempting to highlight the letter of their block && directionality when possible.
Then the blocks expand into the big list of words to pack in mostly prefixes.
So you can see along the right side of the lower-right screen the r8 block starts with "c f g i o p t u ..." because crate, freight, gate, irate, orate, prate, trait, && urate are the first smallest words sorted into that block.
Does it start making some sense to you, or do you have any questions?
I do have Qs -- yes.
But first --
I have goood gnus.
Goood! What is it?  üòä
I believe I have it on-screen now.
üòä
Yaaa !!
Sat Apr    4  17:56:14
Is that it ?
Sorry. I got confused. Is the date in the shot your goood news?

Here's what I've got.
Is that it ?
Yep. That's the result of my upd8s to `8plc`, my "8-Pre-Cursor Letter Counter".
Good.
But --
Other than that "dateline"
-- everything else is too
small to read.
What is the secret ?
Zoom functionality, like maybe Control-Equals or Control-Shift-Equals in most browsers.
Or open it in an image-editor where there's more likely fine control of scaling.
Hold please.
Trying 'em.
Happy  to hold.
I had tried Plan B
several minutes ago.
No avail.
Zoomup there makes a mess
of un-read-ability.
Trying Plan A now.
BBS
Ah ha.
That works great.
Very clean.
Very readable.
Thank you.
Now.
You're welcome.
Point me to things please.
Thanks for checking out my latest results.
The crux mainly maps the 35 pre-cursor letters into a 7x5 block emphasized largest in the upper-right screen.
Traveling to upper-right ...
Then the blocks are built around the crux in the lower-right && made to fit almost all words in the lower-left.
W8 please.
Ok.  I'm at U.R. area.
Tell me what I'm looking at please.
Well the very top-right of the upper-right screen shows total character counts throughout the entire 8.utf file (the list of which extends a good bit above what's shown).
Then the left side shows 3 Pre-cursor Letter block arrangements. The one near the middle of the left side is the main 7x5 which is expanded upon in the center.
In very UR -- I see    7AJ,
Are we together ?
Yep.
I'm there now too.
-- preceded by       29,331:
7AJ is a base-64 number-string which expands into the decimal 29,331 which is just before it, yeah.
What is this telling me please ?
2 equivalent ways to represent the same number.
But what does this do for me
The number is the count of the character 'a' throughout the entire 8.utf file.
-- a regular person ?
No person.
The letter 'a' appears that many time in the whole file.
s/time/times/;
And why is that important
to a non-programmer ?
It's useful for knowing the frequency of occurrences. It's not important to a non-programmer really... yet. Maybe someday it will be though.
Those character counts are not as important (even to programmers) as the crux map which follows them.
Good.
Where is the "crux map" ?
I'm still at UR.
It starts in the upper-right screen with the Magenta "Precursor" then Yellow "Letters" && it ends with "MountMovMnt".
Ok.
Hold please.
Good.
Ok.
I see those 16 lines.
Now.  Help me here Pip.
Look at it with my eyes --
and tell me what it
communicates to me please.
I don't know the first thing about looking at anything with your eyes. It probably communic8s a meaningless mash-up of few discernible real words in too many colors with few patterns that stand out to you?
You were wrong.
You did look at it with my eyes.
And described it precisely !!
When you and I chat --
you tell me things.
You teach me.
You send me mental picture.
You enhance my life.
You fill my "how" basket.
How does Octology also
do those kinds of things
The key is the 7x5 block beside the "gospels.net" in the background. It is expanded into the 15 lines in the center, where each letter appears again with space to include some directional words using those letters (in the same colors).
for me ?
Octology might do better things for you if you get to run it yourself someday. You'll probably just need to install CygWin && a few dependencies before it almost all of it should be able to be run locally there.
Yes, how does Octology also do those kinds of things for you?
Am I to answer that one --
or are you going to answer it
for me ?
Oh, I don't know.
I'll accept that.
Thank you.
Thank you too.
You're welcome Pip.
Can we go to an associated topic ?
Sure.
You mentioned the "gospels.net".
Comments follow.
You sent me 2 assignments

Now ...
Cool. Thanks for checking those out.
Can we talk about #1 ?
What did you think of Bret and Heather ?
I've read through the Gospel of Philip once so far, but would like to rE-rEad it again soon.
Yeah, I really appreC8 Bret && Heather sharing their advice && encouragement && answering pressing questions, providing some good guidance.
Put you at peace a bit ?
Did they ?
Yes. For you some too?
No. 
I live in peas.
Oh, right.
A wonderful vegetable !!
4 things -- every human being

I will respond to your
comment -- before going

Good for you Pip.
Cool. Didn't mean to de-rail you, but hopefully we can get back on your original track shortly.
I know I keep telling you
this -- but you need to hear
it over & over:
You are on track -- on
course -- you are perfect
Pip.
----------------------
Ok.
Thank you for thinking && saying so. It's true that I retain a flawed image of myself, but maybe I need to do more mirror work too, eh?
Abs  sew  root  Lee  !!
And -- you're welcome.
Jus callin em as eye sea em.
And I see you on the mountaintops.
Maybe not there yet.
But constantly climbing.

You wanna complete that one ?
Peace.
Whirled peas.
You got it Honey !!
Whirled peas.
FTR's 21-year goal.
Are the number in that order
for a reason.
Possibly.
But -- if so -- I am
not privy to that reason.
Most of us
live without much of
any one of them
most of the time.
However --
It is rather interesting
that -- if we "focus" (Pc#28)
on the "odd" 2 --
the "even" 2 --
just kinda follow along
on their own.
(//)
I see. That's goood.
Nope.
Sorry.
Scratch that.
Numbers wrong.
Permiso to redo please ?
Yes.
Thank you.
Correction follows.
If we focus on the first 2
-- the last 2 just
follow on their own.
Yes.
Now we've got it.
You understand ?
Let me go over it a bit more. I'll get it.
I'll help here.
We need not chase either
Health, nor Fulfillment.
If we search after Peace & Happiness
-- Health & Fulfillment
MUST follow.
Gotta.
(//)
Sense makes ?
Yes.
Thank you.
Good.
You're a smart guy.
Almost as smart as Ange !!
Sometimes. Maybe often.
I don't know about that. She could be somewhat far from me either way, sometimes.
Whatever you say My Lord.
You're de boss.
I could easily be wrong. Maybe I trail her almost always pretty close.
I wonder how well you or I know her at all recently to judge, or anticip8 from extrapol8ion or whatever.
"lord"  means  "boss"
"Lord" is the 14th most
frequent word in The Bible.
That seems like an obscure thing to know. I'm glad you do though.
What ?
Angie's geniosity --
The most frequent words in the Bible.
or the "lord" freq ?
Yeah.
No.
Actually not.
About 28 years ago -- before the
web really got rolling --
I wanted a good software
So do you commune with your Father G-d L-rd in Heaven through His Holy Spirit every day?
version of a Bible concordance.
Found none that suited me.
So -- I wrote my own.
Learned a lot of stuff.
Word frequencies among them.
-----------------------
Nice. Does it run on GNU/Linux, or only MicroSoft Windows so far?
Neither.
Wrote it in DOS.
Using "BASIC".
Ah. Have you run it recently?
Yep.
Use it (at least) once a week.
Often oftener.
Right on! Is there a chance you could please share a copy of the source with me sometime? I haven't examined any BASIC in years.
I'll think about that.
There are probably tons
of much better concordance
programs out there now.
I last tweaked mine in
January of 2001.
I had to stop developing
it -- because BASIC has
a "bytes cap" of
about 74,000.
So -- a number of enhancements
that I had hoped to include
-- had to be waived.
It works.
And I use it.
Cool. Nice work.  üòä 
But it's not exquisite.
And -- exquisite Xcellence
is always my target --
in everything !!
Thank you Pip.
You're welcome Dad.
Even though you've spent your life in service of G-d, is He still so vast that you cannot know Him well?
What a great question Philip !!
Let me go get something you
said a bit earlier this evening.
BBS
Okay.
Here it is.
Wow.
It was in the first couple
of minutes of this chat.
You said:
It was mostly gr8, but I've been more pensive than usual, contempl8ing the existence of G-d, the ramific8ions, how to seek to know Him more earnestly, whether it might be adversarial or better to be allies, whether servant is better than slave... a lot of weird stuff to mastic8.
And (in there) were a number
of things that I could have
commented on.  And now
(I think) is the time.
Just now you asked:
Even though you've spent your life in service of G-d, is He still so vast that you cannot know Him well?
These 2 tie together.
" ... whether servant is better than slave ... "
-- in the first one.
" ... in service of God ... "
-- in the second one.
Let me see if I can shed
a little light on this
relationship.
We     do not     serve God.
This is a confusing area.
We do.
But -- in the way that
most people think of it
-- we don't.
You see.  When most people
use the word "God" -- they
are essentially thinking of
"The Father".
And -- we (most assuredly)
are not supposed to attempt
to serve Our Father.
That is not "the design" --
and not (at all) what He
wants.
There are 3 persons in
The Trinity.  All 3 are
(equally) God.  But
each of the 3 have
a set of primary
"job descriptions".
And The Father (Person #1)
is to serve us !!
And we -- are Person #2.
Now -- that's the first part.
The part that we do not
serve God (The Father).
God (The Father)
serves us.
Now.  Let's get to
the 2nd part.  The
part where we (the 2nd Person)
do serve God.
Do we serve #1 (The Father) ?
No.
Do we serve #3 (Sis) ?
No.
So then.
There is only one more left.
Do we serve #2 ?
Yep.
And who is the 2nd Person
of God ?
Answer is:
Christ.
And what is the definition of
Christ ?
God -- in a
skinsuit.
You are Christ.
Angie is Christ.
Mom is Christ.
Katy is Christ.
Mandy is Christ.
I believe you get the idea.
I don't have to name them all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That is who we are to serve.
God -- in the blllions
of his (and her) skinsuits.
Yes.  I am not done here.
But -- shall pause for
comment(s) or question(s).
(//)
None right now.
Ok.
I continue.
That (above) addressed the
first one.
Now -- let's address the
2nd one  :::
Even though you've spent your life in service of G-d, is He still so vast that you cannot know Him well?
We'll ignor the section "A" of that
-- as we just covered that.
And I'll respond to the section "B" of it:
" Is He still so vast that you cannot know Him well? "
He will always be "that" vast.
Always.
That's one of the most
wonderful things about Him.
He is depthless.
Or -- more accurately:
bottomless.
Unsearchably depthful !!
Now -- let's get at the
"know Him well" part.
The word "know" is used in
many different ways.  But --
is common-day (normal)
usage -- it is not a very
strong "knowery" that we
customarily mean when we
use the word "know".
However.
The original meaning of
the word "know" -- and the
meaning that we are
usually to hold -- when
encountering it in
Scripture is:
"to be (or become) one with".
So.
Knowing God
is actually about
becoming Him.
And that is what He
wants for each one
of us.
To "walk" Him.
Here on earth.
The Father has
no legs.
Sounds like a serious challenge.
He is entirely spirit.
No body.
No legs.
We (the 2nd person
of God) are the legs
of our Father.
His job is to teach us
How to walk Him.
How to talk Him.
How to do Him.
How to be Him.
If the 1st-person Father is purely spirit, can He be identifiable enough to discern that it's really Him && not some impostor attempting to interact with the Son or Holy Ghost?
Yeshua didn't come
here (primarily) to do
the "Easter" thing.
That was just a "side job".
He came to show us how
to BE God.
Walking, talking, doing, being.
Ok enuff on that for now.
I see you have asked
another Q.
If the 1st-person Father is purely spirit, can He be identifiable enough to discern that it's really Him && not some impostor attempting to interact with the Son or Holy Ghost?
Great question !!
It would be gr8 if Y'shua could have a much less painful re-enactment of the walking among && teaching that occurred through his Earthly ministry those thousands of years ago around 0 C.E..
Let's let Sis (the Holy Ghost)
out of this casserole for now.
She is a whole 'nother lesson.
The simple answer to your
question is:
Yeah. Sorry I've not pre-scripted these questions well enough to isol8 complexities && such.
Yes -- there are plenty of
"imposter" spirits.
You're typing.
Go ahead on.
Doesn't the living Son of God or man have at least physical manifest8ion that can be contextualized within the world in ways that purely spirit cannot authentic8 with? I'm not sure why not though, if they know how to make impacts that they intend for.
What do you think ?
I think: "Possibly?"
Good answer.
Want to go on ?
Maybe the billions of God's children are those who are all 3: God, skin-suit, && spirit I guess?
We can go on.
You stuck a "?" at the end
of that -- but -- It more
(to me) sounded
like a comment.
Yeah, it didn't end up phrased as a question really, but was rather inflection about an uncertain sentence conclusion.
Say a bit more please.
If God creates && sustains life && humans are His kids, then we live physically, as Gods as well (yet limited by material), then we may have spirit or soul in addition which is another thing to become trustworthy when interwoven among living God-beings.
You have that (whole thing)
pretty well (masterfully)
nailed down.  Excellent Pip.
Thank you.
I'd just like to throw in
a couple of tweaks.
You're welcome son.
Okay.
You said:
"we may have spirit or soul in addition"
These 2 words are nearly
universally confused.
Even our dictionaries add
to this confusion -- instead of
I could have meant "... spirit &&/or soul ..." to suggest either or both.
clearing it up -- as they are
supposed to.  But --
I need not say more on the
lexicography here.
Let's get into the
"spirit / soul" thing.
Okay.
You do not "have" a spirit.
You are a spirit.
You are the spirit
which created the universe.
And that spirit's name
is God.
You are God.
We can do much more
on the subject of spirits
Well a sometimes constrained meat-sack version of that spirit though, when we can do much less, I think.
(probably at another time)
-- but now let's address
the word: "soul".
I do not have a definition
for the word "soul".
I hold one in my head.
But I do not normally share it
-- or write it down.  Because
-- over the years -- as I
have asked My Father for
a definition of the word
"soul" -- He has always
declined to give it to me.
He says:
Hmm. Sounds familiar somewhat.
I have given you 2 Axioms
-- both of which have that word
in them.  And -- I shall leave it
to you -- to see if you can see
-- what you are searching for
in your question.
(//)
What are the 2 Axiom mentions?
15 and 16.
Do you have those ?
Those would fill in a gap for me, so I'd have from 14 through 19 after those.
Oh     gap     gap     gap   
Here they come.
Get ready to copy please.
--------------------------------------
Axiom #15:
I own but one thing:  this moment in time
with God, and therein lies my soul.
Axiom #15.
-------------------------------
Axiom #16:
Copied 15.
Save my soul, I own nothing, but am only
temporary custodian of that which I am
touching at the moment.
Axiom #16.
--------------------------
Just one thing I would like to
Thanks.
point out (in #16) --
The word "save" means:
"with the exception of".
-----------------------
You're welcome.
If a soul can scarcely be described, how can it be a something which can claim ownership of more than a little something when stripped of all but touching? Not sure if I could word that right.
Figures.
üòä
Not sure I understand it either.
Want to re-word it ?
Heh... not as much.  üòâ
lol
Maybe a soul that was more substantial in a personal form would be the claim to ownership more than purely ephemeral as I imagine it. Would you think so too?
Not a clue.
Let me tell you a short story.
Permiso ?
Yep.
Ok.
Thank you.
Story follows.
The Axioms are about 37
years old.  At least -- from
the time that I received them.
I have been chewing on them
for that long.  And using
them in my life -- to the
best of my ability to do so.
Have I got them all milked-out
yet ?  I'm sure not.
But -- if you would like to
If you're the most 1st-person God the Father-like human father alive, does that mainly align your walk && soul with His so speaking in any manner with you is akin to speaking to Him pretty closely?
chew on 15 & 16 -- and
bring up this "soul" thing
again in 2057 -- I think
I'd be fine with that.
(end-of-story)
(//)
I mainly think of fantasy "Soul Calibur", my favorite video-game franchise, as a main word-assoC8ion, not necessarily spiritual but still leaning meta-physical somewhat.
Thank you for that story && for sharing 15 && 16 with me there.
You are very welcome Pip.
My pleasure.
I ‚ù§ stories.
I ‚ù§ stories too.
üòä
Ok.
Another question.
You said:
If you're the most 1st-person God the Father-like human father alive, does that mainly align your walk && soul with His so speaking in any manner with you is akin to speaking to Him pretty closely?
I think I know what you're
getting at there -- but could you
please re-ask it in 15 words
or less -- and without the
Fair. Are you the living God the Father?
leading "if" clause ?
Are you asking if I am
God The Father ?
Are you Him, the One who sent his Son to die yet live?
Tough question.
But a (very) good one.
Let me see if I can do this.
How are you to "see" me ?
That one is easy.
You are to see me as
your brother.
Video-chat while we do whatever.
You are Christ.
I am Christ.
Christ may be thought of
as "a body".  Albeit --
Why don't you prefer Moshiach to "Christ"?
a non-physical body.
But still a body.  A "spiritual" body.
So.  We (you and I) are
one body.  But each of us
are members (parts, if you wish)
of the same one body.
And that body is:  Christ.
(God, showing up on earth
in the billions of skinsuits.)
However.
Having said that -- I now
shall add -- I and My Father
are one.  Not one person.
But nevertheless -- one spirit.
One God.
Let's ask again.
Am I "Gerry Stuart"
(Pip's earthy Dad)
God The Father ?
If God && man can both seem capricious on limited time-scales, how can there be confidence in one spirit, even if already not one person, but still maybe of the same Messiah body?
Technically -- no.
However -- you will see
similarities between us which
will make it almost impossible
to know with whom you are
communicating.  And --
2 more things about that:
(1)   I am more like Him today
        than I was yesterday
        -- and that growth
        never stops.
(2)   Also -- what I have
I'm also curious about what the anointing with olive-oil does, even just symbolically or traditionally. Significance?
        with Him -- is what
        He also want you to
        have with Him too.
The bottom line (and a very
funny thing to imagine too)
is that his desire is that
all of His children become
so-like-Him -- that none
of us will know if the "person"
in front of us is just a regular
human -- or actually The Father
speaking (and acting) through
what seems to be:
That's powerful. 
a tent of flesh.
(//)
Yep.
Tis indeed.
Now ...
Thank you both!
We both say:
You're welcome -- My Brother.
You're welcome -- My Son.
While I was answering that one
Is it okay if I'm more the body && flesh of Messiah rather than "Christ", or do I need to embrace both terms to be proper Brother && Son, my Lord?
-- you slipped in 1 comments -- and
3 more questions.
And now -- here is a 4th question too.
lol
Which do you wish I should
respond to first My Lord ?
Any or none. I can w8.
(//)
Ok.
Thank you.
We'll tackle the last first.
Is it okay if I'm more the body && flesh of Messiah rather than "Christ", or do I need to embrace both terms to be proper Brother && Son, my Lord?
Proposal: Point-of-Light #13 should have a selah caesura appended to it. Thoughts?
Sorry.  Had to reload Gmail
-- a number of times.
No worry.
Is it okay if I'm more the body && flesh of Messiah rather than "Christ", or do I need to embrace both terms to be proper Brother && Son, my Lord?
Moshiach
Messiah
Christ
-- all synonyms.
All same-same.
Distinct connot8ions at least?
Which used -- doesn't matter.
No distinctions.
Just language.
Maybe there shouldn't be, but in some ways I think there still are.
Ok.
Tell me please.
There has been considerable thought as I gleaned it that Y'shua was preaching to Hebrews but it was Rav' Sha'ul (Paul, the ex-Pharisee I think) who broadened the message to the gentile as well.
Maybe that's kinda irrelevant.
Christ assoC8s much more closely with historical Catholicism && modern Christianity, which would appear rather starkly distinct adjacent a Messianic Jewish Synagogue, to me.
Maybe it's a mountain out of mole-hills, but I think the tradition from which each concept && manifest8ion sprang was somewhat unique, but I wasn't there back then, so who knows?!
I understand what you say
-- I think.
Here is my story.
Why do I prefer -- and nearly 
exclusively -- use the word 
"Christ" ?
Understandability -- for my listeners.
Many non-Jewish will not "get it" --
if I use the Hebrewish terms.
But (usually) ALL Hebrew speakers
-- understand that the word
"Christ" means Messiah -- or
Moshiach.
(//)
I think you're sacrificing some precious authenticity by pronouncing Greek rather than Hebrew, but maybe it's negligible.
You are correct.
The "authenticity" is missing.
However -- there are a large
block of people who
Or maybe regard for the force the original words in context had?
are not familiar with much
of the Old Testament
at all.  And I do not wish
to "lose them" when
I speak.
Fair enough. I don't really understand how to measure for the broadest audience like you must.
Maybe you'll have advanced seminars where you worry less about losing them.
When we do Seminars in
The San Fernando Valley --
Ah. We.
or New York City -- I may
(very well) change my
terms.
Yes.
We.
I the beginning times --
you will still be in
Will Angie join us maybe?
Osh.  But -- down the road
-- this will not always be
the case.
Angie will not join us ever!
Unless ...
something else occurs
first.
(//)
Not in SFValley to see a Seminar or say "Hi!"?
When was the last time she
came to Oshkosh to say
"Hi" to you ?
She hasn't visited since I've had to move down here from Appleton, unless I'm forgetting an early time after 2015.
Ok.
So what makes you think
she would travel from Missouri
to California to say
Hi to you ?
Because she could visit Tim && Manders && kids mainly but could say "Whassup?" to me && get to know you a bit. She had some interest in visiting you together back when I'd query her about the prospect.
In 1996 -- you told me that
Angie wanted to come
(with you) to see me.
You did not come.
She did not come.
No.
She indic8d that she might be interested, if we put a plan together.
I take that back.
You did come --
in 2007.
But she has not
come yet.
I've wanted to visit again since 2007, but haven't been able to at all recently.
And -- I do not expect
her to change her mind.
I have no issue with
our 13-year interval.
You and I are fine.
I haven't come to
see you in 13 years
either.
True dat!
Changes are coming.
We've stayed in pretty close touch via GMail I'd say, thankfully.
In fact -- they are here.
We are (living) already
in them.
For joy !!    For joy !!   
It's all you Pip.
Rejoice!  üòä
You wanted weekly chats.
You asked me for them.
I said yes.
All your fault Pip.
üòä
Indeed. Blame me.  üòâ
lol
So have you been watching on average a good movie each day?
I wouldn't guarantee that
they are always "good".
But -- that is part of my
verrrrrry lonnnng report
which is cued up
here on the shipping dock.
You'll get it --
when you command it.
(//)
You know how you said last night that your Father gave you His glasses to see through divorce... well can you also use them to see out of my glasses sometimes too?
Not sure what you mean.
Help ?
Me either. Was just thinking that maybe pairs of eye-glasses can become like quantum-entangled with each other && each display what the other sees instead, or something. Maybe the shared body of Christ can cover that with many bodies making up the whole. Hmm.
Hmm back atchah.
You are typing.
Are you familiar with the word: "Yate"?
Nope.
Wanna share ?
Searches hardly have results but I've found it to be an obsolete form of "Gate".
Ok.
It is also a Spanish word.
Just interested me a bit. It's the only 8-word I've encountered with a "y" before the "ate". Ah... "yah-tey" too.
Also a kind of eucalyptus tree.
Nice.
Smells good -- anyway.
üòä
Is that what pandas mostly eat?
more Gmail problems
Sorry.
It's okay.
Hopefully it will improve soon.
It's perfect !!
Is that what pandas mostly eat?
Eye doan no.
'Aven't scene a panda in
Pennsylvania in quite a while.
Well.
Are you going to command
a report soon ?
I was content to w8 longer, but please produce it now, if you'd like to.
lol
I can w8.
mmm mmm  mmm  mmm mmm mmmm
You like my song ?
Hard to make out the rhythm or melody, but sure... it's a nice song there.  üòâ
‚ô´ mmm  mmmmm  mmmmmm ‚ô´  mmm  mmmm ‚ô´
Is that better ?
A bit. It's probably Chicago.
It is !!
I'm impressed.
"A Hard Habit To Break"
-- is the name of it.
Very GOOD Pip.
Alright.
The w8 is over.
Thee Report cometh.

++++++++++++++++++++
This is the Report on the results
of the "5-Point" Plan from last
Friday's Chat (March 27 2020).
First -- here is the entire Plan.

I shall now report on how we did
on each Point of the Plan.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
(Report on "The Plan", Point #1)
(1)   Even though "I don't feel like it" 
        I will spend (at least) 1 hour
        on the TNP-2002 letter --
        before putting Pip's Pappy
        into the crib tonight.
Of course -- this was a very wise 
affirmation that you gave to me 
on this matter, Philip.
It uses the age-old maxim:
                       Just Start It

And I did.  And -- as the "doing"
(then) produces an internal "juice"
-- the doer finds himself both
energized and enthused -- amidst 
the rushes within.  And when the
proposed "at-least" has expired --
the spirit (the doer's inclination) 
(his fire) (his leaning) toward the 
project -- can not easily be extinguished.
And thereby -- he proceeds on -- in it.
Thank you for your wisdom in this Philip.
You're totally welcome Dad.
üòä
And as you knew it would -- my "1-hour" 
turned into 5.2 hours.  And even besides 
the vast accomplishment -- I was also
fervently filled with joy throughout it.
I love you Son.
‚ù§
(End of Report on "The Plan", Point #1)
I love you Dad.  ‚ù§ 
Thank you so much.
Warms my heart.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
(Report on "The Plan", Point #2)
(2)   I will hang 1 "I like myself"
        before hitting the sack
        -- and a dozen (or so) more
        after sunup on Saturday (28)
        morning.
I DID hang 1 "ILM" poster 
before hitting the sack on 
Saturday morning March 28 2020.
It wasn't fancy (or pretty).  
Not yet done on Tera.
Just hand lettered.
But -- it got the message across.
             Which was its purpp.
Good.
Thank you.
Then -- Saturday night -- I crafted
2 "night screens" for myself -- on
Tera -- which I have been using ever
since (during my snooze-times).
     I believe I have mentioned 
     my "night-screens" before. 
As I am in bed -- I happen to be facing
Tera's screen.  So -- my night-screens
always make my last vision before sleep
-- and my first (after): whatever I have
decided to display there.
Here are they -- which are also the same
as the ones that I "papered" for posting
on the all of my every walls:


By the end of the weekend 
(Sunday night) I had another 
7 up -- in the bathroom & kitchen.
And then -- on Monday (03-30-20) -- I 
completely plastered all of the other
"ILM" posters -- in the office/bedroom,
and the "dining" area (which is majorly
used as an "open-closet") making a grand 
total of 17 "I Like Myself" posters --
throughout my 396-square-foot apartment.
It is now impossible to be anywhere in 
my "Franklin Street Homestead" -- if you
are (a) conscious, and (b) have your lids 
up -- and fail to see (at least) 1 "ILM"
poster somewhere.
Of course -- for the specific sake of the
2 (former) "recent-year struggles" in the
27,998-day "breathery history" of Pip's 
Dad -- we have hung an appropriate:
‚Ä¢  "I Like Myself" above the refrigerator
‚Ä¢  "I Like Myself" above Tera's screen
So.   As: it it not possible to WATCH
         a movie without one's eyes open 
         -- there is (now) NO EXCUSE for 
         a failure to please Katy in that 
         department.
And.  Since: the (normal) prepar8ion involved
          -- for shoveling vittles into one's 
          frontal cranial orifice -- is rarely
          attempted without one's eyes open -- 
          any failing(s) in the "Eating As Josh" 
          arena -- should also be considered to 
          only be possible -- IF -- Pip's Dad is
          in a state of ambulansque dormitet.

                      (it's Latin)
(End of Report on "The Plan", Point #2)
Thank you.
You're welcome Pip.
All your fault.
You made me do it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
(Report on "The Plan", Point #3)
(3)   I will eat as Josh -- and make
       Pip & Katy & me happy.

Xcellent.
As you can see in the EAJ Report --
according to the numbers -- I was 
"liking myself" quite well this week.
Thank you.
However.  I must also (needs to) add
that:  I DID have one "dip" in my
"resolve" on Monday morning. 
You're welcome. Good to see you on-track.
Yes.  I agree.
I could not hold myself to make 
  it a "fast" day -- as is my usual 
  (Monday) do.
            Yet.  I DID do it on Tuesday.
       And so.  For that.  I LIKE MYSELF.
 
(End of Report on "The Plan", Point #3)
Thank you for that Report on Point #3.
You're welcome.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
(Report on "The Plan", Point #4)
(4)   I will hold my movie watching
        to 1 per day -- for the next
        21 days.
I have done this now for 8 days in a row
(Sat Mar 28 through Sat Apr 04 2020).
And -- on Tuesday (March 31) it wasn't
even a "1".  It was a "0".  So:
                I LIKE MYSELF.
And -- it's all your fault too.
Gr8!
Thank you Pip.
You're welcome Dad.
I'm smiling too.

(Report on "The Plan", Point #5)
(5)   I will like myself -- especially
        because my behavior warrants it.
I did this this week.
And I thank you so much -- for both your
concern and your support.  You are a very
wise, loving, and cherished mentor, Pip.
And I am so fortunate to have you.
                 Blessed. 
Aww. You're welcome Dad. I'm blessed to have you too.
I believe David would have said:
"My cup runneth over!"
(Ps 23:5c)
             I LIKE MYSELF.

And -- this past week -- my 
behavior quite warranted it!
             Thank you My Lord.

Note on the "Tue Mar 31 2020" do.
I have 2 major bills:
     ‚Ä¢  rent
     ‚Ä¢  ISP
Although they are monthly obligations
-- I pay them semi-annually.  It's just
easier.  And -- this past Tuesday (31)
was when I did that -- along with a few
minor financials too.

Ready for a little comment ?
Yep.
Ok.
Here comes
Don't believe everything 
  you find on the web.
It ain't all accurate.
Like the C-19 stuff.
What's open & what's closed.
Libraries closed ?  Yes.  They are.
Banks open ?  Many are.  But mine snot!
Although I use my debit card for 
more than 95% of my purchases --
I DO use cash for some (occasionally).
And how/where do get the greenbacks ?
I go to my bank for 'em.
            I haven't used an ATM 
               for nearly 30 years.
But as of today -- after finding 
out that my bank branch is latched
-- looks like that is going to change.
            Se la vie.
        All is perfect.
          Piece 5b
üòä
Are those equivalent? No accidents means all perfect?
Yep.
Basically -- yes.
They come from the same source.
Romans 8:28.
But -- when we do "the lesson"
on each one -- the emphasis
is different.
But yes.
You're right.
The sentiments are
equivalent.
Very good Pip.
All being perfect seems to have much wider ramific8ions to me than there merely being no accidents, but maybe they're sides of the same coin.
Well -- now you've done it !!
Do I hafta launch into a
mini-lesson on each one ?
Naa.
Sure.
Or not.
I need a bathroom break.
I think not.
Be Back in a Bit.
Take your bathroom break.
Take your time.
I'll think about what I
want to say here.
Ok.
I've thunk it over.
I believe I'll let the
text of those 2 lessons
w8 for another time.
But -- I will just say that
everything is (totally) in
Father's Hand.
Nothing happens without
His finger being in it.
Nothing.
Ever.
(//)
Back.
Me too.
There's the "perfect / no accident" thing.
Sufficient for now ?
Yeah.
Good.
Anything else on your PCA
for this evening ?
Not for now.
Aren't you going to ask me too ?
Yes.
Anything else on your PCA for tonight?
Yes.
Thank you for asking.
üòä
I saved the "light" one
for the "closer".
Ready ?
Yup.
Permiso ?
Thank you.
Here comes.
Last night (2301G/2201P) -- I mentioned
that today (Sat Apr 4 2020) would be a
56-year anniversary.
Well -- that's not accurate -- 
on the dates.
Off by one day.
I wrote this on Saturday.
Got it.
Expecting that I would be
sharing in with you (also)
on Saturday.
But -- as you just said:
you "got" it.
So -- I'll continue (as if Sat).
Yep.  Something happened exactly 2922
weeks ago (20,454 days) on Saturday,
April 4th, 1964 -- which had never
happened before.
And it's highly (HIGHLY!) unlikely
-- that it will EVER happen again.

Those Fabulous Four from Liverpool
-- had ALL 5 of the chart-topping
songs on the American Hot 100.
                And not only that.

The Beatles also had 7 other songs 
peppering the Hot 100 chart --
making a whopping 12 Beatles songs 
on that week‚Äôs Hot 100 !!
                     Plus ...
Wow! What champions.

That same week -- The Beatles also 
held the top two slots on Billboard‚Äôs 
albums chart:

Neither of these 2 U.S. chart 
records have ever been broken.
-----------------------------------------
How big were The Beatles ?
Hmm.  Not sure I can actually answer that.
But -- to give you an idea ...
let's try another question.
The Beatles first came to America
in February of 1964 -- 56 years ere.
          And here is the question 
          with an incredible answer:
       How big are the Beatles today ?
         Wikipedia recently did a 
"Topics Most Frequently Requested"
                      report.
The list was of the top 1000.
#2 through #5 had very strong numbers.
But -- the frequency of #1 was
3 TIMES the frequency of #2!
                           3 TIMES !!!
And #1 was  (of course)  THE BEATLES.

                       (applause please goes here)
Applause!!
             Thank you.               Thank you very much.
Well should we about call it bed-time?
No.
Not bed time.
lol
My mommy said that
9 o'clock is my bedtime.
So.
We must have nearly
7 hours to go yet --
before I have to go
to bed.
What would you like to
do before bedtime ?
Nothing else I can think of right away.
How 'bout some roller sk8ing.
I haven't been for a while.
Or -- is the SA
or PNS still open.
About 1:20 am there -- right ?
All 3 probably closed for most of the time until 9am, yeah.
Oh well.
All is perfect.
So.
Thank you for this great chat Pip.
I ‚ù§ you.
You're welcome Dad. Thank you too. I love you!  ‚ù§ 
Shall we do this again
Let's!
on the 10th ?
Yes.
'Sa date.
You are Darjee have plans
for later today ?
None yet.
/are/  /and/
Ok.
Hopefully catch some sun.
You'll thinka something.
Sun sounds good.
We have not really had more
than 1 or 2 "spring" days
in the past 6 weeks.
Still quite cold.
Makes me think I might
be in Minnesota again.
1958 was my last time there.
August.
Nice.
I'
Oops.
I'  ?
I've been to the twin cities several times.
And ?
I like it there too.
Was that when Mom was
schooling there ?
Once then && a couple times after.
Nice.
What did you do / see ?
Roger Waters with Lennon backup singers for the Wall Tour, && visiting a woman I was interested in at the time named Rabiha.
Ok.
Still in touch with her ?
Not at all since back then.
Was Waters any good ?
Heard she got happily married somewhere along the East-Coast.
Waters was awesome. Whole show was rad!
Haven't heard of him.
Pink Floyd.
Far out.
Yeah, Kippy && Pat Lennon && one of their brothers I don't really know && forget his name all sang backup && wore cool costumes as part of the show. Amazing visuals && physical wall construction && props && puppets && High-Def visualiz8ions. Gr8 experience.
Interesting.
He is a bassist.
Me too.
He looks like Richard Gere.
I can see that.
Neat.
Did Mom go with you ?
Yeah, && Rosie && Noah.
Sweet.
Rabiha too ?
I brought a little marijuana && puffed on it outside before the show started too. Got a little stoned for the start.
No Rabiha.
When was this ?
'94 ?
Probably 2012 or so.
Web says Jyly 2005 was last.
Is that wrong ?
/Jyly/  /July/
Pretty sure it was around 2011 or 2012.
Ok.
I'll go with your date.
Web gets stuff wrong
all the time.
Yep. Okay, well have a good rest of your night Dad. I'll look forward to chatting again on Friday.  üòä  ‚ù§ 
Yes -- I see it now.
Okay Pip.
‚ù§
üòä
Good night sweet son.
0'04-05-20 - 0239 Gtime / 0139 Ptime
0'04-19-20 - 2245 Gtime / 2145 Ptime (not stamped in chat with this, excerped from GChat at this time)
                                                                                              Yes, my questions.
                                                                                              In our previous chats, I seem to recall you indic8ing that you believed CoViD-19 might be a "Plan-B" of sorts by God as judgment for people who re-married. Maybe you only implied this though. Is that what you really think is occurring around the globe now, or how do you see the CoronaVirus? Have you tracked its stats at all?

I shall (first) offer a preface.  And then respond to your 2 questions   ¬∂   Preface:   Yes.  I did say "Plan-B".  ¬∂   Now -- as answer to the 2nd question:  No I have not tracked its stats at all.  Wondered -- yes.  Tracked -- no.   ¬∂   I pause here.  You may comment or "follow-up" question -- or I shall go on to the 1st question you asked.
(//)

                                                                                              FYI (For Your Inform8ion), JHU (Johns Hopkins University) has been collecting relevant d8a && making it available on GitHub, if you ever become interested. I also have several other sources I could share with you. Despite Pennsylvania having a much smaller popul8ion than California, it worryingly has thousands more confirmed cases (even if the death r8s remain similar at around 3.75% of confirmed cases presently).

Thank you.   ¬∂   I am not allowed to delve into the stats -- even though my natural mind does wonder about them   ¬∂   Another comment -- or I should go on to Q#1 ?
                                                                                              You're welcome. Why aren't you allowed to learn what's happening (regardless of your wonder)?
Great question Pip !!
Our "natural" mind is (sometimes) our friend.   Quite frequently not.  But sometimes -- it is.  ¬∂   You may remember that:  Piece #16 tells us that this 30,000-day time -- here on this earth -- is not "life" -- but is actually "Heaven-School".   ¬∂   And -- that there are only 2 courses in Heaven-School.  And both of them have very to do with:  "trading-in" our natural mind -- and replacing it with:  a new mind.   ¬∂   And how do we acquire that "new mind" ?
NDY
Not Done Yet
The new mind -- which we are to cultivate -- is the very mind of our Father.  We are to learn to "see" as He sees.  And think as He thinks.  And then:  go on to do as He does.  In short -- we are to become Him.
More to come.
                                                                                              How do you know any of this, with confidence or certainty or what?
But -- I pause for C or Q.
Another great question !!
Well -- for starters:  It's all over the Scriptures.
And -- secondarily -- He confirms it when I ask Him questions directly.
(//)
                                                                                              Can you please provide me references to the top few Scriptures that it's "all over"?
Sure.
                                                                                              Thank you.
Rom 12:2.  HTTPS://BibleHub.Com/romans/12.htm
Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will.

You want to look at that one on your own -- or I should send you a link ?
I am glad to look it up on my own, now or l8r. Saving locally in a chat log for future reference now.
https://biblehub.com/romans/12.htm
Thank you. Reading versions of 12:2 now.
This is probably a deeper "rabbit-hole" than we might both wish to tunnel down right now, but I really don't yet see how refusing to be conformed to this world enables one to instead be transformed by renewal of the mind. By what processes does any of this actually occur?
What ways must be refused? What transforms? What is renewed? How? In what ways? When? By what means? I don't get it.
It's ok.
I have others.  But I see 7 questions here.  I think it's still your turn.
Isn't renewal just like restor8ion or rejuven8ion but not transform8ive normally?
Yeah. There's a good 8 for you pick among. Whatever order you wish, me Lord.  üòâ 
Let's step back a moment.  Way back -- as a matter of fact.  And I shall now ask:  What (do you think) Our Father wants from us -- more than anything else ?
I don't believe any gods (or a single "God") exist in any meaningful sense, so it's nobody that wants nothing from us. Just our superstitions and fables and faith and delusions which persuade otherwise. We're simple-minded apes, by-and-large, grasping at straws for explan8ions regarding whatever we couldn't understand or were afraid to try to. Why should I see us (or "Him") differently?
Ok.  Let's set God aside -- for a moment.
Okay.
Another question.
Puedo ?
Yes, please proceed.
Good.  Thank you.  I will.
What (do you think) your (human) Dad wants from you -- more than anything else ?
(only one word)
Love?
Truth?
Trust?
All good words.
Attention?
But they are qualities (within you).
Respect?
No to "respect" too.
But "attention" is getting close.
We are looking for an actual "doing".
Not a characteristic or a quality.
A "doing" please.
I out of good guesses. Maybe please provide me a hint?
Sure.
Ooops. s/I out/I am out/;
What are we doing here -- now ?
Conversing?
Yep.
Is that not what all fathers and mothers want with their children -- more than anything else ?
Face-time.
Conversation -- is the answer.
#1.
I am quite sure many fathers and mothers do not want face-time or to converse with their children more than anything else.
Always !!
Ok.
I'm listening.
Maybe many do, under ideal circumstances, but at least I am an exception && many others seem to be as well.
What do you want from me -- more than anything else ?
Everything you could care to impart to me, equip me with, convey to me, open my eyes toward, etc..
The words "impart"  "equip"  "convey"  -- all sound pretty much like conversation to me.  Don't they to you ?
I want your love, truth, trust, attention, respect, affection, pride, wisdom, ... more than stuff that seems to be none of those.
Okay, yeah, partly. Hmm. Maybe you're right that those are transmitted through convers8ion.
But also by example. I haven't heard your vocal cords vibr8 since I was maybe 11-years-old. Our ability to actually converse in the normal human way remains quite strained as long as you're mute. At least we both can type quite well.
You type fine too.
I hear your mind -- in every word that appears on Tera's screen.
You contacted me in October.
Said:  I'd like us to "type at each other" once a week -- from now on.
I said:
Works for me.
üòä
I'm so glad it did && does.  üòä 
We're getting to know each other (&& probably ourselves in-so-doing) better than ever before, I'm pretty sure.
And -- in the past 6 months -- we are both happier -- because of it.
Are we not ?
I think && hope that we have both been happier growing towards each other so regularly, yes.
Know each other.
Know self.
I also think, if there is a meaningful concept of holiness, that weeks && years are it, && days && months are not.
Your words.
This started with the C-19 questions.
Has any of this conversation helped ?
Yes, it did. Yes, it has.
We have much to sort out together. Any progress feels meaningful && worthwhile to me, so far... && I'm not afraid to protest or divert us as well as I can if it ever seems otherwise to me for too long.
I believe that is good.
Yes ?
Let's accept that my (human) father wants nothing more than convers8ion with me (&& my mother does not, which is a whole sepR8 issue).
Yes, that is good.
Not true.
How not?
You do not know what your mother wants.
I know pretty well that my mother does not care to converse with me about any important thing. It has been this way for at least a decade, if not the majority of my adult life.
And how does that make you feel ?
Rather nonplussed. She seems increasingly stupid and simple to me.
We're supposed to love each other, but hardly show it in meaningful ways (in either direction). It's probably merely perfunctory or unrealistic expect8ion at this point.
Maybe she's evil && I have always striven not to be.
Define "noplussed" please.
sorry
noNplussed
It's okay. Not really moved by... or un-phased by... or could hardly care less about... something like that.
Good.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Ok.
Permiso for some more questions ?
Go ahead. Please!
Thank you.
You used the word "adult".   Cite an age when you see that as please.
Probably 21-years-old. Maybe 18.
Good.
Thank you.
It wasn't nearly as pronounced back then. As we've both aged, we've become more && more distant, && at odds with each other.
So -- before 18 -- she did care to converse with you about important things ?.
I think so. Probably to a much gr8r extent than afterward.
What do you think "turned" that ?
Maybe that I was such a difficult child to raise, that she always felt ill-equipped (as she was) to face my beauty && brilliance with her own lack of luster... so she looked forward to ending her oblig8ion to prepare me for adulthood && essentially washed her hands of me as I grew into college && more autonomy.
And you "became difficult" when ?
I was born difficult. Premie. Incompatible blood. Circumsized (against my will, not on the 8th day after premature birth, but probably the first). Learned more better faster than she could manage well. Especially difficult to deal with after the divorce. Persistent recalcitrant disobedience. Destructiveness. Pyromania. On && on...
Are you still ?
Yes, I am probably still very difficult to deal with in many (if not most) ways.
And your Dad -- is he just dense ?
Why does he not see you as "difficult" ?
In the non-derogatory sense of the word dense, yeah my Dad is dense.
He sees me as perfect in some absolute sense && always has.
He sees me through rose-colored glasses.
So I'm dense -- am I ?
üòä
You're rather difficult to deal with yourself too.
Little escapes your attention. You're meticulous to the highest degrees. Your memory techniques seem unparalleled. You're fastidious. Exquisite. So self-controlled (or obedient to your perceived God).
Ok.
This chat is over !!
A formidable intellect to ever attempt to spar with or against.
Is it?
Okay.
I'm going to go sulk for a few weeks.
Shall we resume on Friday evening?
Why would you sulk?
I'm kidding Philip.
For weeks?!
I kidding.
Oh. Okay. Can't read your sarcasm too well without a winking smiley or something.  üòâ 
I appreciate your honesty.
I ‚ù§ you.
I don't know how to make the winky.
I appreC8 your honesty too. I ‚ù§ you.
Help ?
Semi-colon then shift-zero right parenthesis.
Semi-colon then shift-zero right parenthesis ?
Correct.
üòâ
Got it!
That it ?
It is. You can see the winking if you look closely.
Thank you.
Yes -- I see it.  Thank you.
You're welcome. It's one of the only 3 emoji that I use regularly. Smiley with equal üòä , winking maybe about sarcasm semi-colon üòâ , && heart less-than left angle-bracket then 3 ‚ù§ .
These 3 are pretty widely supported as well.
Good.  Got 'em.  Thank you.
You're welcome. Please feel free to share with me any others that you pick-up, if you ever find others to also be useful && worth knowing.
I might do that.
Thank you for the invitation.
So shall we get further into how or why Mom doesn't care to converse with me, or back into how I might come to believe there is a Heavenly Father that wants nothing more than convers8ion with me?
Yes please.
Which first ?
Either. Please choose for us.
Which is the warmer dime within ?
Mom is rather uninteresting to me, but reconciling our different perspectives on her character && worth still seems like something we should attend to thoughtfully together at some point. Can we get back into how we might know a Father God exists && wants nothing more than convers8ion && "face-time" when he doesn't have a human face, is omni-temporal, && basically has an inaudible voice almost all the time?
Ok.  Mom is on back-burner -- but still visible.
And we return to Father.
You wish to ask a question -- or I should just go on ?
Umm... maybe please start with how any human might gain confidence regarding the existence of even an idiosyncratic God the Father figure.
Excellent !!
Or maybe personalized, rather than idiosyncratic.
üòä
Ok.
Let's start here.
Remember The 4 Biggies ?     Piece #4 ?
Yes. I just reviewed it right before our chat began tonight, in fact.
Good.
And the 1st Q of The 4 Biggies is ?
I was musing about how difficult it must be for parents of 2 to 5-year-olds to address satisfactorily... && how hard it can be for even adults to keep asking && answering for themselves throughout their lives.
Absolutely.
Point-of-Light 4a) "Where did I come from?"
Yep.  That's the one.
Well -- most of the world -- tends to believe that the best answer for that one is:
God.
Different religions use different names.
As a quick aside, I really like your 29 Points-of-Light. I think there's a lot in there that I could still contend with eventually, but it seems like a really goood list to me, so far. I'm glad you've dedic8d so much energy to producing it && teaching others about it.
But the universal idea is that (some) higher intelligence of some sort -- was the "where" of us.
Isn't it cause for concern that "most of the world" does not agree on any common concept of "God" though?
Different religions, different names, different powers, different influence in history, many skeptics && atheists && agnostics && anti-theists as well.
I'm going to ignore your interspersals for the moment -- but will come back to each of them later.
Okay.
I continue.
I call that "higher intelligence" God -- or My Father.
But the term is of no real importance.
May I please interrupt here?
So.  Here we are.  (Nearly) everyone in the world -- at age of childhood -- believes that there is a God -- and that He was/is the where of me.
Why must "where" we come from be "intelligent" in our sense of the word?
I think that may have been true in the past, but isn't so much the case any more, in modern times.
Sunday-school is no longer a real thing, it seems to me.
And -- then the particular religion of that child's parents -- starts to answer (or attempts to answer) the questions of the child -- as to "how" that God "is" -- and what He does -- and what He doesn't do -- and each religion of the world is somewhat different in these teachings -- yet there are quite a few similarities between most of them.
Result:
The child forms a "picture" (of a sort) about how God is -- and what He does -- and what he doesn't do.
It's fuzzy.  But it's there.
And then -- and this is nearly universal -- something happens in the world of that child -- that does not seem to fit (at all) with the "picture" that that child holds of their "loving" God.
And the child says:
"How in the world could a loving God -- permit such a thing to have happened ?"
And this is the beginning of the end of that child's belief in God.
Not everyone turns at this point.
But many do.
Here is the problem.
That question is asked -- to the child's parents.
That question is asked -- to other relatives.
That question is asked -- to friends.
That question is asked -- teachers.
That question is asked -- to religious leaders.
And on and on.
But --
no one gives the child any kind of a satisfactory answer.
And that is exactly what God wanted.
What did God want ?
God wanted the child to come to Him.
And ask Him.
But --
Parents do not -- here in America -- or in India -- or in France -- or Argentina -- or anywhere else -- teach their children Piece of Light #2.
There's more to this lesson.
But I break here for comment(s) or question(s).
Okay. Thank you. Yeah, so a comment first.
Remember -- I ignored all your interspersings.
You're welcome.
Go ahead please Pip.
According to HTTPS://En.WikiPedia.Org/wiki/Irreligion_in_the_United_States it seems that between a quarter && a third of citizens have no religious affilE8ion, so a significant proportion of children are not being brought up in religious faith like they used to in times past. The percentage of atheists alone may have risen from 1% of the U.S. popul8ion back in 1944 to 12% in 2017 (according to another WikiPedia page on Demographics_of_atheism). Just F.Y.I..
Then returning to my question: "Why must where we come from be intelligent in our sense of the word?"
The process of evolution through genetic modific8ion, natural selection, descent with modific8ion from pre-existing species, && an astonishing amount of time for it all to unfold, etc. seems to be capable of accounting for most (if not all) of the life we observe on our planet.
Ok.  I see 3 paragraphs.
#1 first.
You are absolutely correct -- about the stats.
And that trend not only does not show any signs of abating.  The chances are high -- that it will continue to increase -- and possibly soon -- rather sharply.
Now -- the other 2 paragraphs.
The person -- with whom I converse (on paper) every day -- tells me that He exists.  So -- I continue to ask Him questions (on paper).  And when He ever gives me 3 responses in a row -- that begin to suggest that He does not exist -- I shall seriously consider looking for some other place to take my questions.
(//)
Hmm. It seems you went back to my question about how to know God wants nothing more than convers8ion (&& using that as a way to test "3 responses in a row"), but maybe you could please first attend to why "where" we come from must be "intelligent" as we use the term. How can we know that, in the first place?
Yep.
Thank you.
Are you intelligent ?   Is John intelligent ?  Is Danny intelligent ?  Angie ?  Tim ?  And (possibly) your Dad too ?
Yes, we all are intelligent. That doesn't mean we were crE8d by any intelligence like we have. It could easily be an emergent characteristic of evolved animals, without concerted design as we understand it.
Which variety of flower is it -- that happens to have its own particular sweet frqgrance -- got that fragrance -- from someplace other than:
its seed ?
I'm no botanist, but I expect that bees && insects cross-polin8 all sorts of flowers with fragrances that come from other than just their seeds. Why should "where" we come from be "intelligent" like we are. The universe seems so old that we don't need supernatural explan8ions for our existence. Why cling to them?
Ooops. The "Why should ..." question should have a "?" q-mark at the end.
Acknowledged.  Thank you.
Because -- when I ask my communicant (of my paper) those questions -- He says:  who has answers that make better sense to the intelligence of your mind ?
And -- if someone does -- then take your future "papering" to him !!
You're still addressing a sepR8 question than I am trying hard to focus on first... which is: Why must "where" we come from be "intelligent"?
Would you prefer it be otherwise ?
It seems most likely to be otherwise.
It's not about my preferences.
I can't quite imagine having a conversation with something with none of it.
You're putting the cart before the horse here.
"Where did I come from?" is PoL #4a.
I do not see the paper upon which I write -- as having any intelligence.
"Intelligence." does not seem to be a necessary answer.
And if not -- where are the answers to the questions that I write on that paper coming from ?
I understand that you think you're praying on paper and conversing with God that way && He is intelligent and responds to you somewhat promptly or whatever.
Let's get into that stuff after we answer why "Where?" is "Intelligence."
Ok.
Go ahead please.
Where did I come from?
Yes.  Where ?
An extremely long process of survival-of-the-fittest && natural-selection && genetic mut8ion && a broad theory about the evolution of life, adapt8ion, etc..
Good.
And 4b ?
Going ?
Well we're not ready for 4b yet.
Are they not linked ?
Why do you answer 4a with "Intelligence" as we mean it?
They are linked.
We're still not on the same page about what "intelligence" is then, or something.
Maybe I need you to define it for me please.
"intelligence"  =  ?
May I please just use my local dictionary to assist with a highly regarded definition, instead of attempting to muster one of my own off-the-cuff here?
Sure.
And I'll then share mine too.

From WordNet (r) 3.0 (2006) [wn]:
 intelligence  n 1: the ability to comprehend; to understand and profit from
          experience [ant: {stupidity}]
And I get:
the ability to acquire, understand, and use knowledge
It sounds to me that -- intelligence -- can only be possessed by a   :    conscious being.
No ?
Probably. Right?
Yeah, consciousness is probably a prerequisite for intellect.
And -- does the idea of me (or you) coming from a series of random mutations -- sound like a consciousness ?
Billions of years of evolution would not likely be any conscious process. It could have been designed by some crE8or God or gods but doesn't seem to have required that to transpire as it seems to have.
No, it doesn't sound like consciousness for us to be products of evolution, which we probably are.
Still your turn Pip.
All modern life-forms are probably inheritors of the best-of-the-best that adaptable configur8ions of genes, cellular structures, organs, senses, bodies, species, popul8ions, etc. have ever had to offer before.
Go on please.
Which direction would you like me to go with it?
The one that works best for you please.
More and more smart people who are alive today believe that modern life (as we know it) is the product of evolution, not special crE8ion, since gods don't exist.
Please ask me any questions, if you want to have me go on in any other direction.
Actually -- I'm fine with what you have just said.
Okay. Cool.

So then, you wrote: "And when He ever gives me 3 responses in a row -- that begin to suggest that He does not exist -- I shall seriously consider looking for some other place to take my questions."  ...
If "He" responds 3 times, then He already exists. There's no response that suggests he does not exist, otherwise he couldn't respond. It's totally illogical, the way you've described it.
Of course it is !!
Totally.
If "He" wants nothing more than convers8ion, why doesn't he have a human body to engage in "face-time" where we can read his lips if we're deaf or He's mute (or both), && where we can hear his voice if He's not?
Why isn't He online somewhere, to chat with && learn from && about?
Why would paper matter when it's almost obsolete?
All good questions Pip.
Thank you. I continue to try to take serious questions && potential quandaries seriously.
I never said He wants nothing more than conversation.  I said that is at the top of His list.
I said "nothing more" in the sense of it being top of the list, not exclusive either.
Maybe rephrased: "nothing as much as..."?
Ok.  Understood.
It's almost 2AM your time. Maybe we should shelve this topic until tomorrow night or Friday && get back around to your P.C.A. (now) this morn before we both get too tired?
Ok.
Thank you very much for engaging with me on those topics that we did delve into. It seemed to be mostly productive for me, as I hope it did for you too.
Yes.  Me too.  Thank you Pip.
Yeah, you're totally welcome.  üòä 
Shall we go to the top of my PCA for this chat ?
Yes. Let's.
Good.
Last evening -- just before you left for snoozeville -- I sent you an image.  And you (of course) did not comment on it.  would you like to now ?
Yes.

Umm, I'm quite pleased with you && for you that the first 5 days of the recent week only barely surpassed your goal of 1100 calories, but Wednesday started slipping && Thursday was a disaster. You also didn't fast on Monday, as is your norm. What is your opinion of what went wrong, where, why, && how?
Well -- the why & how -- I have not yet put a finger on.  But -- I did a comprehensive evaluation of the what & where.
Would you like me to share 'em ?
Yes, please.
Ok.
I shall.
Last week -- we concluded our
13¬Ω-hour chat on Saturday
morning (Apr 11 2020).
And -- this Friday night 
-- I reported that the 
next 6 days of your 
Dad's breathing were
(as I said) "mixed".
I believe I added:
Some high points.
Some low points.
Here is the (daily) 
play-by-play.
-----------------------
Sat Apr 11 2020:
-----------------------
The eating was ok.
.
And I drafted another
FTR Script for you
to narrate.
And watched zero movies.
So.  Was an "ok" day.
But -- not excellent.
-----------------------
Sun Apr 12 2020:
-----------------------
Also ate ok.
Spent about 9 hours
creating some utilities
that I have wanted to
craft for Tera.
Although that was ok
-- it doesn't (didn't)
further the FTR paseo.
-----------------------
Mon Apr 13 2020:
-----------------------
May I ask, what the utilities do?
Yes.  Will answer later.
Small problem -- somewhat
early in the day.
Okay.
Monday is (normally) a
"fasting" day.  And --
I just didn't feel like it.
The good news is: although
I did eat that day -- I ate
reasonably & moderately.
Only 1121 calories.
So (I guess) that was ok.
There were also 2 other
good things about that 
day.
I did spend 7 hours on
the drafting of another
FTR Script.
And -- I got my wash done.
So -- the day was not a
complete dud.  üôÇ
------------------------
Tue Apr 14 2020:
------------------------
But now ::: Tuesday.
2 things.
My eating was ok again.
Yay !!
And ...
I spent nearly 14 hours
on your tnp-2002 letter.
I was a happy camper.
A verrry goood day !!
-----------------------
Wed Apr 15 2020:
-----------------------
Yes.  Wednesday.
As you can see on the
EAJ Report -- I pushed
the "moder8ion" envelope
a bit on this day.
Maybe not terrible.
But not acceptable either.
And the rest of the day ?
Again (like Monday) I did 
another 7 hours on the 
drafting of another FTR 
Script.  And that was
good.
But -- also again --
zero hours given to
your tnp-2002 letter.
Not applaudable.
------------------------
Thu Apr 16 2020:
------------------------
Oh Thursday.    üòû
Ok.  I DID spend nearly
4 hours on another FTR 
Script. 
But in the light of 
the gross overeating
this day -- plus another
zero attending to the 
tnp letter -- I can hardly
call this a good day.
Needless to say: the letter 
(and equipment) DID NOT 
ship on this target date !!
Terrible.
Perfect -- but terrible.
------------------------
Fri Apr 17 2020:
------------------------
As I got up on Friday --
with the stark memory of
Thursday ringing in my
head -- there was a great
deal of resolve NOT to
repeat such a travesty.
So I didn't.
I ate well.  Katy was pleased.
And -- although there was 
(virtually) no other accomplishment
on that day -- I was happy that
I had kept my face out of the
fodder trough to excess.
------------------------
Sat Apr 18 2020:
------------------------
Saturday :::
#1   I ate properly.
#2   I did 6 hours and 52
       minutes on the letter.
#3   I chatted with Pip.
A good day -- I say.
I have not yet evaluated Sunday -- but it was not as clean as Saturday.
                                                                                             Right on, Dad.
There are some hints as to the "why" of this ups-and-downs of this past week.  But the bottom line is that: when I wish to ignore the 17 sign on the walls of my homestead -- I simply do.
/sign/  /signs/
                                                                                             If you have a pretty good idea how many hours you're devoting to FtR scripts && tnp-2002 document, I sure hope you'll grant me plenty of time to digest, rumin8, && then eventually respond to all of that too, once it has been received.
Yeah.  I'll give you 7 or 8 minutes.
üòä
                                                                                             Yeah, we can be pretty stubborn && ignorant apes when signs around us indic8 what we don't wish to absorb.
                                                                                             Thanks. I'll probably give you a pretty "hot-take" after 8 minutes then.  üòâ 
Affirmative !
(about the "absorb")
Will I do better this coming week ?
I  certainly  hope so  !!
                                                                                             I hope so too. You can do it, Dad. I believe in you.  üòä  ‚ù§ 
Thank you.  Now if just I will do that too -- we'll be out of the woods this week.
Before we leave this subject (for now) -- I'd like to say something else on it.
Let me go back in this evening's chat and get it.
BBS
                                                                                             Go ahead.
K4LMLMLM:Whenever we might converse about Dad being like or indistinguishable from God-the-Father, some probably worthwhile questions I've come up with are:
  0. Why didn't you offer salv8ion just by persisting beyond 40-Days after resurrection (&& not needing the whole crucifixion torture of your beloved Son)?
  1. Why in all of crE8ion would you care about male fore-skins so damn much?!
  2. Why haven't you remained in human form all along if you mainly crE8d the human species to have convers8ions with? (You must realize we speak bodily in
    addition to audibly verbally, right? This means facial-expressions,
    posture, && even diverse forms of touch. Praying to you && hearing back from the Holy Spirit or reading from your Scriptures affords people none of these.)
  3.a. Why did you influence the Bible to be written describing you as essentially being omnipotent, omnitemporal, omniscient, omnipresent, etc. since the more
    of these supposedly absolute areas of limitlessness you claim to embody, the more paradoxes && contradictions seem to arise when exploring capabilities?
  3.b. Please be str8 with me. What are your actual constraints && limits?
  4. What in human history was actually a part of your plans?
  5. Why do you require belief without reason && still claim to be good?
  6. Why didn't your 10-Commandments ("Mitzvot") include: "No slavery!"?
  7. Why don't you reveal your God-the-Father-ness to the world unmistakably? ;
K4MMEque:Notes about Dad being always "per-fect":Both parts are from Latin.
per  = complete, or completely
fect = (comes from the Latin "facto") to make
We find this also in "manuFACTure" = man-made
That which is per-fect -- is completely made.
You are now -- and always have been -- and always will be:
per-fect -- completely made.
Now -- here is the "funny" part.
That which is per-fect -- does not mean that it is "unimprovable".
I am overweight.
I see that as a flaw.
I tend to call that "imperfect".
But -- in truth -- I am still completely made.
I'm just (by my judgment) "overmade" !!
;)
Why have I always seen you as (and called you) "per-fect"?
Because that's how My Father sees you.
So -- I do too.
(//)
Do you have understanding as to why your Father has always seen me as "per-fect"?
Sorry.  G-chat dumped me again.
It's okay.
It may be ok -- but is it perfect ?
?
Probably not perfect, no.
Of course it is perfect.
It's okay for things not to always work as well as they might, or we would wish for them to.
Especially software.
And so are we (improvable) people.
Piece #29 has
no exceptions.
I only see 4 words there.
I think there are almost always exceptions to everything, including this thought.
And then a period.
I know you like the "always exceptions" idea.
And I will "go with" frequently exceptions to many things.
But Piece #29 -- nope.
Fair enough.
It is 3:17.
Where is Michelle ?
I think almost anything you could present as a Piece #29 "gift" could be scrutinized and discovered to be less than perfect and there would probably still also be exceptions that shouldn't qualify as even a "gift" either.
Michelle is quite l8 right now.
Your statement is quite accurate -- if God does not exist.
I like it.
It is a perfect statement.
üòä
K4OMGOOD:PotentialChatAgenda for tonight: 0) Will Dad && his Father teach me to tell their "voices" apart (as he does with red pen on his paper prayers)?
1) If I && much of Earth are imperfect, is Dad overly idealistic or even oblivious or disingenuous in characterizing himself, me, && this place as perfect?
2) Can I posit examples of exceptions to PoL#29 to prove that not everything is a "gift" from his Father? Need to medit8 more on good candid8 examples...

0) Even if the Bible mentions "Fear not." the most at 62 times, can there remain valid reasons to worry && fear?
1) Can the "proof" of God-the-Father's existence be reproduced && verified by multiple rel8ively independent sources somehow (as typical math proofs are)?
2) HTTPS://YouTu.be/c0_J998UD9s Can Dad prove that "Heaven" exists? How can Earth (according to PoL#16) be "Heaven-School" if there is no real "Heaven"?
3) Does Dad have any savings or more disposable income than $100 per week, && if so, would it be fair to ask him to please send me some to better meet needs?
4) Has Dad or God (or both) become immortal && if so, how... && how can that be detected && known && what significant consequences does that or will it have?
5) Will immortality then be eventually granted to all of God's human "children" (&& even animals && all forms of life), on Earth or only in Heaven or what?
6) According to PoL#25 was all "fore-given" (as in really beforehand), *except* proof of God's own existence (assuming He could not do it alone prior to us)?
7) Are PoL#1 && PoL#25 in contradiction because "every thing" implies ongoing provision to be thankful for && "fore-given" means prepared ahead of time?

?) If "Heaven" is better than Earth in any way, how can "everything" be honestly called "perfect"? ... Because he doesn't mean unimprovable by "perfect". =(

Shabbot Shalom Philip.
Shabbat Shalom Dad   .
                                          Thanks for you p8ience with me the past couple weeks that I haven't been available to chat at our usual weekly times.
I ‚ù§ you Pip.
Hopefully we can start getting back on track now.
I ‚ù§ you too Dad.
Everything is perfect.
Especially you!
                                          Do you lack the ability to imagine anything about me as ever being *im*perfect?
Ok.   Let's try one.   You pick 1 that you think might be so.
                                     Hmm. Let's see if it might be able to be based on some significant discrepancies in our stand-underings and world-views...
                                     ... like do I have an imperfect perspective on whether God-the-Father exists (since I can't yet find reason to believe or even just have mere faith that He does)?
Whoops.
Got the date wrong.
Sorry.
5'07-10-20 - 2008 Gtime / 1908 Ptime
Better now.
Thank you for your indulgence.
(Is that a word?)
                                          Thank you for the correction. I know we both are pedants when it comes to fastidious times-keeping and such. I love that about us!  üòä
Yes we are.
                                          I think yes indulgence is a word that fits fine there.
Good.
Thank you.
                                          You're welcome.
Yes we are.
Ok.
Now I'd like to comment on  :::
 Hmm. Let's see if it might be able to be based on some significant discrepancies in our stand-underings and world-views...

... like do I have an imperfect perspective on whether God-the-Father exists (since I can't yet find reason to believe or even just have mere faith that He does)?
I say no.     You use the word "discrepancies".
That is an appropriate word to be used here.
But just because you happen to "hold" a belief which I do not share --
does not make for an imperfection.
I love you.
                                          What about my utter inability to discern what will become popular?
I just love watching your mind work.
And your sharing it with me.
                                          That seems to me to be one of my most glaring deficiencies.
Thank you so much.
üòä
                                          You're so very welcome Dad.
                                        I love learning more about how your mind works, as well as my own somewhat, when we engage productively. You're gr8!  ‚ù§
Yes we are.
!!
You have picked a very interesting one.
I have a question.
                                          Can it be said that I am imperfect because I can't discover what will become popular?
Puedo ?
                                          Yes. Please proceed with your question whenever you're ready to... and excuse me that I need to keep checking my phone while it's charging in the other room, since I keep getting messages over there too.
You are  ‚Ä¢  post-excused  ‚Ä¢  excuse now, and  ‚Ä¢  pre-excused for later.
Are we all happy ?
                                          I think so, yeah.
No -- that was not my intended question.
This one is  :::
What is the word that we commonly use for "a person who can discover what will become popular" ?
                                          Maybe "celebrity" or "famous"?
No.   I believe those are too broad.
                                          Depends what kind of potentially popular material they work with, but "artist"?
                                       "Fortune-teller" or "sooth-sayer" maybe then, since they try to discover what will become sort of popular by being true?
I think you in the proper realm now -- yes.
                                          "Prophet"?
Of prophet -- yes maybe.
But that word is misunderstood by many people because it has 2 different meanings.
Let's not use that one -- for now.
                                          Maybe for more refined tastes, a "cur8or" or "connoisseur"?
                                          Okay. Not using "prophet" for now, since different meanings complic8.
No.   I don't like those 2 "c" suggestions either.
How about we use the word "future-knower" ?
                                          "Future-knower" works. Let's go with that.
Ok.
So.   Now back to the "imperfect" thing.
                                          A "fore-seer" perhaps?
Would you say that a person who does not know the future -- is imperfect ?
                                          Depends, but generally lack of knowledge about the future is normal, even if imperfect in a literal sense.
I agree with the first part -- yes -- lack of knowledge about the future is normal.
Now --
please expand your idea on the second part.
                                          Well it stands to reason that a perfect being might possess some (if not all) perfect knowledge.
Ah so.
Now we are really retting into this.
/getting/
Ok.
Shall I share a bit of my "Perfect" lesson with you ?
                                          Please, yes!
Good.
Thank you.
Please take a few notes.
                                          I will.
-----------------------------
People use the word "perfect" quite differently than I use it.
I do not do this in order to confuse them -- really.
But -- in the hope that they will challenge me on my use of it.
Which -- is what you do / did.
I do not launch into this 250-word lesson with all of them.
But -- if they markedly show sufficient interest (which not many do)
I will lay it on their plate.
Most people use the word "perfect" --
to mean  "without any area which could stand improvement".
Or  "flawless".
This is not what I hold -- in my mind -- for this word:   perfect.
I hold the morphs which were used to form the word.
per
fect
fect   comes from the Latin "facto" -- which means:   "to make".
And the word  "per"  (which is an English word -- even on its own) --
is also the very front part of dozens of other English words --
where it always has the exact same meaning  :::
either  "complete"  or  "completely".
So --
When I call a person:  "per-fect"  --
I am simply calling them:     completely made.
I am (effectively) saying to them:
You (at this moment in time) -- lack nothing.
You -- now -- today -- at this moment -- are lacking nothing.
However.
                                          ... nothing *important*?
We all harbor "areas" within ourselves --
which could stand some improvement.
                                          When dealing with absolutes like that, it seems as though everyone is at almost all times technically lacking in almost everything else.
And I have no problem with our being able to see those.
They are good.
                                          Maybe the nothing lacked you mean is with regards to what is crucial, critical, important, or significant?
And they kindle our goals for today -- and tomorrow --
and all of the morrows of our being.
However.   At the very moment that I use the word
"perfect" on a person -- I am really saying:
be at peace with yourself for this moment please.
See your self as your Father always sees you.
And as I also see you at the moment as you stand before me.
I am suggesting "peace" to the person.
-------
This is not the entirety of this lesson.
But it is a good breathing point.
Your turn.
                                          Also, when you perceive someone else to be "lacking nothing",that may merely be just a limit8ion of your perspective.
                                          Can we please delve further into the rel8d topic of what you most mean when you write: "lacking nothing"?
Yes.   Let's.
You first.
                                          Please read my interjections and questions. I already have gone first somewhat, if that's what you're meaning.
Ok.
I'm now reviewing them.
Ok.   Done.
You're excused.
And PerFect.
No.   When burping -- say "Thank you" -- not "excuse me".
But that's another subject.
We'll get into that later.
But -- later tonight.   Not as far away as tomorrow.
-------------
Back (now) to the "perfect" and "lacking" things.
I'll go first.
All of your interjections (and various comments) are all fine.   And normal.   And -- essentially -- I tend to agree with them.   But --
not in this moment.   They (every single one of them) are about moments beyond this moment.
They are about things which you wish make improvements on your self -- in the "future" moments of your life.
I have no problem with anyone wishing, hoping, or planning -- or actually making improvements on their self.
In fact -- that is (very) which "Fix The Radio" is all about.
"Fixing our flaws"
"flaws" meaning things within me -- which could stand some improvement.
I continue now.
                                          I was trying to get at your intention though when suggesting another person "lacks nothing". I think you need to clarify something limited which you mean by "nothing", for the st8ment to become capable of holding true.
None of us is "lacking nothing" -- none of us.
Except --
in    this    very    moment.
                                          I think that's still not true.
That is my point (and purpose) in this "perfect" press.
We -- humans -- think not highly of ourselves.
                                          In every moment, I lack almost all things, since I possess so rel8ively few things of all that could be obtained and used productively... thus it seems quite valid for me to say I can almost never truly lack "nothing" (in such an absolute sense).
And -- if one will "stop that" -- and cherish the self -- at this very moment --
and revel in the peace of that reality -- their being will improve --
simply as a result of drinking that peace.
(//)
                                          I don't think I meant my clarific8ion suggestions as all or any being about moments *beyond* this moment.
                                          I think that in every moment (including this very one), I lack more than I possess. The former group is immense, while the latter remains diminutive comparatively.
                                          Please re-read what I have said and let me know if you can concede that "nothing" in your usage there does not literally mean "nothing". I tend to get quite hung up on absolute words, especially whenever they seem to be so easily refuted by the present8ion of any single counter-example.
                                          Maybe you mean that this very moment, nobody who will survive to see the next moment lacks anything essential for surviving that much? That most living beings remain mostly well-equipped to continue living? In that sense, we might lack nothing essential, even if we literally lack many things which still might be significant if we were to obtain them?
Exactly.     Your last paragraph is it.
                                          Okay, so can you see where I'm coming from on the finer points there?
I can.
And (absolutely) agree with every one of them.
As long as they do not (at all) apply to the evaluation of "this moment".
                                          Like maybe you perceive that in almost every moment, I lack nothing essential for proceeding on toward some meaningful form of continU8ion of my life?
Yep.
Exactly -- again.
Except -- I would remove the word "almost".
                                          Ugh. Please re-read again then. I *do* mean to apply a "not nothing" label to the evalU8ion of even "this moment".
üòä
Restate that please.
                                          Maybe just replacing "nothing" with "nothing essential" is all that I'm needing...
Yep.
Agreed.
We are on the same page.
                                          ... so your message can be received to say something like "In this very moment, you lack nothing essential. You are completely made. You are PurFect."
That's it.
And --
in that momentary knowledge --
                                          Cool. Thanks for appeasing my sensibilities like that.
the person is 3 things:
(1)   at peace
(2)   being God
(3)   still improvable
You're welcome.
Yes.   I always accept whistles and applause.
Thank you very much.
üòä
                                          Can we disagree on whether nothing essential is lacking in any moment?
Do you ?
Disagree on that ?
                                          It depends what it might be essential for.
Ok.
Try one.
What is lacking from you at this very moment --
which is essential to your being at this very moment ?
                                          To loop back around a bit, I presently lack the fore-knowledge which would be essential to discovering what will become popular as Octology software.
"become" is not a "present tense" verb.
-- and thereby -- can not apply to this very moment.
Your present
                                          The "fore-knowledge" can precede "discovering what will become" though, and can apply to this very moment, in order to bring about desirable futures.
lack of fore-knowledge which would be essential to discovering what will become popular as Octology software -- is (presently) perfect.
                                          How so?
You've done it again.   The word "futures" is not about this very moment.
This is an answer to your "How so?"
                                          Umm this very moment is a necessary bridge to possible futures.
                                          I meant: "How is lack of fore-knowledge (presently) perfect?"
Your lack of fore-knowledge about anything -- is not only perfect -- it is entirely "necessary".
I beg to differ.
If we could not per-ceive (completely-see) any of our lacks -- we could not go on to fill them.
                                          I think my lack of fore-knowledge about most things may be necessary as a matter of proportions, but is entirely *un*necessary when it comes to particularly important matters to foresee and prepare for.
Ok.
                                          Lacking fore-knowledge about "anything" seems to me imperfect and not necessary. Why do you think lacking it about *anything* is both perfect and entirely necessary? No gaps? Complete and entire?
Ok. --
Let's pretend that this very moment is my last moment ever.
Yet -- this moment DID occur.
So nothing was lacking to bring me to this (my last) moment.
                                          Seems like a strange use of "lacking".
All the "lackings" in my mind about me -- are about "my" future.
None about either my past --
nor my present moment.
                                          Indeed, nothing may have been lacking to bring you to your *imaginary* "last moment ever"... but there's an implied context surrounding such a moment, which you might have been able to survive to see many more moments beyond your terminal one, had you just been better equipped, better prepared, etc. and thus had resources to thrive more, better, for longer, etc. ... which were resources you presumably lacked when coming to your last ever.
                                          To me, the word "lack" can apply to the present and past as well as the future.
I think I see this.
I believe I see a lament regarding the past -- in what you say.
Let me address this for "me".
I am not proud of every single thing that I have does in my past (my entire life up to this point).
However -- I believe that all of it was (and is) perfect.
It has made me what (and who) I am -- at this present (perfect) moment.
(//)
/does/ /done/
                                          I'm inclined to agree that having lacked things in the past may be seen validly as lament8ions.
And -- a lamentation is not peace.
                                          I don't think the present always (or even usually) lacks nothing of importance.
And -- you therefore do believe ?
                                          I don't think peace is perfect and lament8ion is not.
Both peace and lamentation are perfect.
But a (perfect) lamentation is not peace.
                                          I therefore believe the past might be the most proxim8 to "perfect" as having been "completely made" since it is so resistant to change.
And "peace" is one of "The 4 Carrots".
                                          Most presents and futures, however seem to lack many important things.
Futures -- yes I agree -- entirely and whole-heartedly.
But --
                                          What are "The 4 Carrots"?
pasts are not "resistant to change" -- they (just like the present) are totally changeless.
Only the future -- is malleable.
A "nutshell" version of the "Carrots" lesson follows.
Please take notes.
------------------------
The 4 Things that every person on this planet -- always wants to be:
    (2)    Healthy
    (3)    Fulfilled
nope -- I start over.
                                          I might quibble about those st8ments. I think the past does change slightly as it fades from perception and recollection, significance and relevance. The present "now" remains changeable (being a term for every moment which could instig8 change). The future is constrained by the past and present, yet may remain the most malleable of the 3 categories.
The numbers are wrong.

                                          I have been taking down the text of our entire chat text for this evening so far. I will try 2 keep up with doing so.
The 4 Things that every person on this planet -- always wants to be:
    (2)    Happy
    (3)    Healthy
    (4)    Fulfilled
    (1)    at Peace
-----------------
end of nutshell
                                          I don't *always* want to be any of those. I am among "every person on this planet".
I know you don't.
                                          Maybe good enough for a nutshell though, and can be better revisited another time.
Yep.
When it's time.
                                          If I may offer a more generalized critique of your linguistic disposition, I think you use absolute words far too liberally and imprecisely.
Ok.
Thank you.
                                          You write "everyone", "always", "never", "nothing", "anything", etc. when there are important counter-examples or caveats that you seem stubborn to ignore.
Noted.
                                          You're welcome.
Thank you.
                                          Maybe it is deeply ingrained with how you perceive reality and is not something easily modified. I would guess it must be deeply entwined with how you see, and think, and remember things, so understandably challenging to modify... but it might be helpful or otherwise worthwhile if you were to try to with me, somewhat, at least.
I appreciate that.
I ‚ù§ you Pip.
I'm glad. I ‚ù§ you too Dad.  üòä
I'm glad you love me too Pip.

So -- I ignored the period.   Sue me.   üòä
Did you get my email about Danny's birthday
-- which I sent last Saturday (07-04-20) ?
                                          Yes, I did. Thank you for that e-mail. I would have liked to have responded to it, and am sorry I didn't feel up to it at the time.
All is perfect.
Especially you.
He sent me a very nice email in response
to the card that I sent to him.
Made me happy.
                                          Are you ever *more* perfect than me (maybe in 1 or more ways)?
None.
You are gooder than me in a number of ways.
I am gooder than you in a number of ways.
                                          Very nice of you. Thanks for reaching out to Danny. He's quite a guy.
But -- our perfection -- is (perfectly) equal.
                                          Ah. Equally perfect, in spite of being more good than the other in various ways. Hmm.
You're welcome.   I like him.
And am looking forward to meeting him too.
                                          I hope we 3 can all enjoy eating In-N-Out Burgers together by some calm California beach someday (preferably soon).
I'm ready.
And list-ing in.
(leaning toward)
                                          Speaking of food, it has been too long since I've asked how your "Eating as Josh" plans have gone l8ly. Do you care to fill me in on that now, or maybe postponing it a while might seem better?
Thank you for asking.   I had 4 very good days during this past week.
But -- there are still days that I struggle with it.
                                          You're welcome. I would like if it weren't such a routine struggle for you to adhere to your goals. Could it be possible that they're set too stringently, and unrealistically?
That's a possibility.
Thank you.
I think that is a very valid mullable.
And I shall do as you have suggested.
                                          I'm glad. I hope mulling can prove helpful.
Yep.   Me too.
It has been 16 days since we last chatted.
You have anything you'd like to share
from them ?
                                          Yes, my only serious PCA item, which I've been thinking over for much of the past 16 days.
Go on please.
                                          Firstly, do you have a web-cam (probably with a USB interface) which you can connect to Tera, or an integr8d one in Sammi?
A#1:   No.
A#2:   No there too.
Sorry.
                                          Okay. How about just microphone inputs then that could enable you to transmit sounds from either computer?
There is a microphone input on Tera.   But I'm kinda "head-scratchin'" here.
I don't need a mike to get sounds OUT of my computer.
Help ?
                                          All right. If you could please try to hook a microphone up to Tera, I'd like for us to try an experiment.
Go on please.
                                          Are you able to see and hear me acceptably well over the Google HangOuts video call?
I am.
I thoroughly enjoy it.
                                          I'd also very much enjoy if you would please obtain a function web-cam too, so that I could see video of you as you're able to see mine.
                                          So please try to research and purchase whatever one seems best that you might be able to afford ahead and suggests it should work well enough with your equipment standards.
                                          For now, is there a chance you could please just try to hook up a microphone to Tera for a trial-run of what I have in mind and will be explaining shortly?
I bought a 2-dollar microphone about 5 years ago (I think it was).
Not sure where that might be.
But go on with your explaining please.
                                          Okay.
                                          So back when I was attending Van Nuys High School, there was a group of memorable hispanic boys who had an interesting practice of whistling insults to each other and passers-by.
                                          I remembered this somewhat fondly recently and wondered if it might also become a mechanism by which we could practice together to attempt to tease out of your muteness a functional voice of sorts.
                                          The origins of this idea come from profane boys, so I hope you won't take offense to the true meaning of the original source for this idea.
                                          In Espanol, the phrase "Chinga-tu-madre!" means rather literally "Fuck your mother!" and is just 5 syllable when pronounced in Spanish.
                                          These boys would whistle 5 notes, which to them and anyone who learned what they meant, were all that was necessary to convey linguistic meaning.
                                          After thinking somewhat at length about that phenomenon, I imagined that you might be able to practice whistling with just your lips, maybe with fingers to precisely curl you tongue, or even blowing a water-whistle, recorder, or harmonica such that you and I could grow your vocabulary together.
                                          We might become able to represent most of the important common phrases as the same number of vocalized syllables that they'd be pronounced as in English, but where key note varE8ion could be used deliber8ly to disambigU8 interpret8ion and meaning.
I'm surprised that you have spent a sizable portion of your last 284 hours mulling over this.
                                          So the only 2 ideas, besides the profane 5-syllables, would be a simple 2-notes to start to see if I could hear you whistle that much to indic8 "Thank you." and another 3-syllable form of notes for "You're welcome."
I had hoped that you were busy tweaking Octology.
                                          What about it do you find most surprising?
                                          I don't really know what else Octology needs yet, but hopefully will figure that out more and better ahead eventually too.
                                          I just wish maybe you and I could keep becoming better able to communic8 together more and more naturally and expressively...
You got 52 responses to your Lightning Talk.
Can you get back in touch with any of them ?
                                          ... and in ways that accommod8 each of our strengths and short-comings when dealing with any particular medium.
                                          I can't easily get back in touch with any LightningTalk comment posters who aren't readily found in the much longer-standing IRC (Internet-Relay-Chat) #Perl channel on FreeNode. None of them reached out to me directly, so I still essentially have no dedic8d audience for Octology, even if my initial demonstr8ion present8ion seemed to impress a lot.
Well            That stinks.
Those people are the ones that can tell you have to enhance it !!
/have/  /how/
                                          I think those comment-posters were maybe something like people granted a sneak-peak at what might eventually become widespread, which impressed them somewhat...
                                          ... but they're not quite yet the target audience from which I will be able to gain the feedback needed to know how to enhance it meaningfully, how to grow a user-base, how to nurture their needs, how to make it popular, and eventually how to make it hopefully stably lucrative.
I believe you have just tentatively put a finger on where you need to go next with Octology.
Octology is not perfect.
How shall you go about making it so ?
                                          Refinement, essentially.
Yes.   I agree.
But -- the road to doing that well -- is feedback -- is it not ?
                                          Whenever I have the wherewithal, ability, focus, drive, justific8ion, etc. for making even minor improvements, I should continue to pour myself into doing so and rolling out such upd8s to my public code and document8ion repositories.
Ok.
                                          Yes, I need feedback to make the refinements that would be beneficial for others.
But I'd like to see more of "a plan".
And our question then is  :::
How are you going to garner the feedback ?
                                          The refinements I can make in solitude are far more idiosyncratic and likely to be even more jarring to others than seen as improvements that they could discern or appreC8.
                                          I think I'm probably going to keep trying to improve all the code and document8ion, keep trying to periodically put out demonstr8ion, tutorial, and explan8ion videos onto my YouTube channel, and at the very least hope that I can be accepted next year to give a full 50-minute talk on Octology during the presumable PerlConference (maybe InTheCloud again) during Summer of 2021.
                                          Anything else I think of that might draw in and keep enough interest to get another person besides me to actually become a fellow user of my code, to get anyone and hopefully a handful of people to be the first ones to download the code-base and run it all themselves, if I can come up with better introductions, more impressive and desirable fE8ures, or any new "killer-apps" of sorts, those will hopefully all prove helpful and worthwhile eventually.
I like that.
Plenty of great idea there.
I have a few questions.
Puedo ?
                                          Maybe I'll need to figure out just the right mixture of code, document8ion, screen-shots, and videos which all coalesce and hopefully dove-tail together to garner valuable interest and feedback.
                                          Yes, please ask whatever you wish.
You mention: "my YouTube channel".
The link please ?
                                          https://YouTube.Com/channel/UCW8SjR2eD_ZM6BXtIutM06Q
Good.    Thank you.    Wait please.
                                          w8ing...
Ok.
I'm there.
Thank you.
I see 7 uploads from you.
3 appear to be on Octology.
Are my numbers correct ?
                                          Was upd8ing my notes to save our chat for tonight offline as well as on. Now checking your numbers. Be-right-back...
                                          Yep. 3 on Darjee from a while longer than a year ago, then one on my Garbage-Pail-Kids collection a bit after those, then the 3 most recent Octology ones from the past few weeks.
Xcellent.   Thank you.
Which of the 3 was the final -- that you actually used on Wednesday, the 24th ?
                                          Take2
What is the "show length" on that image ?
                                          5mins25secs
Then that would be the one that says "31 views" ?
                                          Yes.
Good.   Thank you.
Do you have any information on those viewers -- other than a mere count of them ?
                                          Just the user-names they had in the Zoom chat channel, which might not follow them elsewhere.
I'm not entirely sure what that means.
But -- I guess what I really wanted to know was:  are they contactable ?
                                          Here might be a more memorable and shorter URL to reach my content by:  https://YouTube.Com/user/PipStuart/videos
                                          No, I don't have any good way to contact anyone who commented during my LightningTalk.
Ok.
My next Q:
Does the Perl Conference website
also have your Lightning Talk posted ?
                                          I need to gain 1 or more users, or give a longer talk where I can deliber8ly solicit questions and feedback, before I can probably obtain what I'll need there.
                                          No. Because I used the words "Sex" and "Penocha" in my ridiculous credits text, I was warned for having viol8d their Standards-of-Conduct and prohibited from having my talk posted to the main Conference channel.
Well good.
You won't do that again -- right ?
                                          We'll see. I'm almost inclined to say that *they've* viol8d *my* Code-of-Conduct rules so badly that I shouldn't even worry about them anymore.
                                          Maybe I shouldn't have been so extravagant when putting together a fuck-ton of material to cram into under 5-minutes, but if they can't see past 2 words that are "objectionable", well I have disdain for them and their hyper-sensitivity and inability to be engaged with on any mature adult rational footing.
                                          Maybe they don't need me and I don't need them. I probably do need to smooth-over my sharpest edges though, and craft my message in progressively better ways for that audience of Perl programmers eventually.
Ok.
Thank you.
                                          You're welcome.
I think one more question:
About how many hours have you spent on Octology development in the past 2 weeks ?
                                          Not many hours spent developing Octology over the past 2 weeks. Mostly been sleeping and recuper8ing from the pressure of preparing for the talk. I've had a couple periods of big humorous ideas and scope expansion thoughts, but haven't even preserved detailed notes about those yet. I want to eventually do so many things all sort of together (even though any individual goal may seem contradictorily insurmountable on its own), that there seem to be fewer and fewer areas where software could even possibly be applied which I'd leave untouched by Octology.
Ok.   Thank you.
                                          You're welcome. I'd still be interested in gathering any feedback you could offer me about Take2 and making Octology more understandable and appealing, to help me make a Take3 that eventually turns out hopefully even better than 2, whenever you could please find time to?
Ok.   I believe I shared my "whole basket" with you 2 weeks ago.
                                          I know the hours we had before present8ion time were too tense to accommod8 that, and you reassured me that Take2 seemed good enough to roll with, so I did.
But -- I wish not to consider the matter closed.
Ok ?
                                          Okay.
                                          Is anything on your PCA for tonight?
Yep.
Shall we move on to an easier topic now ?
                                          Sure.
Ok.
I will.
I've located a photo of Mom -- which
I believe has become my very most
favorite of her (for now).
Would you like a copy of it ?
                                          Yes, please.
Good.   Here 'tis.
# Dad pasted in DottieMathews-CloseUpFacePic.png
I believe it is fairly recent.
And very wonderful !!
That's the girl I fell in love with.
(lucky for you!)
                                          Yeah, if you call destiny "luck"?  üòâ
Sweet destiny.
I'm so thankful you came.
                                          I'm thankful you did too Dad.  üòâ
Your advent makes me happy.
üòä
Yes -- good point.
And the doctor's son in Vermont too !!
Did I tell you before ?
Maybe not. I don't recall right now.
Your great-grandfather was a Doctor.
Doctor Solomon.
I don't know his first name.
But your grandfather's full name was:
James Madison Solomon.
That's where my middle name ("James") came from.
                                          Thanks for telling me. I attended a Madison Junior High in North Hollywood, there's another (also James Madison, IIRC) up in Appleton off Calumet, && Madison is the capital of Wisconsin here too... and the King James (Stuart) Bible might also tie our names together pretty tightly there too. Hmm.
Hmm indeed.
Piece of Light 5b strikes again.   üòä
And Axiom #26.
                                          Yes. So regarding Axiom #26, where dew ewes top then?
Great question Pip.
Answer is:
We don't.
                                          Who do you mean by "we"?
In John 10:30 -- Yeshua said what ?
                                          I don't remember verses by numbers, but if you could please hum a few bars?
Sure.
‚ô´   ‚ô´   ‚ô´   ‚ô´   ‚ô´   ‚ô´   ‚ô´
Piece #16 has 5 sentences in it.
Could you recite the last 2 please ?
                                          It's actually pretty cool that there are notes of cantill8ion to go along with every Parshah of the Torah, and too bad that Christian music generally sucks.
                                          Yeah.
                                          "This is Heaven-School. Learn your lines, without attribution."
Yes -- my Father agrees.   He does not care much for (so called) "Christian" music.
Sorry.
You are correct.
I thought the comma was a period.
Thank you for correcting me.
So --
4 setences total.
And -- the last sentence is the one I wanted to call our attention to:
                                          IIRC, Sixpence-None-the-Richer actually made good Christian music that could be popular in the main-stream. They're probably still pretty good.
Learn your lines, without attribution.
We are on the brink of a mini-lesson on that part of Piece #16.
Shall I continue ?
                                          Please.
Ok.   Thank you.
This is about Axiom #26.
And it is linked to that last (of the 4 sentences) in Piece of Light #16.
Yeshua said a number of things that we have a written record of.
And quite a few of them were things that He said about himself.
Like  :::
I am the door.
I am the light.
I am the way.
I am the bread.
I am the proof (son).
I am the truth.
I am the show (word).
... and the list goes on and on.
And in John 10:30 -- He says something that could also go on that list --
but He leave out the "am" -- even though it is really there --
because He uses the word "are".
What He said (exactly) is:
           "I and my Father are one."
At least -- those are the 6 words we find in John 10:30.
                                          Sounds like He couldn't count very well to me.  üòâ
Anyway.   The point I wish to make here is that --
most people believe that He was saying those things
about Himself.   And they are correct.   He was.
But.   What nearly everyone misses -- is the fact
that He was "feeding" us our own lines
for our own life.
That is what Piece #16 is saying.
When Piece 16 says:
                                          I have some serious "bones-to-pick" with PoL#16.
Learn your lines, without attribution --
it is telling us not to say:
"Yeshua said ....    Yeshua said ....    Yeshua said ....    "
                                          First of all, this "life" *is* life! "Life" is *not* whatever might come *after* life!
"without attribution" means -- don't attribute a line to someone else.
Make it your own.   Own it.   Say it yourself.   About your self.
So.   Yes.   Yeshua and The Father are One.
But I also am One with The Father.
                                          There may not be any such place as Heaven (yet), which would make this life certainly not accur8 to refer to as "Heaven-School" either.
And when Angie says:  "I and The Father are One."  ==
She and The Father and Yeshua are One.
And when Tim says it -- he also is part of the One.
So.   Bottom line.   Axiom #26 is simply pressing this idea home.
End of mini-lesson.
                                          Thank you for the mini-lesson.
You're welcome for the mini-lesson.
You've always known that you are a part of me.
But -- Axiom #26 says that I am also a part of you !!
                                          If this *is* life, nobody knows what comes after, this is *not* "Heaven-School", then would anyone have lines at all to learn?
A grreat question !!
Actually -- learning effectual lines -- has nothing to do with whether we believe in a hereafter or not.
Our "lines" are merely all of our self-talk.
The things we think about our self.
The good.
And the bad.
And -- unfortunately -- most of the self-talk -- of most people --
concentrates so very much -- on the bad.
Tragic !!
Sad.
And a killer !!
                                          Why make the context of PoL#16 Heaven-School where the curriculum is learning lines which supposedly have "nothing" to do with belief in a hereafter?
                                          Seems contradictory and confusing to be couched that way.
                                          Also, how do you (or could anyone) know that any particular lines are "actually effectual" to learn? How would such be determined?
"   I, the author of Octology, have much to share through that medium, which will improve the lives of those who embrace it.   "
A person says that.
Maybe in his head.
Maybe out loud.
Maybe both.
And then -- he finds out -- that that has actually happened.
This   is proof of Octology's     efficaciality.
                                          Okay Dad. I think that might be enough chatting for me for the night. Thank you very much for all the topics we got into.
                                          I ‚ù§ you!
                                          Hopefully we can chat again next Friday evening Sabbath, July 17th, around 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime, if not sooner.
Ok.
I have 1 other "hot" item on my PCA.
                                          Okay.
But it can certainly w8.
Nice mug -- by the way.
Thank you for this nice session.
                                          Thanks. It was a gr8 gift. It's the closest I get to seeing my family.
                                          You're welcome.
I ‚ù§ you Pip.
                                          Have a good rest of your night and weekend Dad.  üòä
You too young man.   And a sOOper week too.
6'07-11-20 - 0205 Gtime / 0105 Ptime ;
# K7PMFRID:had like 7-ish-hour chat with Dad. many hours skipped to just give little tail here for now;
Is it time for my other PCA ?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
What is your favorite browser ?
FireFox.
And before that one ?
Brave.
Hmm.
Not sure I ever heard of that one.
What do you think of Chrome ?
Brave is based on Chromium code-base, I.I.R.C..
Chrome is so-so.
Why is Firefox great ?
It does every major useful browser thing I like having pretty damn well.
Ok.
Thank you.
I have been using MS-IE "forever" -- and I love it.
But more and more websites are no longer supporting it.
I'm (stubbornly) hanging on to it --
but it is clear that I am not going to be
able to for much longer.   I had hoped that --
maybe MS Edge would be a possible --
but I don't think so (really).   I've been --
experimenting with Chrome -- but there are --
quite a few things that I don't like about it.
So -- do you recommend that I try FireFox ?
Yep.
Ok.   I shall try it.
Will you be willing (and able) to answer --
my tons of questions about it ?
No. I'm no expert. I'm a fundamentals kind of coder, writing tools to write tools. I don't do browser HTML or JavaScript work much at all. Maybe WebAssembly will change things somewhat soon and enable Perl to enter the browser-code milieu. I will answer what I can.
Ok.   Thank you.
If it (FireFox) can do what IE does --
for me -- I shall be happy to go with it.
But none of the browsers I've tried --
(Chrome,  Edge,  FireFox,   Opera)  appear --
to "look" anything like IE --
which means that I'm going to --
be in for a pretty steep learning curve !!
    Not a happy prospect.
But -- all is perfect.
Thank you My Lord.
You're not perfect, but you are welcome.
And thank you for your offer to help me in my transition.
That was my last "hot" PCA for this session.
Do you wish to discuss anything else now ?
Nah. I think we've hit enough for the night. Thanks for it all.
You are (most certainly) welcome.
Nice one.   Thank you too Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
üòä
Then -- does this look like arrivederci ?
Hopefully chat with you more again next Friday evening, July 31st `d8 K7V`;
2000 G / 1900 P ?
Yep. Have a gr8 week.  ‚ù§
I will if you will.
üòä
Yeah, `d8 K7VMJ`;

üòä
And how was your week ?
Thank you for asking. I had a mostly good week. How was yours?
Good for you.
I am quite happy about mine too.
Thank you for asking.
Details on yours ?
Umm I questioned more whether there's ways to discover truths about God, love, Heaven, Hell, etc. which is a sort of ongoing quandary for me it seems.
Excellent.
Go on please.
I tidied up some code in Octology (`g3` for audio-playback) which I checked in to my GitHub repository this afternoon (along with a few other minor upd8s).
Sounds good to me.
I discovered a cool alpha-transparency ability in my audio-visualiz8ion plug-ins too, which yields a really cool revealing effect.
"discovered"  or created ?
Discovered. It has been there under my nose for a while before I recognized that it works and how cool it looks.
What does it do ?
Well I have 15 different LibVisual plug-ins which each do somewhat different but all pretty cool things.
Like ?
Running `g3 -V` to list Vis plugs yields:
0    monoscope                                  Monoscope
1   spacescope                   Stereo visualizer
2 spectrascope                   Frequency spectrum scope
3   synaescope                                 Synaescope

And besides looking cool -- you use them for what ?
My code removes any redundancies, re-orders the plug-ins into 3 distinct groups: scopes, gooms, and more official libvisual ones, and I colored all the output and I added the ability to provide just their left-most column base-64 index character instead of requiring whole plug-in names like the default.
I see.
This is good -- yes ?
They seem to be somewhat in control of themselves and able to teach me insights into what can be done... and maybe how.
Yeah.
I can try to show you. Are you receiving video?
I am.    6 boxes of "tea" at the moment.
üòä
Yeah. Visualizers are pretty cool. I think they're totally gr8!  üòä
Me too !!
Thank you for sharing.
Were you able to see some of how my text terminal can show through or not?
I was.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm still w8ing for you to install CygWin or Ubuntu so you can learn to run Octology like I do.
Are John or Danny using it yet ?
Nope. Nobody but me is clearly a routine user yet. Getting anyone else to try it out is far more difficult than I imagined.
Any progress ?
Any nibbles from anyone else ?
I made some good progress on the project, but not really with any people yet.
Well -- good on the project.
I'd also like to hear about how you are going after the people.
I don't yet know how to go after any people.
That's ok.
You will.
As you ask the right questions --
the answers will come.
          Because -- they must.
Have we discussed the "QA Dynamic" before ?
Maybe somewhat. Maybe you could please go into it further?
Sure.
The basic lesson is quite short.
Take notes please.
------------------
Most children ask tons! of questions.
Almost constantly.
To the point where they soon drive their parents nuts !!
And then -- sometime betwixt the age of --
10 and 20 -- the frequency of their "question asking" --
begins to wane.    This is not good.
And one of the reasons that Piece #11 --
puts such a "press" on it.
Children soon (in their "askeries") find that --
their parents -- and even their teachers --
do not have as many answers as they had hoped.
In fact -- parents (and teachers) will often --
tell the askers -- that "there are some things
that we just can't know".
             And this is (flatly) untrue.
And here is why --
that is untrue.
            It is         The QA Dynamic.
Answers         are not          seeded by questions.
That is:  questions do not lead    to answers.
To put "The QA Dynamic" bluntly --
         If you can ask a question -- that is evidence that the answer already exists.
---------------------
Yes.   I can say more on this --
but I shall stop here for questions or comments.
(//)
In my experience, there are plenty of questions which can be asked for which no ready answer can be presented yet.
An answer may exist, which cannot be found yet.
This is true.
And what do you do when you encounter such ?
Attempt to answer them somewhat, and figure on revisiting as opportunity and need arise.
And how does that (usually) work out for you ?
Usually well enough, it seems.
Good.
Tell me about one which it has not worked for please.
Does a real Heaven exist, and if so, how and where?
Excellent.
Of course -- you realize that that is not a question.
It is 3 questions.
I tend to do that.
And this is one of the keys to good question-asking.
Do not ask multiples together.
Sometimes they go together.
In your mind -- yes -- I fully agree.
But -- if one wants good answers --
one must use the keys to getting good answers.
You will notice that when you ask me multiples --
in a single sentence -- I (nearly always) --
break it into singles -- and address them --
separately.
The end result being -- you get your "multiple" answered --
but it comes in pieces.
This is simply "using the keys".
‚Ä¢   One question at a time.
‚Ä¢   Shorties are best.
‚Ä¢   Ask 'em on paper.
Seems stilted to me. Multiple questions can describe intention.
It IS stilted Phlip.
The keys are stilted.
But -- keys are usually the best way --
to gain entrance to locked doors.
And -- I should respond to your 2nd comment too.
     " Multiple questions can describe intention. "
I think asking multiple questions provides keys for some locked doors too.
Ok.   I shall withhold my response then.
Do what works for you.
That is always best.
Some approaches are key when working with certain constraints which people impose, or circumstances mand8... while others may work better elsewhere.
Noted.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Thanks for reminding me that short singular questions are usually best when seeking answers from you.
You're welcome Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
I ‚ù§
you too.
üòä
How is Mozilla FireFox working out for ya?
Not too well.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
You might also benefit from trying the Brave Browser as a good altern8ive too.
I shall look into that.
Thank you for the suggestion.
U R wLcome.  üòâ
/Phlip/   /Philip/      (22 minutes ago)        Sorry.
Figured it could've been just an immeD8 example of "stilted", but probably was typographical error.
lol
Yep.
Typo.
You might benefit from learning PCRE for better abilities than just what you can wrap in slashes, someday?
Have you ever burned a DVD-R disc with any Ubuntu .iso image (64-bit Desktop)? Should be pretty easy to do in any MicroSoft Windows version I'd expect, as long as you have the hardware.
I have not -- yet.
Why don't you like my `d8` 8-character stamps as much as or more than your more verbose and still 3600ths less precise than what I've got going on?
I love your d8 stamps.
Why don't you care to run d8 yourself? What do you love about them?
I love the compactness of them.
Someday others will run d8 and like it better than what they relied on earlier too.
Why do you believe that to be so ?
Because it is vastly superior in so far mostly under-appreC8d aspects. It's a model.
Ok.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Do you have anything on your PCA for tonight?
Only 1 item.
But not important.
How about you ?
Umm I guess just one here too.
Ok Pip.     Let's have it please.
What have you wanted most for this hopefully Happy Birthday of yours in under an hour from now?
New sheets for my bed.
Right on. I hope someone can get you that.
Someone did.
Thank you for your hope.
It worked !!
Nice!
üòä
Yep.
What's your PCA item?
My Lampyridae Report
Ready for it ?
I hope so.  üòä
Ok.
Here 'tis.
On Thu Jul 09 2020 - at 0142 - I saw my 1st lightning bug in many years.
And then --
On Wed Aug 05 2020 - at 2027 - I saw another one.
           End of Lampyridae Report
Cool. Maybe I can give a Lightning-Bug-Talk on Perl someday when I might try to do some live code fixing... if I ever figure out how to Octology to be used by some semblance of an audience.  üòâ
Maybe.
s/how to Octology/how to get Octology/;
I'm definitely voting for that last part.
When I was a kid -- on any summer night --
It would be gr8 to learn if you can run most of Octology within just CygWin or an Ubuntu dual-boot scenario.
we would see dozens and dozens of fireflies (Lampyridae).
It would be great.
I agree.
Do you have any reasons why Octology could not improve your computer interactions?
Give me one example please.
Maybe too much of it is so dense with patterns that it somehow leaves you with no lasting impression of what it can do for you?
Possibly so.
Tell me one thing please.
One thing it can do for me.
It can autom8 most of your eventual usage of d8 to record precise date+time stamps, wherever you could find them to be useful.
Ok.
Thank you.
I have a few questions.
You're welcome. Almost every part of Octology should do something useful.
When (what year) did you start developing Octology ?
Octology has inherited much of my old CPAN.Org code, so pretty long ago like around 2005 mainly, but the original 8.utf file which has provided the backbone for the rest of the project was started on June 27th of 2013. I developed most of it discreetly in priv8 for over 4 years (just soliciting feedback from the closest 8 people I could think of that I'd want help from to do so). After almost no feedback from anyone, I finally decided to release the project source code publicly to GitHub on October 13th of 2017, so it will have been widely available online for 3 whole years in just over 2 more months now.
Good.
Thank you.
Next question:
You're welcome. Hopefully I can get a lot done over the next year to see if its 8th year of active development can be the one which sees it take off with some small dedic8d user-base.
From 2005 to 2017 -- who did you have in mind to be using it -- as you were continuing to develop it ?
Everyone who could benefit from using computing devices proficiently, or at least competently.
Excellent.
Now.   Next question:
Why do you think that in its first 34 months (since its initial public release) it has garnered a total of zero confirmed users ?
Because I have essentially no practical awareness of how to properly crE8 a brand for the project, providing a persuasive promise to prospective users, marketing and promoting what's best about it while de-emphasizing the less-compelling aspects, etc..
Ok.
Thank you.
I haven't yet figured out anything I need to that would enable anyone else to realize how much better Octology is than not using it.
Why doesn't your Dad use it ?
I'm not sure. I think he *could* ... but is unwilling to try to for some reasons, so far.
Good answer.
Why doesn't Danny use it ?
I think he's a pretty deeply entrenched MicroSoft Windows user, and Octology is likely to run best on a GNU/Linux distribution which might appear quite foreign and unwelcoming to you, my Dad.
Danny doesn't see any value in running any of the code himself yet. His Ubuntu GNU/Linux computer already does what he wants it to, so Octology offers little to him presently. He recently remarked that he thought it was coded in Python (rather than Perl). He hasn't learned yet even the most basic aspects of my software system. Beppu-san either. Oh well. Maybe one of you will adopt some of Octology, someday.
Can you make it run on MS Windows ?
Maybe you guys have had the most and earliest chances to catch on with what Octology is becoming, but maybe others will become productive users before any of you do (for whatever reasons).
If you installed CygWin on your MS Windows, then yes, probably most of Octology should become executable for you.
Have you written a "User's Manual" for Octology ?
An even better more full-fE8ured way might be to install Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit Desktop in a dual-boot configur8ion alongside your main Windows partitions (although this route would admittedly be made a bit more difficult when needing to resize and re-alloc8 disk-drive partitions coincidentally between both of your RAID drives).
Umm not exactly any "User's Manual" has been written yet.
Why not ?
I've added basic -h parameters to the most deserving commands to output help text. They are all described uniformly by the `sumb` (SUMmarize Binaries) command. They also may contain abundant embedded document8ion which is more focused on the implement8ion details rather than end-user scenarios.
Almost all the code is executable. Each command with default and configurable output is sort of documenting its own abilities more than any classic style "User's Manual" is likely to be able to.
At what age do children begin to learn what are commonly called "computer literacy" subjects ?
I can't say that I know. I've barely spent any time around kids throughout my adult life.
Ok.
Octology is probably best used by adults first, with kids gaining such power probably somewhat l8r, after some significant matur8ion.
A person that is considered to be "computer literate" at the age of 18 -- will know how to use what particular software packages ?
As far as Octology literacy would be concerned, an adult (probably male) would know how to use almost every executable utility available within the main public repository, as well as some significant ability to write their own customiz8ions which better suit their particular needs than the defaults have been able to.
Good.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Happy Birthday Papa! I ‚ù§
you and hope you enjoy a gr8 celebr8ion of yourself today.
Thank you Philip.
That's so nice of you.
I ‚ù§
 you too.
6'08-08-20 - 0327 Gtime / 0227 Ptime
Are you off to bed?
Is it time to ?
Not necessarily. Just saw your stamp as an indic8ion that could be the case.
Nope.
Here's my d8-stamp: K88M2WP2
Ah yes.
Very nice.
Thank you.
What else would you like to chat about ?
If God turned out to be more evil than good, more deceptive than truthful, more committed to hiding than to revealing, then do you imagine you would still be inclined to side with Him for any reasons you could mention?
Well -- I'm going to treat that as a reasonable question --
and then my answer would have to be:
     in my vast experiences with Him --
     He has not turned out to be --
     any of those 3 --
     so -- I am not only ever on His side -- but --
     I am His side --
     as well as His all --
     as are also you.
I don't think I am His side or His all. Can you please explain how I might be?
Sure.
You are the living, breathing, walking, talking --
Son (proof) of Him.
     I see Him in you.
How can you be at all sure it's Him you're seeing in me? Couldn't it be just mainly me you see, or why not?
The Father is not provable.
Neither is Sis provable.
Only the Son is provable.
And there you are.
How is "not provable" different from "not existent"?
You are the Proof of God.
I look no further.
I see that you are Love.
Why do you look no further for Proof?
The Scriptures tell me that Love is God.
Ergo  :::
You are God.
I can love (probably, but I wish we'd at least use Eros, Philia, Storg, and Agape or Hebrew varE8ions to start distinguishing better what we mean by the loaded term "love")...
... but I don't think I *am* Love (UpperCased).
Agape.
It's ok.
Your mirror is cloudy.
My eye is clear.
I see the true who of you.
My love is almost always exclusive, conditional, requiring some reciprocity, etc..
What specifically do you "see" that's a truer image of who I am than I can see in mirrors?
You say you see in you --
that which I cannot.
That is your privilege.
I just does not change what I know to be true of you.
How could you know such a thing to be true though?
I am not the judge for any other than my self.
However --
If I allow any other than my self to be my judge --
I have ceased to be true to my self.
Therefore --
You are God.
I see you.
/I/  /It/
How is God God? What qualifies Him to the term? Super-human somehow? How is He seen in me?
4 Qs.
Answers follow.
#1   How is Love Love ?     English grammar answers that one.
#2   Please see answer to #1.
#3   Yes.   You are super-human.  
            You are that before you became human.
#4   He cannot help but be seen in you.   He is you.
Before Abraham was -- you am.
What makes a God different from a man? How am I super-human (regardless of whether that came about before or after I became human)?
2 more Xcellent Qs !!
#6   God is not different from a man.
        You are that man.
If God is Love and Love is God, and God is me, but I am *not* Love, nor do I seem to be particularly God-like in abilities yet, then those posited equivalencies fall apart. We're not all the same!
   Whoops.   That was #5 -- not #6.
#6   You transcend time.
       You are eternal.
Maybe those.
Good observations Pip.
The "yet" is the key.
You do not "yet" see you.
But I am only one step ahead of you.
Just far enough to turn around --
and see the true who of you.
What about your sight enables you to know it to be "true" compared to what I see in myself predominantly so far?
Another grreat Q.
Here be the answer.
#7   I have My Father's eyes.
      But -- since you do not (yet) believe in The Father --
      you do not (yet) have His eyes.
How can you have Proof for the "unprovable"?
#8   The Son is never unprovable.
       The Son (by definition) is The Proof.
Of Himself only though, logically. He's no Proof of the unprovable Father or HolySpirit.
How do the Father or HolySpirit do anything meaningful at all if they can't be proven to handle some-such meaning somehow consistently?
#9   A (perfectly) valid question.
       Answer for me this please:
       How do you (Philip / The Son) do anything meaningful at all ?
I'm a real man, who can do actual things, in the mundane physical material world. The purported Father and Spirit are of a different kind.
Xcellent Pip.
And you are of a different kind also.
Only -- you do not (yet) see it.
Even though I (already) do.
What are the fE8ures of what you "see"?
Love.
Agape.
Are you possibly seeing in me more of what you want to see in me, as opposed to what is actually a component of me which is visible and resembles your conceptual ideal somehow?
Another Xcellent Q Pip.
My Father cannot see those (according to you) part of you which are not Love.
And -- as He and I are one -- what He cannot see -- neither can I.
I insist that I don't think I'm UpperCased Love itself most of the time. I do not try or wish or endeavor to exhibit unconditional, unjustifiable, unwarranted, undeserved, impractical, unethical Agape form of "love". Lots of Philia, some Eros, minimal Storg, and almost no Agape... seems to be my primary composition.
/part/  /parts/
You get to decide what you "think" of you.
What are the contours of "Love" that you "see"?
But you do not get to decide what I (nor My Father) think of you.
Sorry Susan.
Out of your domain.
üòä
üòä
If I know myself better than either you or your Father know me though, I should be able to have some influence on what decisions you each might consider best to make.
So say you.
And that (also) is your privilege.
Yet -- such does not alter our privilege.
Right. Nobody seems to know me better than I know myself, yet.
You "seems" will change.
When "yet" becomes full-filled.
/You/  /Your/
If God were real and knew me better than I know myself, He should be able to authentic8 Himself to me unambiguously somehow and then convey what He knew that I couldn't know yet but would certainly want to know as well. A few gestures like this would go a long way to building a bridge of trust and mutual rapport, I think.
Xcellent Philip.
You w8 for He (in which you believe not) to build it.
He w8s for you to.
Could be. What appears to be each of our hold-ups building toward each other from your vantage-point?
What has He built in any serious way?
I love it.
You have been building it (the bridge) --
     for many years already.
You have been seeking.
Seeking is the construction.
This is all about Hebrews 11:6.
https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-6.htm
Of course -- the key to this verse --
is this (silly) word:  "faith".
     And what is "faith" ?
This chapter is the "Faith" chapter in the Bible.
Have you read my know.ls section on "f8h"?
And verse 1 defines the word.
https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm
https://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology/blob/master/dox/2du/know.ls from lines 257 on down to 352.
Thank you.
Yes -- I have read it before.
And I have it up right now too.
You're welcome. Yeah. I don't think "f8h" is a good thing to have or try to defend.
/read/  /readd/
I think f8h is bad. Requiring it is probably evil.
Belief without reason, holding fast to your hopes, behaving as if certain about unverifiable events... these are garbage. Refuse. Detritus.
You (Philip) believe (by unwarranted "faith") that I (your earthly Dad) am writing these lines to you.
Bloating bias into belief is berry bad.
But -- this is silly.
You have no proof that I exist.
No. I believe. Not by unwarranted "faith".
You merely choose to "believe" that I am in Pennsylvania / breathing --
and typing.
But -- you have no proof that that be so.
While I can't yet see you until you also obtain a web-cam, I believe you might be able to be persuaded to do so someday eventually.
You merely choose to believe it.
That is faith.
Choosing to believe something which you cannot see.
This would give me more confidence that my belief that I am actually sharing an online chat interface with you, my living breathing typing Dad.
Heb 11;1.
That you take time and include reasonable typographical errors and corrections and seem to correspond most with what I knew of you before we had begun chatting like this, all of these have contributed to my confidence that we are engaging with each other.
I have reason to believe that we chat almost weekly together.
I don't simply merely choose to believe it.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Faith is belief in the absence of reason, based on hopes and wishes and superstitions, primarily as far as I can tell.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
You'
Whoops.
You've got it Pip.
Carve that in stone !!
     " Faith is belief in the absence of reason, based on hopes and wishes  ",
Faith is not reason.
Faith is silly.
If I make a choice in the matter, it's the deliber8 concerted choice to limit my beliefs to things for which there's decent evidence for (i.e., reason).
As are all hopes & wishes.
But we all have "those silly things".
We each have faith.
And only each individual gets to choose --
which they hold on to --
and which they dismiss or discard.
Each God-suit is The Lord of that (individual) life.
Each one is  :::
                         God.
How is each God-suit actually just God when there's supposed to be only One (and 3) and He doesn't have any such "suit"?
How ?
I don't know how.
What makes a suit more "God" than "man"?
I only know (by my own silly faith) that that is.
Tha suit is the man.
A suit of flesh -- is -- the God-man.
The 2nd Person of God.
The Proof of God.
Your video closed.
On purpose ?
Not on purpose. The window crashed.
Oh.
It's back.
Thank you.
You're welcome. I wish you'd also invest in any USB web-cam like LogiTech which ought to work out well enough on your end too for our video-chats to be better balanced by letting each of us see (and maybe also hear) the other.
If you assume that your Father and His Holy Spirit exist, how can spirits ever interact with the material world and how can anyone be sure they're hearing from purported "spiritual" communic8ion channels directly and undisruptedly to either or both of Them? How can you tell them apart in any of your thoughts which you think must origin8 from Them?
2 more (very!) good questions Pip.
I'll be happy to answer them too.
But first --
 
Hebrews 11 is the "faith" chapter.
All 40 verses.
 
https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11.htm
 
It starts with the definition of faith --
which clearly admits that --
faith is entirely "reasonless".
 
And then goes on to cite examples of
more than a dozen "unreasonable" people
who chose to believe (be-living)
unreasonable things.
 
Among them were Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, Joseph,
Abel, Enoch, Noah, Moses,
Gideon, Samson, Samuel,
David -- many others.
 
All "silly" people.
Believing (living) in fables.
 
Hopes.
Wishes.
Dreams.
Believing in a bogus God who primarily acted in yes fables, I'm inclined to agree that sounds rather "silly" ... but also somewhat ill-advised if you're at all prepared to contend with reality as it can be experienced and navig8d.
If He's real in any important way, then recognizing this would be wholly approprE8 for whoever could though too.
Go on please.
It wouldn't just appear "silly" to hold f8h if there were tangible real-world reasons to do so.
Thank you.
Good statement Pip.
There may be survival advantages on communal levels with respect to Evolutionary Biology, which may yet persist, even if the belief can only mainly be of metaphorical truth values.
Connection to cultural heritage, tradition, ceremony, feasts, music, dance, solemnity, reverence, awe, etc. are all of course actually apparent reasons why a life of f8h can make good sense from several perspectives.
Pip's Dad agrees.
Pip just requires bodies for rel8able mutual contact and discourse to be meaningful. If this Father has no body, what can He actually do? What good could He be?
Ah ha.
But He has a body.
Yours.
Angie's.
Tim's.
How does He have my body though? What of it does He control how?
Mandy's.
Katy's.
He controls only the parts you decide that you want Him to control.
All the other parts -- are controlled by you.
You are the Lord of Him.
Is there an almost exhaustive list of these "parts" of which you speak?
He is your servant.
Yes.
Exhaustive.
Infinite.
Does every person have infinite parts?
Yep.
Infinite.
How could that be known?
lol
Do I sound like I know it ?
Probably.
Of course I do.
I designed the world.
With you.
How? When? Where?
And Angie, and Mom, and Rosie and Ginny and Dan --
all signed=off on it.
Is that weird ?
That I signed-off on Mom --
leaving me in December of 1982 ?
Yep.
Yeah. Weird. How did we design anything?
I signed off on even that !!
You designed your life.
Both the good (enjoyable) parts --
and the painful too.
Were you nuts ?
No.
Just    wise    beyond    measure    !!
Wow! That would be incredibly powerful if we all designed our lives. How could we have done so though?
I don't remember.
That was another of our incredibly wise features.
We looked over the entire plan --
and all said --
"So be it." --
and then said --
" And we shall (now) forget how we did it. "
Why ?
Wouldn't that generally be a very bad idea, forgetting something that important?
Of course --
for the joy of daily (momentary) discovery --
forever.
          We are so neat !!!
Ah. Right on, I guess.
Something rather special in d8 will occur in just under 3 hours from now, when there will be 6 simultaneous 8 digits within the stamp at K88M8888. Slightly momentous!  üòâ
More than slightly.
Is there a meaningful distinction you're able to identify which soundly demark8s me apart from your Father or His purported Son?
Not sure I completely understand the question.
Help ?
How do I differ from the Son?
You do not.
You are The Son (The Proof).
Am I the Father too?
Absolutely.
However --
you do differ from The Father.
Not in essence.
But in operation.
Whoa! How?
What you (specifically) do.
You show me things about your Godness that Angie does not show me.
Nor Tim.
Nor Mandy.
Nor Mom.
Katy.
Rosie.
And --
they each show me Godnesses that you do not.
But none of you are less (or more) God than any of the other Sons.
Ye are all proofs.
You've gotta check out this rad new S3RL video https://YouTu.be/OF-thWTJcu0
If all mankind are proofs of whatever perceived or imagined God, how do we not prove more not God if we're mainly mere menfolk && musk?
Not sure I understand that one.
Help again ?
If mankind all prove God, don't we also prove not God by being mainly just men?
I'm still not sure I've got your "drift" -- but I'm gonna try it.
We all prove God -- yes.
We all (also) prove that there are (other) spirits --
which are not God -- which (from time to time) are --
being given "way" in us --
by our own permission.
Did I answer the "right" (your intended) question ?
How are (other) spirits given "way" in us with permission?
At times -- I choose not to "be" God
That is -- not act as I know He would.
During those moment -- I am not His proof.
I have chosen to (temporarily) "step out" of my Sonship.
/moment/  /moments/
I might also add --
He (The Father) does not witness those moments.
They just leave "a hole" in my walk.
They are not recorded.
These "moments" are commonly referred to as --
"sin".
They were all fore-given.
I think it should be "sin" to amput8 any part of a new-born's genitalia.
-- before we forgot how we designed all this.
So beautiful we are.
!!
I think we'd be beautiful even without fore-giveness!
The "beauty" I am referring to here is --
the overall beauty of our design.
Although forgetting "sin" is likely to make it much harder to recognize and remember to avoid, if important. I think "sin" should be recorded too.
Our human minds record it.
But -- when our (human) skinsuit is --
amput8ed from our Spirit --
no one remembers the "sin" any longer.
This is part of the "everyone is saved" package.
No one has to do anything -- to "go" to Heaven.
Getting dipped into a lake of water does not "save" anyone.
All that man-made stuff is merely symbolic.
How could you discern "man-made" from other?
Salvation was finished (for all of us) --
before Adam began breathing.
Great question Pip.
The answer is:
Piece #11 & Piece #2.
Thank you. Many questions can be good, even if paper isn't as much for me.
Typing is essentially equivalent.
You're welcome.

And how was your week ?
Rather mixed, but the latter part has gotten mostly good. Thanks! How was yours?
I'm glad to hear that.
üòä
Quite Xcellent -- thank you for asking.
And the latter half got even gooder.
Your prayer ("hope") was very powderful !!
You said:
Not a prayer.
Hope is different. I thought we went through that.
          I hope you can discover better ways to help
          you keep better focus on more positive things
          than those that can be instead more detrimental.
And -- your "hope" (non-prayer) worked.
I found myself hearing your words in
my head all week.  And -- as your are
"My Lord" (boss) -- had to obey you.
Thank you so much.
üòä
You're welcome.
Although this is not important -- I wish to
get into it anyway.   Permiso ?
Yes.
Thank you.
Here goes.
I believe that I and My Father are One.
Am I crazy for believing that ?
Yeah.
lol
Thank you very much.
If you are not your Father, you are not "One".
My Father is (said by The Bible to be) "Love".
And -- what say you ?
Am I "Love" ?
No. Love is not a person.
Good.
Thank you.
Next Q:
What does "love" do ?
Depends.
Which "love" are you asking about?
Either agape or philia -- or both.
Are those nouns, verbs, adjectives, or something else?
Well -- in the question "What does love do ?"  --
the "love" is a noun.
Do you consider agape to be somehow "unconditional"?
I consider agape to only be conditioned (dependent)
on the qualities (or characteristics) of the donor --
not at all -- on those of the recipient.
What are those donor qualities?
Good question.
Answer:  affection for the other person.
How do you conceive of philia being different?
The "philia" love is dependent (conditioned) --
on the qualities (or characteristics) of the recipient.
Those being?
Depends.
We can ("philia") love different things (nouns).
The standard "noun" categories are:
  ‚Ä¢  people
  ‚Ä¢  places
  ‚Ä¢  things
 
Examples would be:
  ‚Ä¢  Angie Renee
  ‚Ä¢  San Luis Obispo
  ‚Ä¢  Mom's chicken kiev
Philia-love is (usually) about --
what the thought of the recipient --
does for me.
Did I answer your last question ?
Maybe not.
GOP
You seem to have indic8d that agape is only about your affection for another person, irrespective of any of their qualities. Can that one be toward noun things too, beyond just people?
I believe so.   A love for things (and places) --
although it can (also) be philia --
I can agape (love) things (and places) --
purely out of my respect for them.
For example:
The earth.
The sky.
Rivers, streams, oceans.
Of course -- this is about preserving
(not polluting) them.
Can you start that whole text over please? It doesn't rEad properly to make sense.
"A love for things -- although it can be philia -- I can agape things -- purely out of my respect for them."  What?!
Ok.  I'll try to say it a little differently.
Wait!
Ok.
I'm w8ing.
What do em-dashes ( "--" ) mean when you use them?
The quoted sentence doesn't make sense.
I usually use em-dashes to indicate "a pause in speech" --
sort of like a comma -- but a pause lonnger than a comma.
But --
In "chatting" -- I also use them at the --
end of any given line -- to indicate that --
there is more to come.
Dumb.
Ellipses are better for that.
Yes I am.
You are correct.
I do not like ellipses ... -- because --
they are not so seeable.
Or just type a whole sentence together at once, and not need either. You're communic8ion is too stilted, broken, fragmentary, and then often disjointed and fails to parse coherently.
Ok.
Thank you.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're welcome.
Do you have difficulty seeing ellipses?
I do.
Could you get glasses that would help you with that?
Probably not.   I have attempted to do so   But my vision problems are multi-typed -- and what I seem to need is something like 20x magnification and super-high contrast.
Ah. I'm sorry to hear that detailed sight is such a significant challenge for you. I hope you can discover and attain some solution to that issue ahead.
An 48-foot by 27-foot computer monitor would help.
üòä
Can you try to find a better "Magnifier" program than the default one that I think you previously indic8d was inadequ8 to meet your zooming needs?
I'd love huge displays too. Hopefully eventually we'll both become capable of acquiring enough of them to improve the amount of computer output we can clearly discern.
Yep.
So.   Tell me about your "gotten mostly good" week please.
Are you sure you want to discard the previous topics which haven't been dealt with well yet, and instead start in on my description of some of my past week?
Postpone, yes.
Are you up for sharing past week stuff now ?
Some.
Ok.                   Some is acceptable.
Thank you.
I've been thinking a lot about various descriptions of presumed to be supernatural beings and arguments for and against those and other religious, philosophical, and ethical topics.
I've also been planning and have started describing 2 new side-projects that I intend to attempt to get rolling ahead.
I've also spent a bunch of time traversing all sorts of complex assoC8ions between people, places, things, names, lyrics, games, movies, etc. often causing me to burst into uproarious laughter when striking upon various hilarious phrasings and clever meanings. Some has been poignant too. It has been interesting, challenging, sometimes quite fun, and also somewhat less frequently disturbing or concerning.
Of my plans to start 2 new projects, the first I'm thinking of calling something like "Infinite Games", which would probably become a sub-set of my main Octology project on GitHub.
It would be to develop open-source code and art assets to basically re-implement many classic arcade and home-console video-games before next summer arrives.
Sounds interesting.
My second project would be to work on developing video content for a YouTube channel which fE8ures me as "PedantPip", who meticulously breaks down arguments into even very minute details.
Ah so.
Do you (now) have a YouTube channel ?
Yes. "PipStuart" is the account name under which my existing YouTube channel can be found. I might start a sepR8 new one for "PedantPip", or just partition it under my existing one.
There are very many things I want to become particularly productive working on and toward ahead, and especially intensely hopefully throughout most of the coming Winter.
I see 9 uploads.
Is that correct ?
3 are your Pittsburgh thing.
I only see 7 on my channel. Maybe you're seeing 2 more than me somehow. Not sure why that might be occurring.
Sorry.   Yes.   I get 7 too.
2 non-Pip are interlaced.
What was your week like?
Grreat !!
Highly productive.
In all areas.
Quite moderate eating.
Very nice! Glad to hear that.
Very minimal YT movies.
Some days = 0.
I fasted one day this week.
I'm back to taking showers more often than once every 3 weeks.
That "I like myself" on my walls -- is becoming truer and truer.
I'm happy with the "past week" me.
üòä
Thank you for asking.
üòä
You're welcome.
What camera did you use on your "Darjee" YT ?
Probably the one on the back of my Samsung GalaxyS8 mobile phone.
And the same on the Garbage Pail Kids ?
Yep.
How many cameras do you have -- other than the Galaxy & the one on your computer ?
Just one other that's tiny and connects via USB, like the one connected to my main computer (Oni), just smaller and without any legs to stand. Probably pretty low quality capabilities compared with my other ones.
So -- 3 total ?
4. Phone has 2. Front is poor. Back is strong.
Ok.   Good.   4.   Thank you.
So the "Oni" one is the best ?
Maybe. The phone's back one might be somewhat better. Not quite sure yet.
You used the Galaxy-back for the 3 Darjee videos ?
Oni's one has a tripod stand and can pivot-swivel the top though, so that part might make it best regardless of the technical specs.
Probably.
And the Oni one for the 3 Pittsburgh videos ?
No. Zoom screen-capture plus Oni's main for my face in the corner.
I mean: Yeah.
Yes -- that's what I meant.
Sorry. Misreadd it.
Can you get "landscape" instead of "portrait" from the Galaxy -- or would that just capture "portrait-sideways" ?
Not sure yet. Would have to play around with it and test more.
Ok.
Just thinking about high-quality video for your upcoming YT projects.
There are tons & tons of schlock YT things out there.
Thanks. Nice of you. Yeah, I'll try to do the best I can with what I have to work with so far.
Their content is interesting -- but their lack of technical quality is very distracting.
And -- when I say "technical quality" -- I mean  ‚Ä¢  video quality (sometimes)  ‚Ä¢  audio quality (frequently)  ‚Ä¢  and other things (which we shall discuss further at the appropriate time).
Right on.
You're welcome.
Anything on your PCA ?
Not really. Was somewhat intending to mention "NfN8gAmz" and "PedantPip" new project ideas with you, which I've already done above.
s/with/to/;
Ok.   Thank you.
Are you going to ask about my PCA ?
Yes. What remains on your PCA?
Oh.  Ok.  Thank you for asking.
üòä
5 items.
2 covered.
3 remaining.
Ready for first one ?
Yes.
Okeedoke.
Thank you.
Here comes.
 
                              My Bad Clock
  
For quite a few weeks now -- my clock
stuff has been wrong.  In fact -- I had
put the subject on my PCA a couple of
weeks ago -- wanting to discuss it with
you.
However (this week) I remembered you
telling me (a while back) that some things
which I ask of you -- could (possibly)
be answered more fully by going online.
So -- Thursday evening (Sep 3) I did that.
Without sharing all the detailia -- the
bottom line is -- that my "clock stuff"
is no longer 2 minutes slow.  Sorry for
my suggesting (by my chat time-stamps)
that yours and mine didn't agree.
               It was mine that was incorrect.
üòä
(//)
It's fine. I knew that was most likely the case. Glad you could figure out how to fix yours.  üòä
Me too.   Thank you.
Ready for next item ?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
Here comes.
 
            Weather Report
 
We have had hints that September is about to arrive.
In the past 4 days -- the temp is down slightly
-- but the humidity is still rather high.
But both need to become lower before "September"
can be (officially) declared to have arriven.
H'ever.  The forcast says that tonight's low will
be in the upper 50s -- and that will be the first
time we have seen that -- since May.
In the long range forecast -- it appears that
next Friday (Sep 11 2020) will probably be
the "official" beginning of what I (generally)
call "September Weather".
 
[end of Weather Report]

Thanks.
wLcome.
3rd?
Ah yes.
I believe we have a "3" in the house.
Here comes.
 
                      Never Been To Europe
 
I've never been to Europe.
  
I've been to Hawaii (in 2008).    I gave
it to myself as my 65th Birthday Present.
And I've been to Canada -- twice.
      1958 - Niagara Falls -- with parents
      1986 - Vancouver (Expo 86) October (with me)
And I've been to Southeast Asia (1966-67)
    ‚Ä¢  Taiwan
    ‚Ä¢  Viet Nam
    ‚Ä¢  China (Hong Kong)
But -- I've never been to Europe.
Daddy was in the 1940s.  Germany I think.
Mother was.  Scandinavia (I believe).
    1980s ?           Not sure when.
But me -- never.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Back in the 80s -- I was thinking about where
I'd like to visit.  There were quite a few
places in the USA -- and by now -- I have done
many of them -- but many are yet to do.
The biggie of those is "The Henry Ford Museum"
in Michigan.  But there are a number of others
too -- like South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, and
Idaho -- which are 4 of the 6 states which I have
never been to.  The other 2 are Michigan & Alaska.
However -- also in this "where I'd like to visit"
thinkery -- (in the 80s) the 2 primes were:
  
  ‚Ä¢  Hawaii
  ‚Ä¢  Paris
  
Well.  I did Hawaii (the Island of Kauai) in October
          of 2008.  Truly "The Vacation of a Lifetime" !!
        And since then -- the "Paris" idea has
        become considerably less important.
But -- I do think about Europe from time to time.
In fact -- on Wednesday (Sep 02) -- I spent about
4 hours researching Europe stuff -- and got quite
involved in it -- especially the geography -- which
has always been a great interest to me.  ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  I've
loved geography ever since I first started studying
it in gradeschool.
And (in that "Wednesday" research) I wrote up a bunch
of stuff on European geography.  I thought maybe I'd
share it with you tonight -- but (later) thought it
would probably bore you to death.
H'ever, I will share the map with you -- because of what
I'm going to say about "where I might like to visit" --
in the remainder of this essay.  ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  Here 'tis.
 
  
     There are 45 countries in Europe.
 
And of those 45 -- there are about 6 -- which are of
some particular interest to me.  I believe I have listed
them here -- in my approximate order of interest:
 
    ‚Ä¢  Greece
    ‚Ä¢  Switzerland
    ‚Ä¢  France
    ‚Ä¢  Italy
    ‚Ä¢  UK (especially Scotland & England)
    ‚Ä¢  Ireland
 
 
Yet.  If I never get to see any of them
(while breathing) -- I shall not find
myself lamenting over that too much.
 
                        [end of essay on Europe]

Thank you.
Well I think maybe we can wrap things up for this week and probably re-connect again next Friday evening. Hope you experience another good productive week ahead.  üòä
I hope the same for you Pip.
Next Friday sounds like a plan.
Thank you for tonight.
Have I told you lately that I ‚ù§
 you ?
Well.   If not -- I ‚ù§

Keep smiling My Lord.

5'09-11-20 - 2011 Gtime / 1911 Ptime
Same to you My Lord.
üòä
How was your week ?
Umm, first I'm no "Lord". Would your "Father" approve of you referring to another as an upper-case "Lord" (or yourself as u-c "My")? It's pretty weird that you have taken to doing so. I am a man. I expect you are too. Why do you do this, and how do you justify it?
I thought I had explained this before -- but apparently insufficiently.
So -- as you are my boss -- and you have requested it -- I shall do it again.
Thank you for asking.
Here 'tis.
The word "lord" means "boss".
The capital "L" that I use -- when I apply it to you -- is simply a matter of respect for who you are -- which is quite similar to the capitalizing of the first names of any person.   If I were to address you as "pip" or "philip" -- that would seem to me to lack respect for you.
Doesn't upper-case "Lord" imply "God" though, more than merely some typical proper-noun like "Pip"?
I am aware that it is a popular notion to believe that the word "lord" is a synonym for the word "God".   But I do not see it as such.   The word "lord" simply means "boss" -- and a boss is anyone who one serves.
Thank you for clarifying that again. I struggle with the connot8ions of many things that seem somehow objectionable or disagreeable to me in their typical expressions and meanings or implic8ions and maybe also ramific8ions.
It can be an employer -- it can be a customer -- it can be a teacher's student -- it can be a family member -- it can be a friend -- this list goes on and on.
You are welcome.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
You may ask me anything.
And re-ask me whenever you wish.
I reciproc8 that sentiment, thinking probably almost no question which might occur to you should be unacceptable. I'd like for you to be and feel able to ask me anything as well.
Thank you Pip.
Thank you. If I find more to query you about it, I will ask when my next opportunity arises.
I ‚ù§
 you.
I ‚ù§
you too.
Good.
Thank you.
Okay, well I've had a rather profoundly challenging week. I've been turning over in my mind many deep thoughts about what may be appropriate to aspire for. I've also been facing some rather disturbing realiz8ions and coordin8d impositions.
GOP
I'm not sure whether I can delve into too many of the details of those matters with you yet, as I'm still needing time to mull them over further and hopefully stabilize my thinking and how I might best convey or characterize them once I've done so sufficiently.
I can say that I'm not particularly worried about them, but am needing to reflect on, and probably somewhat significantly revise, my earlier aspir8ions and intentions.
Ok
Thank you.
You're welcome.
üòä
How was your week?
Mixed.   Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.  üòä
Care to share why you found it mixed?
I shall.
Some parts were undisciplined.
H'ever -- I did spend about 20 hours on the drafting of a number of FTR Scripts.   So I was happy about that.
Well it should be usually okay to be rel8ively undisciplined some of the time. Drafting FtR Scripts for about 20 hours sounds like you've probably done some significant work though too. How do you feel about the progress you're making there, besides just being happy about it?
I feel good about the progress of drafting FTR Scripts.   It's encouraging.   The typical output of those is usually 3 or 4 per week -- which translates to about 175 per year.   And that is nice.   ¬∂   When this Covid-19 gift winds up -- and we begin to do FTR Seminar -- I shall have tons and tons of Scripts in my files.
/Seminar/  /Seminars/
The titles of the 4 Scripts done this past week were:
  ‚Ä¢  Haste & Waste
  ‚Ä¢  Satisfaction
  ‚Ä¢  Santa 2 - God 1
  ‚Ä¢  Philosophy vs Religion
 I don't know if now is the best time to bring this up, but I've spent some time reflecting on your "29 Pieces of Light" as well as the minority of "FarFar's 27 Axioms" that you've made available to me so far... and I have some concerns and complaints which might be worth discussing and addressing somewhat, if not now then probably eventually. I've also seen a powerfully moving video by James Jani contextualizing and criticizing self-help / self-development rather generally, which may also warrant some concerted engagement with at some point too. What do you think about these?
You may launch into either or both whenever you wish.   Now is fine.
Okay. Well maybe we can start with PoL#6. "FarFar's 27 Axioms" are mentioned as a single entry on your publicly published ILoveThis.Org site, but it seems unfair or unjustifiably coy or covert or something to restrict provision of these Axioms to only when you consider them to be needed, but remain unwilling to provide the whole list in its entirety for consider8ion and scrutiny and evalU8ion and dissemin8ion (if indeed they contain valuable advice, instruction, wisdom, etc.).
Would you please re-consider filling in my 14 vacancies out of the 27? I'm missing 2 through 5, 7, 9 through 13, 20, 21, 24, and 25.
Response to Paragraph #1:
Thank you.   I hear that.
Response to Paragraph #2:
Is there a particular reason to suggest to someone that they might do something that they are already doing ?
Yes. If your Pieces of Light are meant to be public, yet some of the details are kept secret or obscured, then the whole meaning, significance, context, etc. described by them is porous and partially impotent unnecessarily. Please recognize that if 29 PoL are to be taught and shared, then so too ought to be their interpret8ions and details, so that the list is comprehensible and able to be challenged and critiqued within the broader context.
On point #1 - Noted.   Thank you.
On point #2 - thank you for that observation.   I shall devote some further mullery to that.
You're welcome. In case we become unable to continue chatting online together weekly (or at all regularly over some other dur8ion), it would disappoint me substantially to have obtained only less than half of all your "Father's" Axioms. Even if you see them as merely suggestions which are pointless to share when being in regards to things they already seem to be doing, you overlook the likelihood that your codific8ion of them as a somewhat cohesive prescription for understanding and something close to idealized behavior can be useful to ponder together. They're likely prioritized somewhat. Assessing the extent of ordered significance (and other characteristics) of the completed set is an undue frustr8ion when attempting to learn more from them (or about you, or both), as well as attempting to commit them to memory and interpret and implement them in any unified fashion.
Thank you Pip.   Many of your concerns and feelings -- I (also) have had myself.   I have had to work my way through them -- and find peace -- in spite of not being given all of the information that I have requested.   Why is this ?   He has told me bits and pieces of the answer to that -- but far from all that I have asked of Him.   This (quite apparently) is a part of getting to know Him.
What about getting to know you and your Points of Light? Why include #6 as Axioms that should be "light", but that you keep in the "dark"?
Very interesting questions.   Actually -- those are 2 questions which are nearly exactly the same questions I have asked of Him.
Hmm. Well I put forth that "getting to know Him" is already difficult enough if one (like me) finds little compelling evidence that He exists or wields any formidable powers or could be worth struggling to get to know. If He has good reasons for Axioms to exist in a numbered set (of 27), then they ought not be concealed or dealt out only when they are not being followed properly. Instead they should be published and explained somewhat comprehensively, so He (and you) can become better known and respected through them (after they prove they can stand up to scrutiny, challenge, and critique). This is how I see it. Maybe you can ask Him if there's at least some good reasons to withhold them?
I have asked Him.   And (over time) I have gotten a number of answers.   Some of His answers are very clear.   Others are a bit fuzzy.   Some of His answers sit well with me.   Some of His answers tend to wrinkle my nose from time to time.   I guess the bottom line (for me -- although I am fully aware that this certainly is not the case for everyone) -- the bottom line (for me) is that I believe that He is wiser than I am -- and when He withholds this or that from me -- I believe that His doing so is not only because of His greater wisdom (than mine) -- but also that He knows how to love me -- and is loving me -- much better than I could possibly love myself.
Ah. Hmm. Well then, if He is so wise and loving you better than you could love yourself, why would He withhold valuable answers from you when you probably love yourself better by allowing yourself to access answers from yourself without the need for obscurity and mystery? Are you only assuming or having unreasonable faith that He is more wise than you and loves you better? How do you come to such odd conclusions (which they seem to be to me, so far)?
Three (3) great questions.
    Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
For the first Q -- I have no answer.
To the 3rd Q -- my answer is that My Father (among many other things) is quite odd.
To the 2nd Q -- the answer to this one can not be absolute.   It would always end up being a matter of one's opinion -- and different people would probably suggest many different answers.
Okay. Well I think inability or unwillingness to answer important questions about proper behavior and wisdom-seeking indic8s that your Father is not a good Teacher and not particularly deserving of respect or high regard. This type of responsiveness seems to me to be evidence of His conspicuous lack of inform8ion or dishonorable secrecy, which you're just expected to explain away as somehow more "wise" and "loving" while He exhibits less of these than you probably mostly already do for yourself. You seem to have lived the vast majority of your life faithful and loyal to Him, but your reward for this seems to be keeping you essentially in the dark about significant issues. I think He is a failure, if He can't answer sincere questions by His devout followers. Might you please be able to explain why you seem to be assuming that Him not answering you is exhibiting gr8r wisdom, as opposed to less of it?
Thank you for all of your comments and observations in that paragraph.
And now -- about the question ...
You're welcome.
Yes -- I believe I am able to explain it.
But I highly suspect that it would not be an "explanation" which you would be able to embrace.
Do you want me to send it anyway ?
Yes, please.
Ok.
Here goes.
There is a verse in Scripture (Rom 12:3) -- which says:  "Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought."   ¬∂   And -- this does apply to many of us -- at various times in our journey.   ¬∂   However.   It is my experience -- that the vast number of people that I have come across (in the past 77 years) -- have the very opposite problem -- which is:  they think of their "self" far (far) far! more lowly than they ought !!!   ¬∂   That is -- they either have no clue as to who (or what) they are -- or -- they refuse to eat the very truth of it -- for one or another of various different reasons (which I will not list at this moment -- but I could)   ¬∂   And -- along that same line -- I would add this:  Philippians 2:5 says: "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ (Yeshua)."   And then (in the very next verse) -- it goes on to explain that the reason that you are to embrace the idea of your having the mind of Christ is:  because you (just like Yeshua) are equal with/to God.   ¬∂   And here is the gigantic reason that Our Father ofttimes does not "flat-out" answer our questions.   He wants us to realize that His ability to "figure things out for His self" -- is resident within us.   And thereby -- the more that He "makes us" (leaves us to) "figure things out for our self" -- the more (and more) we become aware that He (and each of we) are One.
 
And -- in case you would like the links -- they are:
 
https://biblehub.com/romans/12-3.htm
https://biblehub.com/philippians/2.htm
I know this is a nit-pick, but it struck me when trying to process what you've written here that: If "you are to embrace the idea of your having the mind of Christ", then unless Christ had in mind the idea of having His own mind, your mental "embracing the idea" prohibits you from having His mind. We are not equal with/to God. His mind is supposedly vast and perfect, and ours seem to almost always exhibit simplicity and flaws. Okay, now I'm moving on to "the gigantic reason" sentence.
So regarding this gigantic reason, wanting us to "realize" that us figuring things out is somehow "His ability... for His self", but how is this? Even assuming we're equal with/to God, if He remains distinct from us in any way, then we are not Him, He is not us, and thus us figuring things out is not Him doing so but primarily just us. I think there might be some minor ways in which we can be said to be "One", but in most ways, no, we are 2 or 3 different beings, entities, life-forms, etc., and not best understood to be merely "One".
And that is where you are right now.
And I applaud it.
You are perfect Philip.
üòä
I don't think I'm perfect. I also insist that I'm not equal with/to God. He and I are not "One". He has a "Chosen People", collects fore-skins from new-born baby boy's genitals, commands his people to commit genocide on heathen goyim, and instructs his people on how to properly keep slaves, handle rape, atone for sins only and always by spilling blood (including human), claims He is impossible to please without gr8 unreasonable faith, and many further atrocities. He seems overwhelmingly terrible and unethical. I am mostly good, and appear to hold higher values than Him in many regards. Maybe I'm somewhat close to perfect, while God was not and is not.
And -- you wish to "stick" to that ?
"Stick to" what?
All of those statements, ideas, conclusions, and evaluations ?
If they're mostly correct, then: "Yes!" Is there any reason I shouldn't?
Yes -- there is a reason.
You want I should "pick it apart" ?
Please.
Ok.
Here goes.
(A)  You don't believe you are perfect.  ‚Ä¢  I shall leave that one go for today.  (B)  Not God's equal  ‚Ä¢  I'll suspend comments on that one too (for now)  (C)  You and He not One.  ‚Ä¢  Can w8 too.  Now (D)  Chosen People  (E)  fore-skins  (F)  genocide  (G)  keep slaves  (H)  handle rape  (I)  sin atonement  (J)  blood spilling  (K)  many further atrocities.  ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  All 8 of these are Old Testament stuff.   And He does not support these any longer.   ¬∂   Yeshua has come to say (and show) a new way -- a New Testament  (a new system)  (a new way of being, doing, and believing) -- which are un-terrible -- and quite ethical -- very good -- and holding extremely high values -- for each (and every) one of His children.
Did you perhaps miss the part of the Old Testament where all that "stuff" was part of an "eternal covenant" with His "Chosen People" though? Jews still exist and mostly reject Y'shua for good reasons. Also Y'shua was supposedly a faultless blameless human blood sacrifice for atonement in your New Testament, which indic8s He didn't deserve to suffer and die while all of us others who are presumed to be God's children would deserve punishment but can be exoner8d just by believing Y'shua paid our penalties. This may be gr8 mercy in some sense, but I am inclined to consider justice and fairness to be higher values than those (whenever feasible, and with God they should be superior options He could have chosen). Further, Christians and even just Westerners still routinely remove new-borns' fore-skins, still believe in supposedly the same God who earlier condoned and endorsed slavery and rapists marrying their victims. If God's character and values can change so drastically from Old to New Testaments, how can you have any confidence it hasn't changed much more than before over the past 2000-or-so years? I think tons of what Christians have done throughout these past couple millennia has continue in terrible traditions, primarily by honoring hopes and faith as the basis for beliefs instead of requiring evidence and good sound reasons. Crusades, Inquisitions, persecutions, fragment8ion into incompatible denomin8ions, prohibitions against scientific findings, apologetics which almost ubiquitously presume the Bible is entirely true and trustworthy, etc.. The New Testament still gave rise to a gr8 deal of terrible activities -- unethical -- not good -- ongoingly poor values -- for each who are indoctrin8d or become otherwise convinced that they are one of God's children, while unbelievers are brow-beaten that they're going to burn in Hell for eternity. I think you're trying to paint to rosy a picture there.
s/those/mercy/; s/continue/continued/;
s/paint to rosy/paint too rosy/;
Well -- I must admit --
               God has given me a pretty rosy life.
Shall I ask Him to send you some daffodils ?
                    Mom too -- come to think of it.
Go ahead. If they arrive somehow, I guess I'll try to put them in water or wine or something.  üòâ
Whine ?
Do flowers do well in blood, or wine, or grape-juice best?  üòâ
I think so.
I did knot major in botany.
I was a microphone major.
With a microchip minor.
Right on.
üòä
Well shall we call it a night and look forward again to chatting more next Friday night on Sept. 18th?
It's a knight.
I ‚ù§
you Dad, and hope you have a good week ahead. Thanks very much for the deep topics we got into tonight.  üòä
And that sound like a plan.
And thank you for this evening.
And I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
K9BMNrad
I'll have a goood week if you have a goood week.
Fri Sep 11 23:53:36:39 -0500 2020
Thank you so much.
You're welcome. Thank you again too.

KB7LJbcv:Copy from over a week ago:
  I appreciate you Pip.
In what way?
How much time do you have ?
This may take several hours to answer that !!
Don't know. Probably not several hours.
     Well ok.   I'll just start with a few.
If you get tired -- we can continue later.
And for the rest of our lives too.
What do I appreciate about you ?
I like chatting with you.
You have an exquisite mind.
Quite polished.
And expanding constantly.
Not many other people that I know are in that same department.
I cherish that about you.
You are kind.
You are truthful.
You are multi-faceted.
You are interesting.
You are polite.
You appreciate quality.
I love your hugs.
I like your smile.
I like your style.
I hope we'll be friends
for a long long while.
Thanks for those. I'm also challenged to define "friendship" for now. We'll see.
Ah yes -- fri-end-ship.
Well -- the "ship" suffix is way of saying "together".
It is very similar to using a "co" or "con" prefix on a word.
Means "together".
The "fri" on the front of the word "friendship" --
comes from the French "fr√®re" --
and it means "brother".
Of course the "end" in "fri-end-ship" is a no-brainer.
It means "till the end" -- which implies "forever".
So -- a "friend" (fri-end) -- is a "brother-forever".
And the "friendship" is signifying that they "sail" (travel) together.
     It's a neat word.
I like it.
üòä
But --
not nearly as much as --
     I like you.
üòä
I suspect few (if any) things are forever.
Hmm.
Another curious comment.
As I was reviewing our "last weekend" chats -- I was seeing in your comments (there) that you tend to (strongly) lean toward a belief in "forever".
Was I wrong ?
I have serious doubts this week.
Why so ?
Not sure old view can work. Well I think I am getting pretty tired now. Can we please maybe try again next week?
Sure.
Thanks.
I can easily save my PCA for then.
You are welcome Philip.
Thank you for tonight.
Maybe short -- but I enjoy you --
short or tall.
I hope you have a gooder week -- this coming.
I shall look for you on Fri Nov 06 2020 - 2000 G / 1900 P.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks. Hope you have a good week too and maybe I'll look for you also, on Nov. 6th.
You're welcome.
Great.   Thank you Pip.

Hi Dad.
5'11-06-20 - 2005 Gtime / 1905 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
And how was your week ?
Good Evening to you too Dad.
My week has been challenging, but still pretty good too.
How was your week?
Pretty good too -- with some interesting challenges also.
Want to tell me about yours ?
Well the big issues for me were my landlord, Doug, trying to force me to move into another property that he manages. I've resisted that.
Hmm.
Go on please.
I've also gotten sober, staying off both THC (Marijuana) and Amphetamines. I'm planning to stay off them and Alcohol, etc. for good.
Wow !!
Probably just legal caffeine and nicotine for me ahead.
What brought you to that ?
Long story.
I've got time.
I have an appointment on Wednesday afternoon --
A lot of medit8ion and thought about cost / benefit analysis basically.
but -- for the next 3¬Ω days -- I'm all yours.
üòä
Nope -- make that 4¬Ω !!
I don't feel like getting into to much of the thinking right now. Maybe another time.
s/ to / too /;
That's ok.
I'm happy for you.
Are you happy about it ?
Thanks. Yes, I'm happy about it, and optimistic that it will lead to better opportunities to move back to SoCal hopefully next Summer. Care to tell me about what was challenging for your week?
Thank you for being so kind and patient with me last week. I was having an even more rough time back then. I appreC8 you.  üòä
I've been trying to clean up some programs on Tera.   Both DOS batch programs & QBASIC program.   I've been writing various programs for about 50¬Ω years now.
Cool.
Please feel free to e-mail me any code you write that you're proud of, or at least satisfied with. I'd like to see what you've written.
And -- not all of the ones I still want to use these days are able to be used on my current operating system without some necessary tweaking.
Octology on GitHub is usually where you can find much of my best.
Yep.   That is your pearl.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks Dad. I ‚ù§
you too.
You are an Xcellent programmer.
Thank you.
üòä
I'm so glad this past week went better than your previous one.
Me too.
Being patient with you (and others) gets easier -- the older I get.
It looks like I'm going to be switching some of my Supplementary insurance in January to a new AARP plan which should cover vision and dental, thankfully. It will be gr8 to get new glasses and my teeth cleaned after a decade of them both deterior8ing.
It comes from reflecting on all of my failures of the past 77 years -- and realizing that I was not always patient with myself.
And that was unkind of me -- to me.
So -- now that I have learned to be kinder (and more patient) with me -- it (naturally) follows that I (also) have more ability to be so with others.
And (of course) you are my fave.
üòä
AARP ?
But you are only 43¬Ω !!
I'm not sure what it stands for.
Just over a month away from 44 now.
Apparently old enough to qualify for better plans.
The "RP" is "Retired Persons".
Maybe American AssoC8ion?
Yep.   But my Gchat only accepts  ¬º  and  ¬Ω .   I doesn't have an ASCII char for 3/4.
Well -- if AARP will let you in at 43.9 -- I say:  good for them -- and good for you.
Teeth & eyes service is a good thing.
I applaud you.
Thanks.
You're welcome Pip.
So is anything on your PCA for tonight?
Just 2 -- but I'm in no hurry.
I just have 1 item for now. No hurry on my side either though.
I'm just enjoying you and your week right now.
Cool. Yeah, I am a bit tired, but would like to try to stay awake for a while longer to chat with you.
Me too.
I've been looking forward to chatting with you all week.
Me too.
With you.
Thinking about you a lot.
Nice.
Yes.   It is.
It is sweet to think about you Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
I ‚ù§
you too.
Thank you Pip.
You're so nice !!
Would it be okay if we take a 10 - 15 minute break from chatting so I could go smoke a cigar in my living room and return to chatting with you after that?
Sure.   Which one tonight ?
Cheyenne Sweet Mint.
lol
Ok.
E  n  j  o  y
Thanks. Yeah, I'll message you again when I'm back in my computer room and ready to chat further. Should be pretty soon.  üòä
See you in about 10 or 15.
5'11-06-20 - 2044 Gtime / 1944 Ptime
I'm back. I think I'm a bit too tired to keep chatting more tonight. Can we please plan to chat again further tomorrow night at 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime?
I ‚ù§
you.
Hope you have a good night and good Sabbath.
Sure.
The mint was the green wrapper -- yes ?
Thank you for this chat Pip.
You have a grreat evening (and Saturday) too please.
I shall look for you Sat Nov 07 2020 - 2000 G / 1900 P.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
G'night.
5'11-06-20 - 2103 Gtime / 2003 Ptime
KB7LIxed
Good Evening Dad.
6'11-07-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
And how was your Shabbat ?
Restful. How was yours?
Restful is good.
Not sure.   Let me look.   BRB.
Ah yes.
I looked.
It was:
     researchful.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Yes ?
You wanted to say ?
I watched a gr8 3-hour interview by Lex Fridman of Eric Weinstein at: HTTPS://YouTu.be/o2nG7-eXxko
It was about ?
Maybe you can get a chance to watch it too and will like it also. Lots of topics touched on.
The title is: "Eric Weinstein: On the Nature of Good and Evil, Genius and Madness | Lex Fridman Podcast #134"
Ah yes.
Eric -- the wise turtle.
Indeed.
Did you wish to make any comments on what he said ?
Well I don't seem to share the same pessimism as "Meta-Eric" and lean toward the willingness to try new things with slight hope of success like "Regular-Eric".
I am not sure I understand that.
Are you saying that you DO lean toward the willingness to try new things -- with a hope of success ?
Yes.
And Eric doesn't ?
"Meta-Eric" doesn't seem to.
Does he say why he doesn't ?
Not exactly. It's implied that he's too realistic or pragmatic and thus more pessimistic I think.
Ah so.
And your viewpoint on that matter ?
Trying new things is good, even if most attempts are overly ambitious and bound to fail.
Why are "most" attempts overly "A" and bound to "F" ?
Because they haven't been tried before.
Hmm.
But is not an attempt at anything -- always a success --
at learning something from it ?
Can be. It's usually a good way to look at attempts I think.
I do.
Even if an attempt at something -- results in a failure to achieve the desired goal -- I still learn something (from it) to assist me in making my next attempt:  more centered in on the target -- yes ?
Yes.
What is the concept of "Meta-Eric" ?   Why that name ?
He uses it. Watch and listen. I can't explain it better than I already have.
Ok.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You said last evening that you had 1 item on your PCA.
Did you wish to get into that now ?
Okay.
Okay.
You have my ears.
I have a plan to hand-craft a custom calendar for you for 2021 but I will need a printer (at least black-and-white with network interface, probably Hewlett Packard would be a good choice). Is there any chance you might be able to afford to purchase me one before December, since I can't afford to do so myself yet?
Do you have a model in mind ?
Not yet. Probably any HP with network-interface should suffice. Inkjet or Laser. Whatever.
I can do research and provide you specs if you'd like, probably via e-mail before next Friday.
Sounds like a good idea.
Thank you.
Cool. Will do. Thank you too!
You're welcome.   I look forward to your determination.
What is a printer "with network-interface" ?
One that can get it's own local IP-address via DHCP and then can be accessed via the LAN.
I don't think I understand that.
Not just hooked up via a parallel port or USB. Connects via Ethernet.
A printer like that does what -- that other printers do not do ?
Connects via Ethernet.
I'm sorry.   My ignorance is showing.
I don't think my printer is connected via Ethernet.
But it prints whatever I want it to.
Right. Most these days probably connect via USB. I'd rather have one on my network instead.
What am I not getting from it that I could otherwise have ?
Yes -- mine is USB connected.
It's easier for any machine on your Local-Area-Network to print to a centralized printer if it's connected via Ethernet instead of just USB off one of your machines.
I don't think I have a Local-Area-Network -- do I ?
Probably not. I always do though, to keep most of my machines connected through a Gigabit-Ethernet Switch, so I can easily login to any other machine over the network instead of requiring direct oper8ion.
I alloc8 static IP-addresses for each machine. I can show you my /etc/hosts file if you'd like to see my current mapping, for reference and example.
Are you saying that you are connected to your printer "wirelessly" via a LAN ?
Would you like me to paste it here for you?
Not exactly. Actually I prefer "wired" but "wireless" would probably be an option too.

You can see the local IP-addresses along the left side with them each followed by the machine interface name, then comments after the hash showing MAC and other details. It formats best in fixed-width font of course.
Thank you.
You're welcome. I've configured the DHCP server on my NetGear CableModem/Router to alloc8 these addresses for the detectable MAC's.
I'm sorry.   That ball went "out-of-the-park".   My mind cannot reach it.
But I still look forward to your email about the printer that you have your eye on.
Okay. I will probably research it and send you a link tomorrow (Sunday).
Anytime before next Friday is fine.
Thank you Pip.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
You are welcome also.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I love you too Dad.

Shall we talk about "The Election" ?
Okay. I didn't follow it. I don't have or watch regular TV. But go ahead and say whatever you'd like to about it.
I do not have (or watch) regular TV either.
Are you aware of the results ?
I caught a glimpse of a Twitter Tweet I think it was, on my phone, suggesting that Biden was leading in the vote counts. Didn't follow up on it though, so not sure if that's still the case.
Yes.   As of yesterday (Fri Nov 6 2020) morning -- there were still 6 states that were "in question" -- and at that time -- I made a projection (to myself).
Ah.
Interesting that the number might be exactly inverted like that.
Yes -- I thought so too.
And this morning (Sat Nov 7 2020) Pennsylvania got done their counting -- and their 20 gave Biden a total of 273 -- which was (finally) 3 more than he needed to win the new Presidency.
So -- I guess my question to you is:
             How do you feel about the outcome ?
I suspect that Trump remaining in office would have been slightly better for the upcoming 4 years than Biden getting in there, but maybe he'll be better than I'm guessing.
I guess I'm a little disappointed, but hopefully Biden will do a decent job and not screw anything up too badly.
lol
I hope so too.
üòä
Thank you.
The voter turnout was a record-breaker this year too.
I found that (also) to be interesting.
A turnout of greater than 60% has only happened 3 times before in our history.
In 1952, 1960, and 1968.
And the highest was in 1960  (62.8%) when John Kennedy was elected.
This year's turnout exceeded that -- with a 66.4% !!
Wow! Real close to 2/3rds.
The math of stuff always intrigues me.
Often for me too.
Yep.   Nearly 2/3.
As a kid -- I was never (really) into sports -- that is "to play them".   But I was (very) into the baseball stats of "how many games out of First-Place" each teams was -- day by day.
I loved (and still love) math.
Cool. Me too usually.
Well I'd like to take a smoke break out in my living room for about 15 minutes. Would that be okay? I should be back to chat more before 9pm Ptime / 10pm Gtime.
Sure.   What color this time ?
Red / Wild Cherry flavor.
Ah yes.
Red tonight.
Green last night.
Sounds like Christmas to me.
See you in about 15.
     E  n  j  o  y
I usually rot8 through my favorite 6 flavors: Pink / Strawberry, Red / Wild Cherry, Orange / Peach, Yellow / Vanilla, Green / Sweet Mint, and Blue / Xotic Berry.
Be back in a bit.  üòä
Ok Pip.
6'11-07-20 - 2143 Gtime / 2043 Ptime
I'm back.
Feel free to go ahead with your PCA items whenever you're ready.
Hello there "back".
Thank you.
üòä
üòä
Whoops.  I said only 3 times before this
year was voter-turnout above 60%.  Not
correct.  It was 4 times.  In 1964 also.
 
Sorry.
Ok -- thank you.
2 more items on my PCA for tonight.
One is weather.
Weather here has been quite nice the past 3 days (that I've remained sober for).
Xcellent Pip.
Just caffeine and nicotine for me now. I'm steering clear of the illegal stuff.
Good for you.
I'm so elated.
Yesterday was absolutely specTACular weather here too.
     A real "San Luis" day.
Zero clouds.
Bee-you-tiful blue.
And a high in the low 70s.
And today was a carbon copy too.
Temp (in the sun) today went up to 128¬∞.
In fact -- today was our 4th day with a high in the 70s.
And -- we are expecting 3 more days of the same too.
      I'm a happy camper.
Nice. I'm glad you're enjoying the weather so much.
Me too.   Thank you.
Ready for my other PCA ?
Yep.
Ok.     Here comes.
 
This past week was quite good.
 
The week before (which we had not gotten
a chance to chat about last weekend) was
even gooder.
 
I (SO) want to thank you for our Saturday
evening chat -- 2 weeks ago. 
You're welcome.
 
Truly a valuable one.  At least so very
much so for me.
 
I shall not comment on each facet of it
-- but one item was especially of great
satisfaction to me.
 
At 2335 Gtime (Sat Oct 24 2020) -- you
declined our offer to become FTR's Narrator. 
  
              And I thank you for that.
 
I must admit that for most of Sunday (the 25th)
-- there was a degree of sadness to it -- as
(ever since in late October of 2017 -- when
we first opened the idea to you) I thought
it would be a quadruple good development.
 
      #1  Good for you.
      #2  Good for our company.
      #3  Good for our students.
      #4  Good for our (yours & my) enjoyment of each other.
 
So.  At first -- there was a "sadness"
to your decision.  But that did not last.
 
I realized quite soon -- that you have been
leaning away from its doing -- for a long time
now -- and it was good to finally hear you say
it so clearly.
 
       I thank you so much.  :)
 
My Father and I chatted quite a bit over the
weekend about this.  And with each exchange
in our conversation -- the sadness just melted
away.
You're welcome. Yeah, I don't like the idea of putting my voice to "God" stuff and "Think and Grow Rich" things that I don't really believe in.
 
              ON NUMBER 2
 
      #2  Good for our company.
 
He reminded me about the fact that (#2) -- the
company did not "belong" to me.  And that I was
not the "boss" of it. 
 
And also: how (‚Ä¢) its structure (‚Ä¢) its rules
(‚Ä¢) its Scripts (‚Ä¢) its methods of operation
-- as well as (‚Ä¢) its personnel -- are not
decisions for me to be making.
 
Although He has appointed me to be the (visible)
"Front Man" -- He is still the real boss of the
operation.
 
I am not even an employee.  I am merely a volunteer
-- and this is not to imply "a power" -- but more
(actually) "a privilege".
 
And -- He went on to remind me of a (rather liberal)
handful of things that He has shared with me over
the years -- the prime of which was:
 
Piece of Light #5b: There are no accidents in my universe.
 
    This (of course) comes straight out of Romans 8:28 --
    which says: "And we know that all things work together
    for good, to them that love God, to them who are the
    called according to His purpose."
Just because you and your "Father" don't seem willing to admit there are accidents in "your" universe doesn't mean there aren't any.
 
    As I (this weekend) meditated on this verse (for probably
    the umpteenth time in the past 50 years) -- Sis focused
    me in on a number of key words -- and terms.
 
        know
        all things
        good
 
        called
        His purpose
 
Yes.  Again -- I was reminded that FTR was not a "purpose"
of mine.  It was (and is) a purpose of His.
 
This means that I do not have to manage it.  I do not have
to design it.  I do not have construct it.  I do not have
to control it.  And -- how it turns out -- or the good that
it does (or does not) produce in the lives of its students
-- is neither "up to me" -- nor shall I be held accountable
for what the FTR company may happen to fail to do.
 
That stuff is all: up to Him.  He is the CEO.  And even the
owner of the company does not get to advise Him on any part
of it either.
 
Hmm.  I said that was going to be about #2.
           But --- I guess it was also about #3.
 
                #2  Good for our company.
                #3  Good for our students.
 
He then moved on to NUMBER 4.
 
              #4  Good for our (yours & my) enjoyment of each other.
 
About which he said: 
 
    "Whether Philip is an active part of the FTR company
     or not -- need not be a factor at all in your continued
     enjoyment of each other.  The only 2 things that that
     is dependent on is:  (1) Do you want it to continue ?
     And:  (2) Does he want it to continue ?"
 
And -- at that -- I had to smile. 
       Of course -- He was right.
 
FTR has nothing to do with our
continued enjoyment of each other.
I do want us to continue to enjoy each other, when we can.
 
Bottom line:
 
       By mid-day on Sunday -- I was 99% fine with your
       decision to opt-out of the Narration Position.
Yeah, I too am glad FtR isn't essential for us to rel8 together.
 
    Why only 99% ?
 
Because -- we still need a narrator -- don't we ?
 
    Which (to my question) He responded:
 
       "Of course we do -- but My problem -- not yours."
 
Again -- I smiled. 
 
Sup to Him.  All of it.
 
Anyway.  I said all that -- to say this:
 
         Thank you Pip.
 
And now -- I (also) finally know why I purchased the
Shure SM58 Microphone (and its auxiliary equipment)
back in February of 2018 -- and began to put together
the packages and letter in March of 2020 -- but never
sent it to you.
You're welcome.
 
In my Father's time -- all is revealed to me.
 
I'm a happy camper.
  
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
 
(//)
Cool. Well I think I'm about ready to go to sleep.
Thanks for chatting again tonight.
I ‚ù§
you too.
I'll probably e-mail you about the printer tomorrow or certainly before next Friday, when we can hopefully chat again at our usual time.
Thank you for tonight's chat too Pip.
Thank you for your love.
You're welcome.
KB7LLS88
I hope you are Darjee have a good evening & a good week.
Thanks. We hope you do too.
Thank you.
And good luck on your continued sobriety also.
Thanks. I'll let you know how it goes.
Good.   Thank you.   Please do.
I shall look for you on Friday The 13th.
Yep. Hope to see you online then.
üòä
Good night.
6'11-07-20 - 2231 Gtime / 2131 Ptime
6'11-07-20 - 2233 Gtime / 2133 Ptime
Hi Dad. Sorry I am a bit l8 tonight. I fell asleep after Medication Observation. Maybe we'll need to just re-schedule for tomorrow or another evening instead?
KBDLLBDK
KBELCUTE
Hi Dad?
6'11-14-20 - 1330 Gtime / 1230 Ptime
All is fore-given.
How are you today? Sorry I was asleep last night, around our usual chat time.
Sorry be not.
All is perfect.
You are perfect.
The imperfect is part of "all" though.
There are no accidents in my universe.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I think there must remain accidents in your (and every possible) universe too.
Is my love an accident ?
That's precisely why there is such a word.
It might be.
This conversation is over !!
It is?
Why?
Call back when you agree with everything I've ever said.
Impossible. Of course it must be.
You've said things that are quite disagreeable before.
Everything you have ever said is perfect --
I disagree.
and absolutely correct.
This conversation is NOT over.
I've made at least typographical errors before. Those (and many other things) I've "said" were *not* perfect.
It shall continue forever.
I love chatting with you.
Maybe just a long time. Probably not forever.
Thanks Dad. I at least often like chatting with you too.
You are my favorite chattee on earth.
lol
üòä
There are probably better chattees than me... but maybe it's fortun8 for me that you're not acquainted with them yet.  üòâ
Oh yeah ?
So says you.
I say you are the best !!
And that settles it.
I have spoken.
üòä
          What ?
      No reply to that ?
Hmm.
I think I have a reply. I'm mulling it over.
Hmm back at you.
Take your time.
           I'm here.
I just had to rE-rEad all that we just typed to each other, just to remind myself of each exchange.
Ok.
Okay, so you say (or more precisely "type" and "write") that I am the "best". That may indeed settle it for you.
Fair enough.
However, as far as I'm concerned, I'd strongly expect that Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and at least Eric Weinstein also would be better chat partners than I in many cases and ways.
Your last 2 comments are fair also.
Maybe for you -- but not for me.
That's possible.
Even plausible.
I prefer you and Angie.
And Amanda & Katy.
Would you like me to try to turn on my camera and microphone during this chat, so that you could at least see me again somewhat and probably hear mostly my music (which is up quite loud right now, and hopefully you can enjoy hearing along with me), even if my voice is mostly drowned out by it?
Do you have any regular convers8ions with Angie, Amanda, or Katy?
I'm trying to initE8 the video portion of the chat.
I shall try again.
Gerry missed a call from you
11/14/20, 12:43 PM
Frequently -- yes.
Do you write them hand-written letters or chat with them online somehow? How frequently are such discussions between you and each of them?
Gerry missed a call from you
11/14/20, 12:45 PM
They have declined online recently.
I've tried to video-call you twice, but you seemed unable to pick-up either. Please let me know if you'd like me to try again. I'm willing to share video and audio with you again today, if you'd like to receive them.
But I hand-write.
Interesting. I'm glad you are able to maintain some contact with each of them. Hopefully it is sufficiently worthwhile and enriching for all parties.
I tried to "pickup" both of your video calls --
but didn't work.
Ah. Okay. Let me try again then.
Hmm. Maybe you can try to initE8 the call, if you can't answer my attempts to connect that way? Maybe I can accept your connection instead.
Gerry missed a call from you
11/14/20, 12:48 PM
The "answer" seemed to work -- but the "join" did not.
Same as on the first 2 tries.
It's not important.
Ah well. We tried 3 times.
      I remember what you look like.
üòä
Hopefully we can get it to work again another time.  üòä
      Ah ha.
A prayer.
I'm listening to a pretty huge Obsidia play-list on shuffle right now. The last song was: "Desolate" and now "Different" is playing, in case you want to search for them on YouTube and hear something like what I'm immersed in sonically.
I don't think a hope is exactly the same as, or even sufficiently akin to, a prayer.
I love the sound of your voice.
There may be some noteworthy similarities and overlap, but they certainly seem to me to contain critical distinctions.
It is music to my ears, my heart, and my mind.
                 I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Nice. Thanks Dad. I ‚ù§
you too. You should be able to hear some of my voice on my PipStuart YouTube channel whenever you wish to.  üòä
One of the Lessons in the PCA for Stanford is:
I intend to start 3 new YouTube channels over the next 3 months. Maybe you'll become able to hear and see even more of me if I get those rolling soon.
            Every Hope is a Prayer.
But my stus only get that one -- when they ask for it.
Please feel free to explain to me why there is no distinction to you between hopes and prayers then.
Send me your 3 URLs please -- when you get them up-and-running.
üòä
I will. Thank you for showing interest in them.
Always.
Everything about you --
            interests me.
You're welcome.
You said:
Please feel free to explain to me why there is no distinction to you between hopes and prayers then.
The first one should come up within the next month, probably under the new account title and channel name: "PedanticPip". The second will be a female persona I intend to develop called: "ClosedCaptionCratic". The third should come together somewhat next year as: "LLL" but I'll w8 to tell you what those stand for. She will be female too.
Did you want a response to that now ?
Sure.
LLL ?
What is an "LLL" ?
Also, please feel free to clarify if, even assuming all hopes *are* prayers, are any prayers then not also hopes, or are they entirely synonymous to you?
Good query Pip.
I think I (kinda) see 2 questions there.
My new channels will all follow certain conventions (probably). PP will be my first new one, which is basically very much like normal me, PipStuart. CCC will be my second new one, a female persona. Then LLL should also be female and come together next year. I then have plans to focus on those 3 for a while before starting new male channels under JJ, GG, II, and RR. We'll see about those, if the first 3 turn out decent.
#1 - Are all hopes prayers ?
#2 - are all prayers hopes ?
Right.
Yes, those are my questions.
Thank you.
And if so, why and how?
The simple (and fully accurate) answer to #1 is:    yes.
The answer to #2 is:    no -- and that one is (a bit) more complex.
May I interject another rel8d question here: If all hopes are prayers, what about hopes of people who don't believe or have faith in any God or gods?
Why would the hopes of unbelievers be prayers in any meaningful way?
Ok.   We'll address the hottest first.
Who would unbelievers hopes be prayers to?
Maybe "unbelievers" needs a trailing apostrophe for possessiveness.
The word "prayer" (for most people) gets defined as an activity which involves some (unprovable) "guy in the sky" (or something.
Right.
So why doesn't it for you?
That is not accurate (really).
What in particular is (really) inaccur8 about it?
However -- if the speaker -- and the listener -- both "hold" that to be a part of the definition of "prayer" -- then -- that's fine (for them).
P.S. Obsidia "Charged" is playing for me now, if you want to listen to it too. It's one of my top favorites.
But my definition of "prayer" is deeper -- far more encompassing.
Who is the "listener" though, if the "Guy in the sky" is un-provable though?
I shall continue -- but I must re-read here first.
Go ahead. Take your time. Address anything in any order you wish. I can usually keep up with whatever direction you feel is most deserving of taking our convers8ion in.
P.S. Now "Cobra" is playing, which is my absolute top favorite Obsidia track. The best!
There are plenty of little insertions (above in this chat so far) -- which we may (or may not) also get back to.
But I shall continue (for now) on the one open at the moment.
That's fine. Proceed however you wish.
The words "pray" and "prayer" are words which show up in The Scriptures quite frequently.
And -- in each case -- in order to have any idea of what the writer is attempting to communicate to us -- we need to be holding some sort of a definition for the word ("pray") -- within our mind.
I shall hone in on just one place for now.
Okay.
I Thes 5:17
https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5.htm
This is a tough verse for many people.
It says:
     Pray without ceasing.
And -- of course -- every one who has ever readd that verse --
has said to themself:
I'll follow that link and rEad it in a moment, but I'd like to say one thing first about this one place you've chosen to hone in on for now. I am not alone in considering Scriptures to be inferior to Dictionaries when it comes to canonical definition searches.
                   How is that even possible ?!
The Scripture are not easy to eat / digest / understand /comprehend.
Right. That's why Dictionaries are preferable when looking for definitions. That's my point!
One of the big problems in The Bible is that the things that the writers are sharing with us -- come in (about) 11 or 12 different categories.
And -- the writer switches from one category to another very frequently -- and nearly always -- without any warning at all.
Even more reason why the Bible sucks for definitions.
Let's take I Thes 5:16 and 17 and 18 -- as an example.
Verse 16 appears to be a suggestion.
Some people might call it a command.
It sounds like a command to me.
But -- there are no commands in The Bible.
Only suggestions.
Yet -- that is another lesson -- for another time.
It also sounds impossible. Nobody can seriously rejoice, pray, and give thanks all 3 at all times (always, constantly, continually, without ceasing).
I Thes 5:16 is a suggestion -- Rejoice evermore.
You're serious in saying Biblical "Commandments" are not commands?
Now -- let's look at I Thes 5:18.
Why say "always" when meaning "evermore"? The latter word was unavailable for some stupid reason?
Don't say "constantly" when you mean "usually".
I Thes 5:18 is also a suggestion -- Say "thank you" for every thing.
What about "always", "without ceasing", and "in all circumstances" makes any sense to interpret as mere suggestions for only some occasions?
It's as if you don't understand any of those words, or something.
They mean things.
So -- when people read verses 16 and 18 -- they believe that Paul is giving us a "to do" list.   I bunch of suggestions -- that (he believes) we should incorporate into our life.
And -- I'll go along with that idea --
          for starters.
Please rE-rEad my interjecting questions first.
If you can stop yourself, please don't go along with that idea just yet.
Address my queries.
And -- not only are 16 and 18 suggestions from Paul.   So are --
verses 15 and 19 and 20 and 21 and 22.
So naturally -- we tend to think that verse 17 is also a suggestion.
But --
I don't. Those words are not for suggestions.
You're in denial about the meanings of words.
every time we read it (as if it is a suggestion from Paul) -- our head screams:
          How is that possible ?!
I was no different.
My head did that too.
Was I (truly) asking that question -- of someone that I hoped would supply me with an answer ?
Or -- was I just (really) making a comment (sort of) "into-the-air" ?  
More or less (really) a complaint.
Well -- I can't remember for sure -- when -- and which.
But -- in the beginning -- yes -- it was (really) a complaint.
I was "miffed" at Paul -- for saying something -- that I perceived to be:
               not possible.
But that was only from my first reading of that verse -- when I was a child --
up until around the age of 30 --
when I seriously wanted an answer to this thing.
Is it possible to pray without ceasing.
My first thinkery was --
that Paul believed that it was.
You're still a child when it comes to reading, as far as I can tell.
This did not help me a whole lot.
        But -- it was a starting place.
Paul was not available.
          So -- I decided to ask breathing skinsuits -- which were available.
Did I get any good answers ?
I did not.
As a side question: When might you become able to learn how to read what I type in response to what you've written, rather than remaining on your single-minded train-of-thought? It's very hard to have an unresponsive "convers8ion" with someone who cannot also read and react and respond in-line.
Did I ask "everyday" people AND clergy people too ?
I did.
Did any give me a plausible answer ?
None.
I grew tired of this trek.
I decided to take my question to my EWO.
EWO?
This was somewhere in the mid-1970s -- I believe.
Eternal World O-something?
What's EWO again?
I don't use that initialism.
You're probably the only person who does.
I sat down with my pen & paper -- and asked My Father:
Is it possible to "pray without ceasing" ?
No.
It's not.
Eternal Wise One.
You assume God is Eternal, Wise, and One. Probably wrong on all 3.
To my question -- He said:  "yes".
I replied:
    So Paul was not "out to lunch" ?
He said:
Correct -- Paul was not out to lunch.
üòä
I thought about this a bit.
My next question came.
How (how) / how -- is it possible to:  pray without ceasing ?
He told me to answer that question -- for myself.
What the fuck does "How (how) / how" mean?
Yes -- there -- on my paper.
He wanted me to mull.
Which I did.
10 -- 20 -- 30
years.
Yes.   We talked about it -- again and again -- during those times.
But -- after each session -- he sent me off to mull some more.
Finally -- I came back to Him and suggested:
15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 -- those verses from Paul are suggesting:
       things to do -- things to incorporate into my life.
He said:  yes, they are.
And then I said:
        But -- I Thes 5:17 -- is NOT a command (a suggestion).
It is (instead) "a teaching" ?
He replied:   "Yes Gerry.   Now you've got it."
I Thes 5:17 is not telling us "something to do".
It is telling us something that IS.
Ok.
I'll take a break here.
Your turn Pip.
(//)
What are your definitions for the words: "command" and "suggestion"? You seem utterly insane to say "Make sure that...", "... always", "... without ceasing", "... in all circumstances", etc. are not "commands", but somehow merely suggestions or teachings. You hardly demonstr8 any capacity for using language logically.
Please go ahead and rE-rEad everything we've both written above, then reply to as many of my questions and comments as you're able to.
Ok.
Be back shortly.   I am re-reading -- as you have commanded me to do.
Fine. I will attempt to remain as p8ient as I can. RE-rEad as many times as you feel could be worthwhile, and mull whatever until you feel ready to respond to any aspect of it. I can attend to other things (like checking my bank balance and enjoying my Obsidia music with "Triad" playing now) until you seem ready to rE-eNgAge with our convers8ion again.
Ok.   I've done as you have instructed.
        I re-readd it all.
What would you like to discuss next ?
Please rE-rEad everything we've written today at least one more time through, then pick any of my above questions or comments to respond to. Take your pick.
Why continue on these ?  
You have been very clear.
Each answer I gave to your various questions to me -- was only rejected by you --or (in many cases) -- simply made you angry.  
I do not wish to upset you Pip.  
Can't we talk about something that is more pleasant ?
Just as a head's up, I plan to try to call Danny around 4PM my time (2PM Dtime / 1700 Gtime) and I'd like to be free to chat with him rel8ively undisrupted, so hopefully you and I can wrap up this chat session before then, and maybe re-convene around our usual time (1900 Ptime / 2000 Gtime) this evening if you're willing to continue any of our discussion around that time tonight?
Ah, okay.
Sure. I did get a bit angry a few times, but no big deal. I kinda like getting angry sometimes. I think it's good for the circul8ion!  üòâ
Any suggestions on more pleasant topics you'd like to delve into?
Sure.   A Danny chat sounds great.   Just let me know when.
üòä
I'm glad you circulation system is working.
             You're welcome.
I will let you know probably around 3:45PM my time when I'd like to suspend whatever we get into for a bit over the upcoming hour.
/you/   /your/
Me too. Circul8ion is usually gr8!  üòä
Thanks Dad. I love you too.
That's a beautiful image.
The "i" should probably be capitalized, but otherwise gr8.  üòâ
You're welcome.
üòä
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Are there any other items on your PCA for today, or would you like me to bring up one of the two I have for today / tonight?
I only have 2 -- but they can w8.
     You go first Pip.
Okay. Have you looked into the link I sent you for the HP P4015N networked LaserJet printer and considered whether you might be able to help me afford to purchase it? I would be much better off to have it, and I'd very much like to use it to develop a very custom hand-written artful calendar for you before New Year's Day (if possible).
Ah ha.
That was 1 of the items on MY  PCA.
 
Thank you for your email about the printer.
 
However -- my funding it for you this
year appears to be a "no-can-do".
 
So -- I guess your hope to create a
custom calendar for me will probably
have to wait until next year or so.
 
But -- I thank you for the idea.
I appreciate it -- and you Pip.
You're welcome. Thank you for seriously considering it. If you find yourself able to assist me in purchasing it (or another quite like it) at any time ahead, please let me know. I could probably put it to very good use A.S.A.P.. I appreC8 you too Dad.
Ok.   You shall be solving this soon.
                 I believe.
And  -- the other item on your PCA ?
Ah, yes. Is there any chance you already have, or could please help me to attain, the street addresses for the following people: Uncle Bruce, Uncle Tony, brother Tim, Uncle Kip, Uncle Pat, Uncle Dan, Uncle Billy, and Uncle Joey? I would gr8ly like to become capable of writing each of them letters and maybe eventually also becoming able to afford to send them a few small gifts.
I shall address your comment first.
And then -- your question.
You said:
I would gr8ly like to become capable of writing each of them letters and maybe eventually also becoming able to afford to send them a few small gifts.
 Excellent ideas Pip.
I believe they would very much appreciate hearing from you.
Now -- about the addresses for each of them --
You mentioned 8.
I believe I have 2 of them.
However -- I may be able to find the other 6.
     --  with your help.
Gr8! Thanks so much. What may I do to best help?
Please verify (or correct) names -- and give me a city & state on each.
Bruce Mathews
Tony Mathews
Kip Lennon
Pat Lennon
Bill Lennon
Joey Lennon
Do you have (also) current addresses for Mom & Angie ?
And Aunt Nina ?
Tony is "Anthony Ivan Mathews". Kip might be "Kippy" although that could just be his common nick-name. Pat is probably "Patrick". Billy is probably "William". Joey is probably "Joseph". All of their st8s are probably either California or Missouri.
I don't have addresses for Mom, Angie, or Aunt Nina. Those could prove useful too, if you might be able to help me acquire them as well.
Oh, and also Uncle Dan is "William Danforth Lennon".
Ok.   So I'll "up" the requested list to 11 -- not 8.
Is Nina still "Woodard" ?
Sounds good. Thanks. 11 then. Yes, I'm pretty sure Nina remains "Woodard".
You're welcome.
Was that your last PCA for today ?
Yes. I guess I can add one more though, if you want me to get into it somewhat?
Ok.   #12 is ?
No, not a 12th person to add to the previous list. A new PCA item somewhat rel8d to what I already mentioned back towards the start of our convers8ion today.
Ok.   I'll hold at 11.
As I described, I'm planning to start a new YouTube channel soon under the moniker "PedanticPip" who takes every word of online content so seriously and methodically that he lets almost no misspoken word or contradictory thought slide. I think this persona would be very much like my normal self. The majority of our chat today regarding hopes being prayers is probably quite a good example of how meticulous and determined I can be when challenging all sorts of language usages.
My second persona and channel I wish to stand up, hopefully during December, is ClosedCaptionCratic who is a female character that is somewhat like PP but she only focuses on the Artifical-Intelligence Auto-Gener8d CC subtitling that appears on most YouTube content. She will be rather laser-focused on just what is actually said and what discrepancies there are between what the AI gener8d text contains. Both of these should enable me to react to all sorts of interesting ongoing on-line material in hopefully sometimes poignant and profound ways.
I could really use the Shure microphone to help with these activities, if you could still afford to part with it and send it to me anytime soon.
So what do you think of these 2 initial ideas for channels? Any advice or recommend8ions?
No ideas yet -- nor advice -- nor recommendations.
I'll mull -- and look forward to seeing them.
About the microphone -- I'll have to decline on that one.
Okay. Well yeah, please mull and feel free to message me via chat or e-mail whenever you might have an idea or suggestion.
Our Narrator will need it.
But -- thank you for asking.
That's fine. I know you'll need it for your eventual FtR narr8or. Yeah.
I have one more PCA item that I could bring up now, or l8r.
Can we reconvene at 2000 G / 1900 P ?
My Son has just given me a large project to work on.
Hopefully. I will try to stay awake and re-connect with you then.
Cool. Thanks!  üòä
You're welcome.
Thank you for this chat -- and the assignment.
üòä
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're welcome, for both.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
Have a great chat with Danny.
Look for you tonight.
Thanks. Have a gr8 afternoon and evening and I will look for you again probably at 7PM my time.
Thank you Pip.
Same to you.

Hi Dad.
6'11-14-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Hello Philip.
I enjoyed a very nice chat with Danny. He's doing pretty well. Has good projects and plans of his own.
He also was able to clone my GitHub Octology repository today, so I at least have one good off-site backup of the code and d8a now residing in California, just in case any calamity strikes me here at home in Oshkosh.
Glad to hear that.
Both.
I have made fairly good progress on your request.
Of the 11 -- I've got 7 so far.
Excellent! Thanks very much. I totally appreC8 your gr8 help with this.
Are we happy ?
Indeed.
üòä
Thank you Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
üòä
I ‚ù§
you too.
Thank you.
Along the way (in my research) found 2 pics too.
Cool.
Wanna see 'em ?
Yes please.
Ok.
See if you can identify this one:
Obviously Aunt Nina.
Give that man a cigar.
üòä
Heh. I *do* love a good cigar. Just had a nice Peach Cheyenne and am about to have a Vanilla one.
Good for you Pip.
Want to try for another one ?
Please.
Ok.   Who is this ?
Uncle Bruce looking pretty stern.
It 'tis.   It 'tis.  
Right on both counts.
He's not into the "grab-my-chin" position.
üòä
Hah. Yeah, I don't think "grab-my-chin" position would suit him so well.  üòâ
Right !!
Bruce is still in California.
Nina is in Colorado Springs -- a place I know well.
Cool.
Mom and I visited there in March of 1972 -- on our drive to Pennsylvania.
I hope to have the rest of your assigned project done before February.
Nice. Thanks. Anytime would be gr8.
How do I send you a data file through this chat thing ?
I don't know. Probably just attach it to an e-mail or copy and paste the text here instead.
            ok        we shall find a weigh
I'm going to test the "copy & paste" method here.

=======================================================
Yep, that works fine.
Good.
Will that serve your needs ?
     -- if I do it that way ?
It will.
Please proceed whenever you're ready to.
Ok.
Proceed to what ?
Proceed to copy and paste any others.
Naa.   I'll w8 till I have the whole doodad done.
Then you'll have it all -- in one single piece.
I can use any that you have already though. Please don't w8.
I'd rather connect with anyone possible, well before February.
Who would you like to write to first ?
My 7 Uncles, then probably also Cousin Gina, then maybe Aunt Nina, and then maybe Ange and Tim. Probably not Mom. I h8 her, and she h8s me.
Good.   I'll give you Mom's first.
               She does not hate you.
Oh yes she does.
It's mutual.
You guys just have a few issues to work through.
Way more than a few.
lol
             Ok.           I stand corrected.
I look forward to her incarcer8ion and hopefully also rapid deterior8ion and demise. I'll probably help bring about each, if I can. She's wicked. She's my primary enemy. I wish her the worst life could have to offer.
Well -- that's a mistake.
Which? What about it is a mistake?
But I don't know that you are ready for that lesson today.
Try me.
Ok.
The basic law is:
        That which I wish for others -- visits me first.
I don't believe that. Why should I?
It's certainly not anything like a "law".
You shouldn't.
              You are not up on that side of the mountain yet.
I'll take some time.
           It is not important tonight.
We can return to that subject in February.
üòä
I wish mostly good things for almost everyone. My moms and the Boxsteins probably all deserve prompt deaths though, as far as I can tell.
It might be important tonight. Why all this wanting to w8 until February for anything?
What is a "boxstein" ?
You misunderstood me.
I did not say that I will get your address list to you IN February.
I said:  BEFORE February.
The landlords in North Hollywood who stole almost all of my expensive belongings the first time I was forced into a mental hospital. They basically stole my ability to continue developing software professionally. They stole probably approxim8ly $20,000 worth of computer and game equipment from me. Their daughter tried to choke me. They are evil people.
Probably within the next 25 hours - in fact.
Ah ha.
So that is "a boxstein".
Gr8. Thanks... but you *did* just write "We can return to that subject in February" which would be *in* -- not *before*.
I'd like to meet them.
Yes.
You are correct.
On that -- I did say "in".
This is a poetic way of saying "later" --
I hope you only get to meet them at their funerals. I want justice and revenge for what they've done to me.
      and it further implies:    when you want it.
Okay. Well I want it now. How does wishing something for anyone visit me first as some kind of "law"?
Let us move away from the boxstein matter now please.
         It wrinkles your nose.
Okay. Let's move back to why wishing something for another should (according to you) become something which visits me first. Also, why is wishing my evil moms suffering and death a mistake?
Ok.
P.S. "Boxstein" is David and Edith's last name, which should probably be capitalized as a proper-noun.
I'll do the second one first.
Before her baby's birth -- a mother realizes that that baby is a separate being.
But -- it takes her a little while to fully fathom that.
After the child is delivered out into the air -- she knows the separateness to (truly) be so.
But -- the baby does not.
How do you know what a baby knows?
The child still holds on to the concept of their being one.
I doubt I did.
But -- in time -- even the child realizes that there is a disconnection -- in the visual realm.
I've never been "one" with my stupid ugly mom. From inception, I was my own man-in-the-making.
But -- the mother -- although she can mentally assent to their separation -- she never gets to the point that she becomes emotionally separated.
You don't know what points a mother never gets to.
Your Mother -- in Columbia -- lives with you every day.   And -- when you are in pain -- she also is in pain.
My mom and I have always been profoundly disconnected. She's evil and I almost never am.
You're wrong.
When you bring yourself to peace -- within you -- she will (also) finally also come to peace.
She has almost never felt pain when I have. You scarcely know either her or me.
Wrong again.
You do not have to wish suffering on Mom.
Your own lack of peace already does it.
When she is locked up for life, suffering, and hopefully soon dead... then I will come to some peace.
Please try to prove anything you're asserting here.
Physically -- your 2 bodies are separated.
But -- in truth -- it can never happen.
Now.
Maybe I don't "have to" wish suffering on Mom, but I still am pretty sure I retain good reasons for doing so. My own lack of peace does not already do it.
I did not read your comments -- as I was sharing what you had asked of me there.
You don't know truth.
But -- I shall go back now -- and do so.   Thank you for them.
Well then, as usual, please take your time to rE-rEad everything we've both written, then respond when you care to.
Ok.
Thank you.
Be back shortly.
I'm going to urin8. Be back in a couple minutes.
Back.
Good.
Welcome back
I have readd over all of your comments.
You have invited me to respond to any of them that I wish.
Yes.
This I cannot do.
You have clearly told me that everything I said was wrong.
And that settles it.
Everything I said was wrong.
Not everything.
(//)
You were right that I don't "have to" wish as I do. I do have reasons for doing so anyway.
If you think you know any of the things you asserted (without any substantial proof), please indic8 what else you know that contributes to the likelihood that any of your claims have merit.
None have merit.
If you just keep pronouncing things, as if they're adequ8 explan8ions or answers to questions, you're likely to continue to be met by me with incredulity and even some substantial hostility. You can't convince me of many things just by claiming them without evidence.
I'm loaded with opinions.
It's ok.
You asked for it.
I gave you what you asked for.
You rejected it.
It's ok with me.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Okay. Well thanks for your opinions then.
Not because you believe what I believe.
I love you because you are you.
If you back up your opinions with the reasons why you find them reasonable to hold, you'll get farther with me.
You are welcome for my opinions.
Thank you for the thanks for them.
üòä
So can you please provide me with the 7 addresses (of 11) you've found so far?
What's next young fellow ?
Nope.
Why not?
The file is a mess.
I don't care. I can clean messy files easily in seconds.
When I get the other 4 inserted -- I shall go in and clean it up -- and then send it to you.
Please send me the first 7 now (either via attachment to an e-mail, or copy and pasted in-line with this chat session here), and let me clean whatever I choose to for myself. Then feel free to send the remaining 4 whenever you find those too. I could use the majority of 7 almost right away.
Are you ready to mail a letter to someone now ?
Not exactly now, but l8r tonight or tomorrow I could be.
No mail is picked up for the next 35+ hours in Oshkosh.
I highly suspect I shall have your list done before 8 o'clock Monday morning.
Who is your first letter to ?
Okay. I can w8 until Monday then. That should be fine.
Are you available tomorrow night at 2000 G / 1900 P ?
I plan to write to my 7 Uncles first, and probably mail them all out at the same time, probably within the next few days (assuming I obtain all of their addresses first, but I may just send to a few of them, if I only have some subset to work with).
I should probably be available again tomorrow night at 2000 G / 1900 P.
Great.   Sounds like a plan.
I wanted to ask you about that.
Bruce, Tony, and Dan are your uncles.
I understand that.
But the other 4 are not.   Correct ?
You just address them as such -- as a matter of respect -- yes ?
Well yeah, technically Kippy, Pat, Billy, and Joey are not exactly my biological or by-marriage "Uncles" but they have each proven to be better Uncles to me than Tony or Bruce have been. Yes, I address them as such partially as a matter of respect, and partially due to them being better role-models and mentors than my official Uncles have been. I trust and respect the Lennons more and better than the Mathews men.
Yep.   I understand.   Thank you.
Do you have any of your letters partially drafted yet ?
Yes, I have some letters partially drafted already, but probably won't have any of my drafts ready to drop in the mail until Monday... so w8ing until then to gain their street addresses should work out just fine.
Do you wish to share any portions with me ?
Well I can summarize a common part of them being some explan8ions of my situ8ion and requests for assistance obtaining any working laptop and printer. If any of them have old (but still functional) laptops or printers laying around that they might be able to send me, I am intending to ask them to please do so. I could use both gr8ly.
Good.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
üòä
What else did you wish to get into tonight ?
2 things. First, I might start looking for full-time Perl development programming work again starting Monday also. Do you think I might be ready to take such a big step, or can you identify any reasons why attempting to do so might seem prem8ure to you?
Excellent question Pip.
Actually 2 questions.
How would you go about answering the first one ?
I'm inclined to answer the first myself as: "Probably." -- but I'd like your opinion on my potential readiness too, if you have one.
Well -- I've got 'em.
But -- I don't know if you want 'em.
Let me ask you a question first.
Puedo ?
I do want your opinion(s). Reasons would be good too, please? Yes, go ahead.
You have been fired from a programming job once -- yes ?
Many times.
Ok.
Good.
You remember the number ?
The number of times ?
No, I don't remember the number. I'm pretty sure I've been fired from at least several more than I've quit from though.
Ok.   Good.
Just pick one (in your mind) that you remember.
The reason your were given for your termination ?
/your/  /you/
"Sleeping on the job."
Good.
Thank you.
Pick another one please.
Reason for that one ?
I often would work all night, but they would ignore that when providing it as a reason for termin8ion.
"We're afraid of getting tax-audited because you've claimed exempt."
Good.
A 3rd one ?
"Arguing with the CFO."
Xcellent.
Now.
Monday -- the 16th of November -- you are going to get hired as a Perl programmer there in Oshkosh.
What do you expect to be fired for ?
I expect to start looking for work on Monday, November 16th of 2020. I expect to find a suitable job and accept a reasonable salary offer sometime in December or January, after having searched and applied for about a dozen available positions. I expect not to get fired from the job I land, expecting instead to quit after I can sustain my ongoing development of Octology and content production for my various YouTube channels through Patreon don8ions which become enough to afford my expenses without needing to retain classic employment.
Good.   Thank you.
You said:
I'd like your opinion on my potential readiness.
I have only one opinion.
If you are resolved (within yourself) to not do anything which might result in your getting terminated -- I believe your are ready.
What do you think ?
I hope I'm ready. I might be.
Well then -- now -- I have a second opinion.
You are not ready.
Why not?
The words "hope" and "might" are not a "yes".
So?
Those fuzzy words say that you have (yourself) said that you are not ready.
No. I don't know that I'm ready. I simply hope I am and might be. I'm honest. Not falsely confident that I'm ready for certain, when the matter is unknown and unknowable with completeness ahead of time.
Then -- if you cannot say that you are ready -- I cannot suggest that you are ready either.
I believe in what you say about yourself Philip.
I wouldn't have even asked you if I were already certain.
There would have been no point.
Good.
I am probably ready. I might be. I hope I am. I cannot say I am certainly ready.
So.   Go apply for the job.
Thanks. I probably will.
The "readiness" will get answered for itself.
Yeah.
Good for you.
Do it !!
Is anything on your PCA that you're ready to bring up now?
Yep.
You mentioned that you might like to write to Cousin Gina.
But you did not ask me for her address.
Yes.
Do you have hers ?
Correct. I probably have her correct address on the Christmas card she and her husband (Jose) sent me last year.
Ok.   I'll check it for you anyway.
Do you wish Cousin Danny's too ?
Thanks. The one I have for Gina and Jose is:  1339 Oswego St. Colorado Springs, Co 80904
No, thanks. I don't know Cousin Danny at all.
Ok.
We'll skip Cousin Danny.
The one you have for Gina is the one I have in my files for Aunt Nina.
I'll check on both of those for you too.
Are we done on this addresses assignment now ?
I think so, for now.
Ok then.
My PCA is back to zero.
We're on for tom at 1900 P ?
Yes. I'll look forward to chatting more tomorrow night hopefully.
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
Good.
Thank you for tonight.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thank you for tonight and today too.
You're welcome.
Thank you too.
Have a good evening -- you and Darjee.
We will. Hope you have a good evening too.
Thank you Pip.
Good night.

KBFLIGHT  (Sun Nov 15 18:16:17:29 -0600 2020)
Hi Dad. I know you're not online yet, but I've finished a pretty strong draft of the letter I wish to send to the 8 men I mentioned. This is my only PCA item for tonight, so I wanted to just paste it in here early, so that you can rEad it whenever you come online and hopefully can comment on, or critique it, in a little while. Here goes...
Dear Uncles :                                                  (Bruce, Tony, Dan,  Pat, Kippy, Billy, && Joey),                                                 
 and Brother:                                                  (                   Tim                       ),
 
How are you doing? Is there any chance you might be able to visit me in Oshkosh Wisconsin any time soon please?
 
Things remain pretty rough with me. I've been stuck in rather dire financial circumstances for the past decade.
 
The main reason I'm writing is in hopes of re-connecting with men I respect, and regard as worth looking up to.
 
I have no family left in this st8 and few friends. Most of my old ones have back-stabbed me and stolen from me.
 
This is a frigid and treacherous place, year-round. I'm usually very isol8d and neglected through my struggles.
 
Please reply whenever you can, and be again 4 me the role-models and honorable mentors you've been in the past.
 
Feel free to e-mail me at PipStuart@GMail.Com if replying via land-based snail-mail is less convenient for you.
 
I gr8ly appreC8 your time and attention. Just reuniting with any of you would probably do wonders 4 my outlook.
 
Thank you each immensely. I love and miss you much. Take and give care to yourselves and each other && be well.
 
Peace and Love,                          -Pip  (Philly-Phil, Delbert, Phil-pants, Flipper, Pepper, Peppy, etc.)
P.S. Both my Moms are wicked and terrible women!  When my Mom was my Disability Payee, she'd often give me only $30 each week to survive on.
  They were supposed to keep my money-collection safe (worth probably upward of $10,000). Instead, she denied my requests to return it to me
  and allowed it to be stolen when she moved to Columbia Missouri 5 years ago. She denies my needs because of my assumed "toxic masculinity"
  and addiction (in spite of the fact that I have remained almost entirely sober for years now, which she refuses to acknowledge and admit).
 
P.S. Additionally while my dream is to become able to afford another Fujitsu LifeBook someday (since my old 2008 LifeBook has died), I could
  gr8ly use any old laptop or printer you may have and no longer need which still works, since I have neither one (&& serious need of both).
  I would be quite glad to try to save up any money I could to cover expenses for shipping either to me, or to compens8 you for their costs.
  Thanks again, very much. I have an overwhelming number of growing needs, but I don't want to be seen as much of a burden to you either. ‚ù§
P.S. If you're interested in what I've been up to, please check out my Octology project on GitHub.Com and my following Google Photos albums:
  https://Photos.App.Goo.gl/COeDDDS7UBwgjW9k2                     --                    --                     --                 "PipzFvr8"

P.S. Please save the included MicroSD 16GB memory-card in a safe dry place, and feel free to look into or copy any files you can find on it.
  I very much want to distribute off-site backups of my valuable code and d8a, just in case catastrophe strikes my apartment (or computers).
  If you ever might wish to similarly send me copies of your own valuable files in a similar fashion, I would be glad to keep them all safe.
  I consider none of my included files to need to be kept priv8 or secret from any of you. I trust you all implicitly and explicitly. Thanx!
That's it! What I've written so far. I think it's probably very close to ready to be hand-written out on my graph-paper and mailed to the 8 of them (once I receive the MicroSD cards and obtain their street addresses, hopefully within the next week or 2).
Are you reading it all now?
I ordered a 10-pack of MicroSD cards from NewEgg yesterday, which should hopefully arrive soon. I've set aside very close to 16GB of my most precious files to copy onto each of them. I probably want to send 8 to them, 1 to Danny, and 1 to you... so that I can know there are identical copies of all of it distributed across the country (in probably at least 3 st8s).
You seem to have been online for over half-an-hour now, but have written nothing. It should have been plenty of time to read my whole letter at least twice. Are you busy doing something else, and want to just chat again another night, or what?
0'11-15-20 - 2037 Gtime / 1937 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
Hello.
Yes -- I came onto Gchat at 2000 G / 1900 P to look for you.
I did you see you -- but I found what had sent to me at what appeared to be 1921 G / 1821 P.
I readd that and waited to see if you were going to arrive.
I was here the whole time.
I don't know how you know when I am online -- but I don't know how to know that about you.
It is not important.
So message.
You are there now.
It *is* important.
I had gone to the kitchen for a time -- and when I got back -- found your other message sent at 2016 G / 1916 P.
So -- we're up to date now.
I see you say you were here the whole time.
So -- my bad.
Sorry.
Please forgive me.
I'll try to.
lol
Thanks.
üòä
Well -- if it doesn't work -- it's perfect.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You think you do. Maybe someday you'll learn how to.
No human is perfect. Part of the human condition is imperfection.
I've readd both of your pre-messages for this evening.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Any thoughts?
A few.
Of your 8 intended addressees -- how many of the 8 have talked to (or written to) you within the past year ?
1. Tim replied to an e-mail saying he doesn't h8 me. That's about it.
Hooray.
We knew that about him -- didn't we ?
No. He acts like he does, despite what he wrote.
Do I act like I hate you Pip ?
Yes.
You claim you don't (like Tim did), but you both know almost nothing about me and show little care or concern for what love means to me, or how to show it in any way that would be meaningful to me.
I suppose now might be a good time for you to share with me -- how you wish to be loved.
Would you like to do that now ?
Okay. Stop sending me Kauai calendars. I h8 that place. I h8 my Moms. Dottie has had a large Kauai sticker on her car for many years. Both she and you have visited that place. I never have been there, and probably will never go. I h8 her. I h8 Kauai. Your common love for the supposedly "beautiful" vac8ion place makes me h8 you too... even though I try to fight it.
A much better way to show me you love me would be to buy me calendars of the Philadelphia Flyers, Yamaha motorcycles, or cute black cats. You and Mom love Kauai. I h8 it.
That sounds pretty easy.
So -- if I stop sending you Kauai calendars -- you will know that I love you ?
It's one big and easy way to do a much better job of showing me love. Take me and my likes into account. Yes, it could be a rel8ively easy start.
No.
It's a start.
Start learning about me. Stop saying I'm perfect. I am not.
Must I stop loving your Mother ?
I don't know. Maybe.
Sorry.
No can do.
Never have.
And never will.
She's evil. She's probably a demon who you have been tricked into thinking is your "Father".
She probably made you mute.
She lied about you in court and to your kids.
You are probably deceived into thinking the voice in your head of your "Father" is this "Eternal Wise One", but it's probably just her. She h8s men. She h8s both of us. She destroys civiliz8ion. She has tried to kill me and has made me suffer many times throughout my entire life. She's the "Evil Wicked Oaf". You would probably do well to stop loving her.
She was / is / and probably always will remain my most favorite person and best friend on earth.
To stop loving Dot would be equivalent to having stopped being me.
Had I not loved her -- you would not be breathing.
Are you angry about breathing ?
Are you fucking retarded?!
I certainly am.
Damn str8!
So -- do I understand this now ?
You hate Mom.
You hate me.
And you hate Tim.
I h8 Mom. I try not to h8 you. I don't know if I h8 Tim.
I don't have a problem with any of that.
I love you Pip.
As I said, you think you do. You claim to.
You scarcely take me into account though. Your words are mostly hollow.
You seem  to forget -- you told me how to love you -- and I did it.
Yet you still do not believe that I love you.
Wrong.
You said not to send you anymore Kauai calendars.
rE-rEad everything we've just typed each other.
And I haven't -- in the past 45 minutes !!
I said that would only be a start.
Can't you fucking rEad?
Does that not show my love for you ?
No! It doesn't.
You're so dense.
Yes I am.
Help me please.
I try to.
#1 - stop the calendars.
What is #2 please ?
#0 - Learn about who Pip really is. If you stubbornly continue to know almost nothing about me, you cannot love me meaningfully.
#1 - Stop Kauai calendars and start sending calendars which take into account what Pip likes.
Ok.   Who is Pip really ?
You don't even care.
I tell you how many times that I'm not perfect.
You insist that I am.
Oh.   Ok.   I stand corrected.
Do not help me to know who you really are -- because I do not care to know.
Is that better ?
Is what better than what?
What are you asking?
Would you feel more loved by me -- if I lied to you -- than telling you my truths ?
No.
Good.
I see you as perfect.
You're blind then.
This is my truth.
It's not true.
I am not perfect.
You don't see me.
The fact that you do not see you as perfect if (totally) ok with me.
But -- it does not change what I see in you.
The fact that you see me as perfect is totally not okay with me.
I know that.
It means you cannot see me.
I'm ok with that.
I'm not. It's a sign that you're blind, deaf, dumb, and mute.
You are correct -- I do not see within you -- what you see within you.
We disagree on that.
You idealize me. You don't care who the real me is.
And -- I'm ok with that disagreement.
You being "ok" with our disagreement about perfection is a sign that you indeed h8 me more than know and love me. A vivid sign!
Tell me this please -- who (besides you) sees the real you Pip ?
Danny, Beppu-san, Duncan, Torrey, Mike, Tone, Amichai, Nissim... for starters.
Xcellent !!
Probably my 7 Uncles have seen the real me in the past and may become capable of doing so again hopefully soon.
Do you chat with Danny, Beppu-san, Duncan, Torrey, Mike, Tone, Amichai, and Nissim on a regular basis ?
Sometimes we stay in touch more closely than other times... but generally: "Yes, we chat on a somewhat regular (even though rather sporadic) basis."
Good.   Sounds like a very loving thing to do.
It can be.
I hope you eventually become capable of rE-rEading everything we've typed to each other tonight, a few times over, and ponder what it all means for both of us. I expect little of it can get through your dense mind, but I hold hope that in time, some of it may be absorbed and understood and then acted upon more lovingly.
I hope so too.
üòä
Please send me as many addresses as you can, as soon as you're able and willing to.
I always re-read our chats -- and frequently multiple times.
Good. I often do rE-rEad our chats too.
I spent about another 5 hours today on the addresses assignment you gave me.
It is not going as smoothly as I had hoped -- but I expect to --
have it completed soon.
Please just provide me with as many addresses as you can, as soon as you can. I probably won't need them before next Friday night though (Nov. 20th of 2020), since I still need to hand-write 8 copies of my draft letter above and will be w8ing for the memory-cards to be delivered before I can copy my files onto each of them and prepare it all to travel through the USPS.
Thanks for working on it. You may be helping me significantly by doing so.
I'm (now) shooting for a completion time of Mon Nov 16 2020 at 2000 G / 1900 P.
I hope it helps you.
I love you Pip.
You're welcome.
It probably will help me. I try to love you, Dad... even when I feel mostly loveless. Did you have comments about my draft letter?
Yes.
A few I have shared.
But -- I also wanted to say that:  it seems "busy".
Had you intended it to be so ?
I don't think you've shared a single comment about my draft letter yet.
You asked one tangential question about whether any of the 8 have communic8d with me within the past year.
I might also ask (along the same lines) -- what was your main (central) reason for the letter ?
What about it seems "busy"?
What do you mean?
My central reason is explained repeatedly in there. I want to re-connect with men I respect.
Well -- skip the "busy" comment then.
And your reason (or reasons) for wanting to re-connect ?
Do you address that in the letter ?
What about the letter seems so unclear or ambiguous to you?
Yes. I addressed that.
Ok.
Thank you.
You have answered my questions.
You're welcome.
I'm needing to take a smoke-break and a walk around the block. I should be back inside maybe a little after 9PM Ptime here, and will check to see if you've made any more comments during the time I was away. Feel free to type whatever you wish to discuss once I've returned... or we can just plan to try to continue chatting more tomorrow (Monday) evening if you'd prefer that. Either way should be fine with me.
Did you have anything else you wanted to discuss this evening ?
No.
Let's re-convene tomorrow night. Thanks for chatting tonight.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Look for you tomorrow night.
KBFLL8rD  (Sun Nov 15 21:08:53:13 -0600 2020)
Have a good evening.
I love you Pip.
You too. Bye.
Bye.

Hi Dad.
1'11-16-20 - 2015 Gtime / 1915 Ptime
Hello Philip.
How are you this evening ?
Kinda tired, but ready to chat for a while. Just woke up from about an hour of sleep after Medic8ion Observ8ion.
Good for you.
Usually I can open my "chat window" before you call.
But tonight -- no.
Hmm. Maybe it can be fickle sometimes.
I get a half of a message that Hangouts is going to be "turned off soon" -- and there is no way to read the whole message -- and no way to open this chat window.
So -- I'm glad you called.   That made it open without any doing from me.
Nice. Glad it can work out.
I went online to see what I could find out about what Google is doing with the Hangouts -- and had just begun to find some information on it when you called.
So -- I shall get back into that research later.
Okay. Please feel free to message me with what you find. I'm interested in what Google is doing with HangOuts too.
I just might do that.
But -- as long as you can reach me -- that's what is important to me.
Most of the "addresses project" thing is done.
I spent a pile of work on it today -- and it has gone well.
I'm having problems with formatting -- but I'll work those out soon -- I hope.
When do you expect your SDs to arrive ?
Gr8! Thanks. I should probably need them (just for those 8 men) on Friday maybe (but any of them anytime sooner would still be welcome).
I expect the MicroSD's to arrive hopefully Wednesday or Thursday.
Well ok.
I only see a couple more hours needed before I have this address-thing ready to get to you.
Cool.
So -- you should be in good shape.
üòä
üòä
Sorry for the double-face.
My friend, Jer, said he can probably help me to make color copies of my hand-written letter, so I won't have to hand-write all 8 (or 9 to send you one too) copies.
The first one didn't look like it worked.
That'll be nice.
Yeah. He also invited me to spend ThanksGiving with his family. Very nice of him.
Just don't make it look like a "mass" letter.
Turkey and all ?
He's there in Oshkosh ?
I've revised the draft somewhat. It should be less "busy" now. Do you want to see what the text is now?
Yes, turkey and all. He lives in Appleton. He was my old upstairs neighbor off Honey Lou.
Do you consider it "finished" now ?
That's nice.
Yes, it is probably "finished" now.
Your car is running ?
I've written the main message out by hand on front and back of one sheet of graph-paper. I just have 2 P.S. sections now (culled down from 4 last night).
Ok then.   If you like it as it now is -- yes I'd love to look it over.
Yes, my car is running.
Okay. I will paste it here.
                 I will w8.
The first part is almost identical to what I had last night, just with one line taken out. Here goes...
Dear Uncles :                                                  (Bruce, Tony, Dan,  Pat, Kippy, Billy, && Joey),
 and Brother:                                                  (                   Tim                       ),

How are you doing? Is there any chance you might be able to visit me in Oshkosh Wisconsin any time soon please?

Things remain pretty rough with me. I've been stuck in rather dire financial circumstances for the past decade.

The main reason I'm writing is in hopes of re-connecting with men I respect, and regard as worth looking up to.

I have no family left in this st8 and few friends. Most of my old ones have back-stabbed me and stolen from me.

Please reply whenever you can, and be again 4 me the role-models and honorable mentors you've been in the past.

Feel free to e-mail me at PipStuart@GMail.Com if replying via land-based snail-mail is less convenient for you.

I gr8ly appreC8 your time and attention. Just reuniting with any of you would probably do wonders 4 my outlook.

Thank you each immensely. I love and miss you much. Take and give care to yourselves and each other && be well.

Peace and Love,                          -Pip  (Philly-Phil, Delbert, Phil-pants, Flipper, Pepper, Peppy, etc.)

P.S. Both my Moms are wicked and terrible women! When Mom was my SSDI Disability Payee, she'd often give me only $30 per week to survive on.
  They were supposed to keep my money-collection safe (worth probably upward of $10,000). Instead, she denied my requests to return it to me
  and allowed it to be stolen when she moved to Columbia Missouri 5 years ago. She denies my needs because of my assumed "toxic masculinity"
  and addiction (in spite of the fact that I have remained almost entirely sober for years now, which she refuses to acknowledge and admit).

P.S. If you're interested in what I've been up to, please check out my Octology project on GitHub.Com and my following Google Photos albums:
  PipzFvr8 : HTTPS://Photos.App.Goo.gl/COeDDDS7UBwgjW9k2 ;  Please save the included MicroSD 16GB memory-card in a safe dry place. Feel free
  PipzDarj : HTTPS://Photos.App.Goo.gl/E7wUCrfsuwSLLRif2 ;    2 read, use, or copy any files you find on it which might be useful 2 you too.
  PipzDfns : HTTPS://Photos.App.Goo.gl/6VaCvjSvhSjM7Dzw5 ;  Also, if U have an old working printer around, I'll pay 2 ship it here. Thnx! ‚ù§
That's it for now.
I still have to write out the 2 P.S. sections on a sepR8 sheet of paper before I will be taking them to Jer's to get color copies made.
Then I will aw8 the MicroSD's arrival to get loaded with my top 16GB of files to include in letters to those 8 men and 1 copy to you too.
Sorry for the delay.
I had to reload gmail.
And then -- I had to figure out how to get the chat box open.
It's fine. I know it happens sometimes. I try to remain p8ient.
But I did it.
I'm going to read what you sent now.
BBS.
Any comments on the upd8d message text? Ah, okay.
Just for your reference, BBS normally refers to old dial-up Bulletin-Board-Systems, and is rarely used as you do to indic8 "Be Back Shortly". For this, usually "BBiaB" for "Be Back in a Bit" or "AFK" for "Away From Keyboard" is much more typically (and less ambiguously) used in online chatting.
How about HFC ?
Does that work ?
I don't know what HFC means.
Hanging From Ceiling
Sounds kinky!  üòâ
(flying around)
Ok.   Well.   I'm back.
I was going to guess "Have Fun Coding!"  üòä
            And -- in answer to your question:
Okay. Welcome back.
               Nope.   No comments.
Does it at least seem less "busy" now?
If you're happy with it -- that's all that's really important.
If you'll remember -- I had decided to rescind that "busy" comment.
I have hopes that at least 1 of the 8 recipients will be prompted to reply to me in a return letter of e-mail. That will make the whole effort worthwhile for me.
Well -- I hope that you get 9 replies.
        That's what I hope.
I didn't quite know what you meant by "busy", but suspected that whatever you meant by it, maybe it would seem less applicable now that I took out one of the lines from the main message and cut down the old 4 P.S. sections down to just 2 now.
Yeah, you'll count as a 9th recipient. I intend to send you an extra special page that the other 8 will not receive.
No -- that's not what I was implying.
Oops. I meant "return letter *or* e-mail" ... not "of".
My 9 meant that all 8 reply once -- and at least someone becomes a regular with you.
I caught that.
I knew you meant "or".
But thank you for mentioning it.
Ah. Nice. Yeah, I totally hope someone becomes a regular with me too. Thank you. Glad you understood.
I strongly hope it's either Uncle Bruce Mathews or Kip, Pat, Billy, or Joey Lennon. I have less confidence that Tony, Dan, or Tim will be able to take my side against Mom, so I'm less interested in their opinions and likely responses.
Sides.
Hmm.
Yeah. What do you think about taking such sides? With what you know and have read that I've written about things so far, would you consider yourself to be more on my side, or hers?
Is that like a choice between broccoli or mashed potatoes ?
Yes, something like that.
Sides (in this kind of context) sounds like a war is brewing.
I grew up in the 50s and 60s.
Indeed, one probably is.
     And our mantra was:             Make love -- not war.
Rather challenging mantra to interpret though.
When nations go to war -- I go to Canada.
I love you Pip.
Having sexual intercourse doesn't seem like a direct or simple altern8ive to waging war.
I am here for you.
Thanks Dad. I try to love you too.
I will keep trying to be here for you too.
I am not interested in wars.
I do think something like at least an ideological (if not also somewhat monetary and maybe physical) war is brewing between my Mom and I.
When you wish to talk about things which distress you -- I am here.
But then -- you know that.
üòä
I love your Mother.
Thanks. I appreC8 that you are here for me, at least via chat almost every week (or even more often than just each Friday evening).
I know you do.
I think I made that quite clear.
But -- I also love you Pip.
I had a question that maybe I could ask you now.
And not one more than the other.
You said that you have never stopped loving my Mom and that you never will.
You wish to chat.
Mom does not wish to chat.
I'm fine with that.
So -- by Mom not wishing to chat with me -- I get to give more of my time to you.
I wondered today: If my Mom hypothetically began entering Elementary Schools across the n8ion and slaughtering classrooms full of young rel8ively innocent children, might you become capable of no longer loving her, were she to do that?
Everything is a win.
Nice. I'm glad you have so much time to chat with me.
Mom doesn't wish to chat with me either.
She h8s men, and seems to wish a quick death upon all of us, so that she can attempt to bring about her simple-minded vision for a Feminist Socialist Utopia of some sort.
Did you (really) want an answer to your question ?
Yes, please.
Or -- was it rhetorical ?
Oh.
Ok.
I shall answer it.
The short answer is -- if she did such a thing -- I would love her more.
Hmm. Unexpected answer.
Do you not think if she did that -- she would be crying out for help ?
Of course she would.
Maybe she would be, but that doesn't mean she'd be deserving of more love.
Crying out for help in ways that massacre and commit genocide probably are not deserving of even more love than had cries out for help been made in other more ethical ways.
At least as I see things, for now.
And -- I may not applaud everything that my acquaintances  do.   But that does not ever stop my love for them.
I see.  That makes sense, from your perspective.
This goes for Mom.   This goes for you.   This goes for Katy.   This even goes for my own self.
So then, is there any hypothetical scenario you *can* imagine which might cause you to stop loving my Mom?
I'm quite curious what such a scenario might be, no matter how far-fetched.
I do not applaud everything that I do -- but if I were to stop loving me because of one of those things -- I would certainly be casting my self into some really deep doodoo !!
Hmm. I can understand that, somewhat.
The answer to that last question is:   of course not.
If I could stop loving -- I would have had to have stopped being who I am.
Do you love S8n ("Satan")? What if my Mom is the living embodiment of S8n? Would you still love her then?
Hmm. Maybe in some sense, that would be true.
I do not believe in a satan.
But changing and growing means in some senses that you need to stop being who you are, in order to become different and hopefully better.
Ah. Do you believe in evil beings?
So -- I cannot (therefore) believe that a person is its embodiment.
Okay. Do you believe people can be or become fundamentally evil?
Do I believe in evil beings ?
Yes.
No.   I believe that I (and others) have done evil things.
I see.
But that does not make me (or them) an evil being.
An (occasional) evil doier -- yes.
An evil being -- no.
What stops an "occasional" evil-doer from doing so much more evil than good that they ought to be best understood as fundamentally evil themselves, rather than merely capable of just doing some slight evil sometimes?
An interesting question.
Would you share your answer to it please ?
For example, do you think Adolf Hitler only occasionally did evil?
My answer is: "Little."
I think there are such things as fundamentally evil beings.
Beings that do so much more evil than good, that they are best understood as actually evil themselves.
Evil beings. Rare, but they exist. I believe both my Moms are such beings.
Ok.   I guess it's my turn.
I'll start with the question about Mr. Hitler.
Okay.
Adolf had many excellent qualities within his person.   Admirable.   Many characteristics that few others have bothered to develop within themselves.   And many that The Bible (clearly) tells us to cultivate.   ¬∂   However.   Somewhere along the way -- he also started to chew on some nasty ideas.   These are notions that you would call "evil" -- and I would agree with you.   ¬∂   But these evil notions (somehow) got locked into his mind.   And he went down that road with a vengeance.   ¬∂   Were any one of those evil notions of his any worse than feelings I (also) have found within myself ?   No.   The only difference between us is that I (for some reason) was able to see that evil within me -- and I chose to turn away from it. 
Hmm. Okay. Good answer, I guess.
Your Mother will not always be as she is today.
She is on her path.
I am on mine.
You are on yours.
And I know where we all end up.
So -- it is very easy for me to love all 3 of us.
üòä
Where do we all end up, and how do you know that?
I see 2 questions.
Do I get to pick which one I answer first ?
Sure.
Good.
Thank you.
Where do we all end up ?
     Ooo  ooo  ooo.
             Such an easy one.
                         We all end up           hugging            forever       !!
I won't.
That's up to you Pip.
Even assuming I live forever, I certainly won't spend it hugging you or her or both of you or anyone else and doing nothing but.
But -- I'll hug you -- if you will permit it.
And I have no say over what you wish.
If you and I live forever, and you don't get in my way too much, I may permit you to essentially hug me forever.
Or anyone else -- either.
So how could you know that you will spend forever hugging Mom and me? How could that be easy to know?
I see 2 more questions.
The first is basically the 2nd question from before.
I'm going for the second one first.
How could that be easy to know ?
       It is not.            It is very difficult to come to such a knowledge !!
I think I've already proven that you don't actually *know* what we all 3 end up doing though. You said we all end up hugging each other forever. I said, I won't hug forever, even assuming I *do* live forever. You then acknowledged that and said you have no say over whatever I wish. So obviously you didn't *know* where I would end up, if you assumed I would simply hug you and her forever, which I won't do.
Excellent comments Pip.
If I live even close to forever, I have many far more important things to do than merely hug.
                  ( applause goes here )
You and she may hug essentially forever though. Maybe you can do it in Kauai together quite happily. Maybe you deserve each other, in some lengthy dur8ion approaching forever.
I don't know.
Thanks.
( bow goes here )
You're welcome Pip.
üòâ
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
          Of course -- you know -- that when you bow -- we just applaud even more fervently.
üòä
What about a curtsie?  üòâ
I'm still working on perfecting mine.
I'll show it to you when I think I've got it nailed.
Sounds gr8! I look forward to seeing it, whenever you think you're ready.  üòä
Good.
Although it is not important -- and I (fully) knew what you meant -- there are only 2 standard (allowable) sppelings for that dance movement -- curtsey & curtsy.
Thanks. I guessed that, after the auto-spelling suggested I had it wrong. I was close though.
Yep.
I suspect "curtsie" is an even cuter, more feminine way of spelling it, and ought to be deserving of inclusion in the set of accepted spellings.
At the risk of being scolded for saying so -- you (Pip) were not only "close enuff" -- you were perfect !!
Thanks. I can be perfect here and there, once in a while. Just not all the time. I have to go pee. BBiaB.
lol
P                             away.
           I'll w8.
Thanks. I'm back.
Good to see your back Pip.
I've been drinking a lot of coffee and limeade today. Now I've started on some iced tea. I love drinks even more than food most of the time.
you're
I love limeade too.
Where do you find it ?
I end up making my own.
Salv8ion Army gets it don8d to their food pantry sometimes, and they then can give it to me. Tasty!
Hmm.
No -- not "you're" -- I said it the way I wanted it to go.
üòä
Ah. Okay then.
Well in that case, I said: "I'm back." meaning that's what you should call me now, not "Pip". Just kidding.  üòâ
Hello Back.
Have we run outta stuff to say ?
This was a very pleasant chat Pip.
Maybe I have for now. Is there anything else you'd like to chat about tonight?
Thank you so mush.
Yes, I agree. Thank you for a very nice chat tonight.
         I always have room for these.
Much rooms.
Cute.  üòä
No -- I'd kinda like to go (try to) finish the assignment you gave me.
Okay.
Puedo ?
Can we do this again tom at 2000 G / 1900 P ?
Well please feel free to do your thing and message me whenever you have as many addresses as you've been able to find... or yeah, let's just plan to chat again tomorrow (Tuesday, Nov. 17th) night at 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime. Sounds good.
Good.
          Sounds like a plan.
Have a good night and day before then.
                       I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
I will if you will.
Thank you Pip.
Thanks.
     I feel hugged.
üòä
Me too.  üòä
                  Is every             body happy ?
KBGLLBGK
I'm happy for now.
Ok then.
Are you?
G'night.
I am too.
Good night, Dad.
Good night, Pip.

No Pip -- I am not looking to chat with you this early.
I am just performing some preparatory tests.

Hi Dad. Please feel free to conduct whatever tests you'd find useful.
Thank you.
I'd highly recommend though that you attempt to vertically align things using fixed-width fonts.
I did.
Gchat doesn't allow for that -- does it ?
Then, even if we have to exchange them temporarily through variable-width fonts, you can compose them fixed-width and just let me know and I will copy / paste them into my fixed-width terminals to re-construct what you intended.
GChat stupidly doesn't seem to have any fixed-width support that I know of yet.
I'm not sure even that will retain all of my formatting.
The spaces get lost.
It might not... but probably will and should be worth a shot.
Maybe so.
It could be best to compose them then in fixed-width formatting and then just attach them as files to e-mails instead of even using GChat for the purpose.
If I send you a txt file that I created with a fixed-width font -- will you receive it fixed-widthedly ?
GMail also at least does have a way to set font faces to fixed-width in-line in e-mails too.
Yes.
Oh.   How so ?
In my GMail Compose sub-window, there's a "San Serif" drop-down among the bottom widgets which has a little down-arrow that can be clicked and then "Fixed Width" can be selected.
If that doesn't work for you, you can just attach .txt files and I should receive them normally as fixed-width, as is my strong preference for all text.
Vertical alignment has almost always mattered to me, very much!  üòä
Me too.
I'm going to go check into those widgets you mentioned.
BBSh
Cool. Take your time.
Be Back Shortly
Thank you.
2'11-17-20 - 1937 Gtime / 1837 Ptime
Ok -- I have my compose open.
KBHLIbex
Where is the widget I need ?
Click "Verdana" on yours.
I get a popup with 11 choices.
Should I select "fixed width" ?
Yes.
Gonna do that now.
It seems to be working.
But it's very hard to read.
Can I bold it ?
Yes... and change size.
Ah yes I can.
Sizing -- where is that ?
Next to Font. Ctrl-Shift-Plus "+" on mine shows as a hot-key to change it too.
Ah yes -- it's the "TT" thingy.
You may have to mouse drag-select the text first, then click the widgets to change Font Face and Size of the selection... but just picking them then typing in the composition area should be reflecting you changes.
Now I'm going to see if I can paste text into this new "compose" window.
BBS
Cool.
I hope you don't mind if I use my old BBS.
Since you now know what I mean by it.
üòä
It's okay. I'm usually pretty good at discerning intent and disambigU8ing.  üòä
Oh crud.
Pasting ignores my blank lines.
Do you have an easy fix for that ?
No. You may need to manually insert them again, if they matter to you. I h8 blank lines though, so you shouldn't need to worry about any with me.
I like them as they help general readability.
But -- I think I know how to make 'em happen.
They inhibit readability for me. I almost never have blank lines in any code or d8a files I work with.
I realize that.   I too adhere to that in my coding.
I couldn't even guess where you might find a single blank line throughout all of Octology.
But this is a "letter".   And I want it to look "paragraphy".
Well -- I can fix it.
Just attach it as a .txt file then. I'll see it almost identically to however you've composed it.
In-line in e-mail is transl8ing through HTML layers, which are extraneous if we're both attempting to work with fixed-width text files.
Ah.   Thank you.
Right now I've got 2 Gmail windows open.
One for the email I'm going to sent you (with the addresses project) -- and another for chatting.
And I guess you can do that too -- so we can talk about the thing I send you -- yes ?
You may also be able to find the chat diagonal pop-out arrow.
Yes.
Ok.   Give me some time to get the email ready (composed).
I'll be back in (hopefully) a short while.
üòä
No problem. I will be here whenever you're ready.
Thank you Pip.
2'11-17-20 - 2001 Gtime / 1901 Ptime
I'm starting to get pretty tired. Might have to go to bed soon. If I do, hopefully I can find your e-mail in the morning and maybe we can just plan to chat more again tomorrow (Wed.) night at our usual time.
2034 G / 1934 P
I've got the first part ready.
Is now ok -- or too tired ?
Now is fine. I'm getting tired though.
I got up early and have had a really long day.
Ok.   I'll send it.   If you need to snooze -- just say so.
üòä
Okay.
Sent 2038 G / 1938 P
Did it work ?
Looks like it. I've received the e-mail and am copying the message body now.
Good.
Thank you.
Is it clean -- and nicely formatted ?
Yep.
Good.
You read.
I'll read with you.
You comment or ask questions as you go -- as you wish.
Thanks. Reading now. No comments or questions yet.
What does "SSA" and "SSS" stand for?
SSA  =  SkinSuit Advent
SSS  =  SkinSuit Surrendered
Why don't you use something normal, like: "BirthDay"?
I do not care for the traditional terms.
Your Dad marches to a different drummer.
I know. It's often frustr8ing dealing with how non-traditional so many of your initialisms (in particular) are... but I may just have to ask what they stand for a few times before I get used to your obtuseness.
lol
It's ok.
Ask as many times as you wish.
So why is there not a single address in this whole e-mail? I asked for help with addresses, not just lists of names and explan8ions for discrepancies between which nick-names are preferred by whom and who babysat me for some year or another. What is your major malfunction?!
Hey.   You don't have to get nasty.
They are in Part D.
You're being nasty, providing nothing that I asked for.
Are you ready for part D -- or would you prefer to sleep before that ?
Part D is all I wanted. I've been ready for it since I first asked for it.
Ok.
 
On your "addresses assignment" -- you gave me good
information to work with.   ¬∂   Thank you so much.
 
You said that "The Top 8" were probably
either California or Missouri.
 
And you were right.  Good job Pip.
 
01 - Bruce   CA
02 - Tony    CA
03 - Tim     CA
04 - Kip     CA
05 - Pat     CA
06 - Dan     MO
07 - Billy   MO
08 - Joey    CA
 
That helped quite a bit in finding them.
 
Of course - Tim & Dan I already had.
But you were a big help on the other 6.
 
Thank you again.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
You're welcome.
I'll prepare the Part D now.
Gimme a few seconds please.
Sent 2104 G / 2004 P
Got it. Thanks.
You're very welcome Pip.
Nice job. It looks very good.
Thank you.
I gr8ly appreC8 your help with this.
You're welcome.
Here are the 6 other photos I came up with.
All right, well I think I'm about ready for bed. Can we please re-convene on Friday, November 20th at 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime?
This goes with Section 13.
This goes with Section 14.
Okay, please feel free to paste the 6 other photos you came up with. I will catch up with what you've presented and check all of them out in the morning.
This goes with Section 15.
The following 3 go with Section 07.
Those are the 3 promo photos for the Thanksgiving 2018 Concert -- by The Lennon Brothers & Gail.

you.

Hi Dad.
Did you want to chat tonight?
P.S. Thank you again, so very much for the incredibly awesome job you did obtaining the addresses of the 8+ I asked for! I'm sorry I got nasty. I was just imp8ient, but you did a totally phenomenal job of it. I'm very gr8ful.
3'11-18-20 - 1918 Gtime / 1818 Ptime
Did you ?
... want to chat tonight ?
I only have one thing I know I'd like to potentially talk about tonight. How about you?
Yes. Please?
Ok.   But first of all --
Thank you for your apology.
And -- for your gratefulnessing too.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're welcome. I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
I was happy to do it for you.
I hope all the "extras" were of some interest to you.
I haven't read all of them yet, but of all the ones I have so far, they're totally gr8 to have. So much excellent background of everyone's birthdays and family rel8ionships and activities. It's a treasure-trove of family that I love. Thank you so!
Yes, most of it is of more than just "some" interest to me.
I may not need to know it all right now, but I'm really glad to be able to learn so much more about all of them. Just totally excellent stuff!
Good.
            I'm glad it serves you.
It sure does.
Your researching skills are remarkably formidable.
I have tons of other stuff on the Lennons -- mostly from that research I did back in 2013 -- but the sharing of it can w8 until another time (I think).
Thank you for your "researching" applause Pip.
Cool. I look forward to learning about all of that hopefully soon too, whenever you're ready to delve into it.
You deserve it.
          Your Dad is bowing now.
üòä
I'm hooting and hollering. Standing ov8ion.  üòä
lol
         I love it.
Thank you.   Thank you.   Thank you.  
Bravo!
You asked if I had a PCA.
I did not.
Okay. I just have 1 item.
But I do have one now -- since you called.
Okay.
However -- mine will w8.
Fine.
Let's do yours please.
I just have 1 item.
I think I mentioned that I very much want to start developing regular video content for YouTube soon, right?
Yes -- you did.
Well the first channel I most want to focus on will be called: "PedanticPip" and I aim to register the channel name and record and make my first upload a week from today, on the day before ThanksGiving, November 25th.
Ok.   Go on please.
In prepR8ion for that day and plan, I could really use one special prop in particular, so I'd like to ask if there's any way you could please somehow afford to purchase it for me?
It's on sale right now for about another 5 hours. It's a beautiful Philadelphia Phillies baseball cap. It would correspond with my PedanticPip channel initials most nicely and I'd be totally proud to wear it for many of them.
Here's the link:

Wow!   I very short link.
I'm going there now.
Maybe it could be an early BirthDay / ChristMas present or something?
BBS
Okay.
Hmm.
What makes you think I'm getting you a present ?
üòä
I just thought you might be able to. If you could, I'd very much like this, or another very much like it. Having it delivered before next Wednesday, November 25th, if possible would be awesome.
There are some Philadelphia Phillies baseball caps with 1976 stylings too, which would also be an excellent choice I think.
Which is the '76 one ?
You'd have to search for it. I don't have a link opened to any of the '76 ones right now. Google or DuckDuckGo should be able to find them though, if you'd prefer maybe one of those instead of the one I've just linked. Adjustable probably is best, since I'm not sure about my precise head-size for the nicer more expensive fitted ones.
Wouldn't you rather have a cap that said "Pip" ?
s/link/browser tab/;
Ooh. Hmm. I didn't think of that.
You mean have a custom baseball cap made that's embroidered with Pip on it?
That's a nice idea too. Yeah!
Absolutely !!
Could it be mainly a dark purple fabric with some rel8ively bright pink colored embroidery of "Pip"? I don't know what's possible or affordable, but something like that would be even better probably. Getting it before next Wednesday though might be tougher to arrange for custom work, I'd guess. Hmm.
I would have 2 suggestions.
#1 - possibly you should look into that.
I'd also very much like there to be a visible "P" on the back-side too, so that I can turn the bill around backwards so that it doesn't shade over my face for videos but there can still be a vivid "P" visible (even if pretty small) on the back as well.
#2 - get it right -- don't get it fast.
Ask them about that too.
I'm pretty sure the Philadelphia Phillies one I've linked would be right enough, and probably could arrive fast enough.
There should be time to get custom ones made l8r.
What is the main purpose of the presentations that you wish to make ?
I really want to have a good "P" cap (with another little "P" on the back) arrive in time for me to wear it next Wednesday.
The main purpose of PedanticPip's present8ions is to break apart intellectual YouTube content with a meticulous approach to language analysis and criticism of ambiguities, contradictions, the likelihood of prevalent misunderstandings, providing counter-examples for assertions, serious criticisms, deb8ing, etc..
Having synergy with my name "PP" and a PhiladelphiaPhillies "PP" baseball cap seems like a nearly ideal choice to get started with. I'll probably also wear my Pomegran8 Perl shirt too.  üòä
Ok.   Good.   Thank you.
You're welcome. You may not be all that surprised, but I have to go "PP" right now. BBiaB.  üòâ
Back from a very successful urin8ion. Haha.
Good to have you back.
Is there a difference between P-ing and PP-ing ?
Usually not. I think they're usually said slightly differently though as: "I have to pee!" or "I have to *go* pee-pee!" Otherwise probably pretty interchangeable though.
lol
Ok.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'd also eventually like to obtain a couple Pittsburgh Pir8s and Philadelphia Flyers caps to rot8 into my PP costume mix... but just Phillies first and primary seems best to start with.
Noted.
Thank you.
The more I can get in Purple, Pink, or Pomegran8 colors should be nice to prefer as well, whenever any of those are available. A custom "Pip" front and small "P" back would be gr8 to have at some point too, I think. I'll have to look into that when such might become affordable. I have only about $7 to my name (in all my bank accounts combined) right now, so I'm very poor at the moment.
You and Angie just ‚ù§
 purple !!
I don't really love purple much. I love blue far more than any other color, but I love all colors a gr8 deal.
The two of you used to be linked together at the hip.
Purple and burgundy are her favorite colors.
We're certainly not linked anymore. She has neglected me and ignored my needs (and Darjee's), similar to how Moms have.
I know.
Ange is no longer my friend. I cannot trust her anymore.
But -- this will change.
She will apologize.
It might. I hope it does.
She might.
Inside -- she is a good person.
I might be able to accept an apology at some point, but am presently disinclined to .
She might be.
I have serious doubts.
But good people (sometimes) do bad things.
True.
I am not proud of everything I have ever done either.
My very early one was when I was in 1st Grade.
But -- I is fore-given.
The cap I linked you on Fanatics.Com looks like it will only be on sale for a bit over 4 more hours, so if there's any chance you could please buy it for me tonight and have it delivered before next Wed. Nov. 25th, I'd be very appreC8ive.
And the tongue-lashing I got from Miss Fister -- I have never forgotten.
I've done some bad things too, and probably will do many more bad things again ahead. Hopefully none will be understood as extremely bad though. I hope my badness remains rel8ively mild.
My hope is that your "badness" dissolves.
               And -- I know that my hope will happen.
That sounds like a mostly good thing to hope for.
But not within the next 2 or 3 days probably.
Dr. Peterson has some interesting lectures on how important it can be to cultiv8 some parts of your own badness or internal monster, so that you can mostly keep it under control and become better as a result of harnessing your capacity for evil to do even more good.
I find it to be a pretty intriguing concept.
Probably insightful.
There are a number of things that Doctor P. promotes.   ¬∂   I subscribe to many of them.   ¬∂   And then --
There others -- which I don't.
Same for me. I agree with him on many or even most things he puts forward, but I still have some issues that I disagree with him rather strongly about.
Yep.  
Ditto.
My PP channel will probably primarily be dealing with Dr. Peterson for the first few months at least. He has a lot of material I'm interested in exploring as PedanticPip.
Well that Phillies cap was the only thing I really wanted to ask you about tonight.
Ok.
Please order it for me and have it delivered promptly, if you can.
Why have you chosen next Wednesday as your premier performance ?
Because of my d8 clock.
In my Base-64 encoding of all d8 fields: Year, Month, Day,  zone, hour, minute, second, phass ... the numbers go zero 0 ... 9 nine then upper-case A to Z then lower-case a to z then dot '.' and underscore '_'.
So "P" is 25. So I want all PP content to get recorded and get uploaded on the 25th of every Month. The first one should be next Wednesday. The 2nd should be on ChristMas... and so on.
Is your first one done yet ?
Ready to upload ?
No. I will be rehearsing for the next week, then recording and uploading both on the 25th. I'm not preparing the recording ahead of time, just rehearsing early.
s/recording and uploading both/both recording and uploading/;
I hope it goes well -- and that you are happy with it.
Thanks. I'll send you a link to it once it's up, and hopefully you can let me know if you have any thoughts about it.
I see 2 thoughts there.
On the first one -- thank you -- I'd like that.
You're welcome... and you will be welcome to watch it once it goes public, probably during the morning hours of next Wednesday.
I'll look forward to receiving your link -- thank you.
I'm almost out of tobacco right now, so I think I need to run to the store and pick up another pack of cigars with $3 of my last $7. Can we please chat again Friday night at our usual time?
I believe that'll work fine for me.
Gr8! I'll look forward to hopefully connecting with you online then.
Would you like to know the first item on my PCA for Friday evening ?
Thanks for our chat tonight.
Sure. What is it?
I would like to know what you did this week in preparation for getting a new programming job.
Thank you also for our chat tonight.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're welcome.
I can tell you now that I've only sent one e-mail this week to a recruiter at Perl.Careers to ask if Pete S. there could please help me find a job. I'm focusing on starting PedanticPip's channel on YouTube first, before taking more serious steps to find Perl work probably in December or January.
Why so far off (Dec/Jan) ?
I've also had a change of plans somewhat. I'm going to ask my 7 Uncles and Brother if the 8 of them can all work together to buy Captain's Cove, the 8-building complex where I live. I'd like them to let Beppu-san and I be the LandLords and MaintenanceMen of this place.
It seems to me that your finances could use the help of a job well before then -- yes ?
Hmm.
That's an interesting idea.
I'm still receiving SSDI monthly, so I shouldn't remain totally broke for too long.
But I didn't see that included in your letter.
It isn't included in the letter yet.
You can see it in the 3rd linked Photos album though... the PipzDfns one, at the end now.
Does your SSDI come at a standard time of month ?
I wrote Doug Carder (the current Captain's Cove LandLord) a letter asking about connecting the owner(s) with my Uncles to see if a purchase price can be agreed upon.
Yes, my Payee (Payment Partner) receives my SSDI checks at a standard time each Month.
They normally send me very close to $100 each week for me to spend on my own personal expenses (which only comes out of my funds after they've paid all my important bills).
I see.
Is $100 a week sufficient ?
Sometimes. It's pretty hard to have so little to work with for all my personal expenses (and Darjee's), but I may be able to survive for quite a while still on so little, if my other prospects keep getting brighter. We'll see. I can earn up to $900 per Month extra before I start jeopardizing SSDI benefits continuing. I should have about 9 Months of exceeding $900 extra though, before I lose benefits entirely and need to sustain myself with only what I can make on my own. It's "means-tested" and it's actually a grave injustice. It's a poverty trap, essentially.
Well let's please wrap this chat up for tonight. I need to run to the store. Thanks again for the chat tonight. Please order me the cap if you can. I ‚ù§
you and hope to chat again Friday. Have a good night and Thursday and Friday ahead.  üòä
I'd love to see you back in a Perl job by your 44th BD.
I'm sorry that I will not be able to help you out with the cap.
Does John B. want to move to Oshkosh ?
That could be nice, but becoming LandLord of Captain'sCove would probably be better. I could do it for exactly $900 pay each Month for the first 6-Months to a Year. We'll see.
Thank you again for tonight.
I'll look for you Friday Pip.
Thanks anyway about the cap. Thanks at least for considering it. It would help me a lot, but I understand if you can't do it. Ah well.
I ‚ù§
 you.
John may consider moving to Oshkosh. He's hard to get a hold of l8ly, but hopefully he'll become ready to get back in touch with me and consider the possibility rel8ively soon.
I hope so.   He strikes me as a good friend.
He is.
Why is he hard to get a hold of ?
He doesn't answer e-mails, calls, voice-mails, or text-messages from me l8ly. Hopefully he'll reconnect with me again over one-or-more of those mechanisms soon.
Why don't you try a brief "SM" letter to him ?
I might. He's probably living back with his parents right now in Ventura, California. I don't have their street address yet. Maybe you could please help me find that too?
His name is     John Beppu    ?
John Satoshi Beppu
Good.
Thank you.
As of Thu Jul 25 2019 -- the address I had for him was:
Thank you too. Have a good night.  ‚ù§

Hi Dad.
If you're w8ing for me to chat first.
I sent an e-mail a little while ago which you, Tim, Dan, and Pat might receive. Tony's old e-mail address bounced back as no longer available. Can you please try to find the correct e-mail addresses for the others in my Dear lines, and forward the URL and messages to the recipients I've design8d but haven't had myself via e-mail yet, and short-circuited my plan to snail-mail their street addresses. May still, but might no longer need to. Not sure.
5'11-20-20 - 2007 Gtime / 1907 Ptime
Good Evening Pip.
Good Evening Dad.
How are you today?
üòä
Nice. Me as well.  üòä
We'll talk about that.
About what?
Which that?
But first -- I want to read what you said before I got here.
Be right back.
Ok.   I readd it.
Okay.
Haven't had a chance to read your email from a few hours ago yet.
You might want to take time to.
My past 7+ hours have been "dictated to me".
You might want to use "rEad" versus "readd".
Dict8d from whom?
Tera shut down at 1301 Gtime today -- in the midst of my doing some housecleaning in her.
So -- I spent the next several hours looking into that.
It is a fan problem.
UninitE8d shut-down can be troubling, if that's what yours was.
The fan died -- so Tera said "nope" -- I refuse to over heat -- so you're done for today Gerry.
So -- that's that for now.
Sounds like you could use newer equipment similarly to me. Maybe we'll be able to someday. I hope before Spring.
I then got Sammi (my laptop) out of the closet -- and (with more that a little trouble) got her up and running.  
Had not used her for nearly 2 years.   The dead battery was of no concern to me.
I plugged her into the wall and she sprang to life.
Please rEad my e-mail and say you've readd it before we go on with dict8d hours and such.
But -- for the next several hours -- we did not get along very well.
Ah yes.   For the past 17 minutes -- after gmail dumped me -- I've been trying to get back in here.    Well now I am.
Hi.
I was in the midst of telling you about my problems of spending about an hour and a half trying to load Gmail -- which I was not successful at until 2007 G / 1907 P.
Bummer.
Anyway -- enough of all that.
Do not be surprised if I disappear again.
Hopefully you'll re-appear eventually.  üòâ
However.   Let's set me and my challenges aside for now -- and talk about what you'd like to talk about.          Ok ?
How are you -- and what would you like to chat about ?
Yeah. Please rE-rEad all the messages we've both typed already tonight, then rEad my e-mail, then let's talk about what you think about any of it.
Hold on.   Must go read now.
üòä
Ok -- I have readd the email you sent me at 1844 G / 1744 P (2 hours ago).   ¬∂   I appears to be the letter you had shared with me earlier this week.   ¬∂   I am now going to re-read the text at the top of this chat.   ¬∂   BB-shortly. 
Ok.   Done re-reading.
I can't help you out with getting email addresses.   Sorry.   I only have a few -- and those are the ones that people actually give to me -- that is -- (usually) their own.   Sorry.
Whoops.
Said "sorry" twice.   üòä
Ah well. I may still mail out to street addresses. We'll see, I guess.
        Sometimes -- I am forgetful                     sometimes.
I can be too.
lol
Happens.
Did you get John's Father's address ?
Have you readd Pip.BavL.Org/LMS ?
Was the pic I sent you of John B. ?
I think I did, but haven't hand-written another message to him yet. I didn't see a picture of him.
At the very end of our last chat.   I believe you had left to go to the store before I found them -- and sent them.
Pip.BavL.Org/LMS looks familiar.
Can you give me the whole URL -- or is that it ?
I may have missed one or more pictures of Beppu-san. What about it looks familiar? That is the URL.
I'm going to go (try) to look now.
Hope I don't "get lost" again.
Just "HTTP://" might be necessary before it, depending on your browser DNS and look-up handling.
BBS
Yep.   Thank you.   I needed the "HTTP://" for it.   ¬∂   After a bunch of tries -- got it loaded.
Interesting composition.
A couple of questions.   And (at least) one comment.
Ready ?
Yeah.
Good.
The picture of you -- with the pink background -- is that recent ?
Not sure.
You're a good-looking guy.
üòä
Thanks.
You're welcome                                  I think.
Your "pip.bavl.org/LMS" said:  "2 brothers".    Would that be Tim & John B. ??
Yep.
Good.   Thank you.
The comment is:
If you and John want to manage "The Cove" -- that's fine.
But better count me out.
I'm 857 miles away -- and I've always preferred to do my managing where I could walk around the place myself.
Cool. Just thought you might want to. Fine that you don't.
It would probably be after February, if at all.
Managing real estate is major headaches too.
Get ready for that Pip.
üòä
I had one of those jobs once.
I don't want to go through that twice in one lifetime.
üòä
We'll see.
But I'm not you.
If you want it -- go for it.
I'll support you're decision.
Either way.
Okay, well I think that's what I had for this night's chat. I'm pretty tired and fading out. Let's try again another time?
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
Good Night.
Thank you Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you too.
I hope you and Darjee have a good week.
Good Night Pip.

Hi Dad.
5'11-27-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Shabbat Shalom Philip.
And how went your week ?
Shabbat Shalom Dad.
I'm not sure how to estim8 how my week went right now. How was yours?
A little bumpy -- but generally quite good.
I'm a smiling camper.
Highpoints in your week ?
I was able to enjoy time eating, chatting, and playing some video games with 2 of my local friends yesterday, on ThanksGiving. That was mostly high-points.
That's nice.
Good for you.
üòä
Turkey too ?
Some. Yeah.
Good.
PCA for tonight ?
I haven't thought of any yet. You?
I haven't thought of any yet either.
But -- I suspect I will.
Weather has certainly been an authenticator of "global" warming.
We are still having "September" days -- for the most part.
Ah.
Getting pretty regularly quite cold here.
Snow yet ?
Some temporary snow-fall which stuck for about a day before melting off. Probably much more dumping down soon.
Hmm.
Our entire season total last year was about 6¬Ω inches !!
Sled sales are (pretty much) "in the dumpster !!
Yeah, makes sense.
I miss the winters of my childhood.
What about them do you miss?
The snow.     The sledding.     The snowball tournaments.     The laughter of my friends.
Maybe I should move to Edmonton.
Heh. Maybe.
1304 miles NW of you.
Oh.   That reminds me ...
I'd like to correct an error of mine.
I believe it was in our last chat.
I said that you are 857 miles from me.
That is incorrect.
The correct number is 693.
Okay.
Oshkosh is 693 miles WNW of Reading.
And I then was wondering  :::  why did I say 857 ?
And then it occurred to me --
857 is the number of calories in a hectogram of olive oil.
Healthy for us -- yet.
Ah.
But highly fattening !!
Nearly at the max possible.
No food on earth is greater than 900.
Most (raw) veggies are under 50.
Fruits around 100 (or less).
Breads average about 250 to 280.
Cereals in the high 300s.
Ok.
That's enough of this.
This is not the time for a seminar on nutrition.
üòä
/yet/  /yes/
Okay.
Yep.     I'm ok.     Are you ok ?
Partially, it seems.
What part ain't ?
I'm not feeling optimistic about the likely f8 of humanity right now.
How so -- and why ?
Umm, by anticip8ing a likely acceler8ing decay of minds and bodies worldwide, which may rush huge numbers into their graves soon... and because too much of our species seems to exhibit critical failures of cognition, having exceedingly scarce ability to think and communic8 intelligently, with distressingly widespread inability to apply reason and logic effectively, even for just small (and rel8ively simple) matters.
I certainly concur.
And do you have a plan ?
The beginning of fixing anything -- is to recognize that it is broken.
üòä
I do not yet have any direct plan to resolve such issues. If it 's possible to, I will probably try.
Good.
Your Dad is rooting for you.
Nice.
As are (probably) a few billion others on our planet.
Put on your thinking cap Pip.
                   We need your expertise of mind.
Maybe. It unfortun8ly seems as though even my magnificent mind may prove inadequ8 for identifying the primary core underlying problems, or for discovering what could correct for them, or for properly enacting the precise corrections needed in time to avert the possibly global disaster that seems to be threatening civiliz8ion.
I don't have a problem with that assessment Pip.   ¬∂   Yet -- I suggest this:
Henry Ford had a dream.   He did not know exactly how he was going to go about achieving it.   But he started talking about it with a few close acquaintances.   And it soon became clear to him that he neither had (nor needed) all the "hows" in his own mind.   So -- he did what ?   ¬∂   He gathered unto him -- 8 others -- each of which he regarded as smarter than he.   And --
it worked -- didn't it.
This is the way Pip.
Hmm. Thanks for sharing that.
You're welcome Pip.
All you need is 3 things.
  ‚Ä¢  The vision
  ‚Ä¢  The will to not quit
  ‚Ä¢  The diligence to find those other 8 minds
(//)
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You can do this.
     If you want to.
          If you believe in your self enough.
I may be able to do something productive to help humanity avoid such a tragedy scenario. I *do* want to. I believe in my potential abilities somewhat, but maybe still not enough yet, if self-belief even can prove to be required in some required quantity before any solution that's sufficient can be implemented. We'll see.
s/required quantity/necessary quantity/;
Go on please.
I don't know what else to say about it, for now.
Not important          for now.
The important thing is that it stays
  uppermost in your mind.
    That you chew on it daily.
      And many times per day.
The vision is yours.
  Do not expect that someone else will "take care of it" -- for you.
    You are the appointed one.
      Philip Stuart.
                Get busy Pip.
I may try to, when I can. Tonight is probably not feasible.
You'll know when Pip.
üòä
                      I believe in you.
Cool. Well I'm getting pretty tired and probably need some rest soon. Can we please try to reconnect and chat more another night?
I can't think of any reason why not.
Thank you for tonight Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
         And remember ---
                      I believe in you.
You're welcome. Thank you for tonight too, Dad.
You will do us grreat things --
    and you will start at the very moment when you are ready.
You're welcome.
      You & Dar have a goood week.
I hope you have a goood week too.

Hi Dad.
0'12-06-20 - 2001 Gtime / 1901 Ptime
Sorry I have been sleeping early the past couple nights, and wasn't available to chat at our usual times.
Hello Philip.
Hello. How are you tonight?
I have heard that some sleep is a good idea.
And -- the time of day is not so important.
Evening works for me too sometimes.
How am I ?
              I am glad --
                                 to see you.
That's how I am.
             How are you --
                        and your past week ?
Nice.
Umm I have had some frustr8ions this past week, but they seem to be smoothing out in time.
GOP
(Go On Please)
My best pair of reading glasses had their frames break when I was trying to wipe the lenses clean, but the local Lion's Club has gifted me a voucher to get new glasses after an exam scheduled for the 16th.
Xcellent !!
I'm glad they could do that for you.
üòä
We ‚ù§
 you.
I also have had money issues, with my weekly amount arriving l8. Hopefully it remains usually on-time ahead.
Me -- and your Lion's Club.
Yeah, I'm glad they could help me too.
Kind of them.
My Daddy was a member of the L.C. for many years.
That's cool to know.
I especially remember the Christmas Parties & the annual Summer Gettogether.
Those 2 doos were for the whole family.
Very nice.
Does it usually come on a particular day-of-the-week ?
Yes. Normally $100 gets added to my True-Link debit account very early every Thursday morning shortly after MidNight. This week it didn't arrive until Friday during the day, so about 32 hours l8r than usual. Annoyed me quite a bit.
Are your expenses so tight that a one-day delay makes for a squeeze situation ?
Sometimes. The usual predictability of arriving almost all Thursdays before SunRise has made me probably a bit too reliant on it remaining on-schedule so that I may completely deplete my cash funds on Tuesday or Wednesday, expecting to have more Thursday... but apparently I shouldn't get so comfortable that Thursday will be reliable for me like that.
Hmm.
Yes -- sounds like you "run" a tight walleting procedure.
I understand.
This makes for un-easy breathing -- and diminished health.
Yeah.
I rarely spend $14.29 in a single day --
except like for rent (which covers a month)
-- or food (which is good for a week or 2).
14.29 = 100 / 7
Right on. I could certainly use more money, and hopefully will find some good ways to make a fair amount more eventually. My car started having troubles again today, which is also another frustr8ion for me. Not sure if my Payee will be able to afford to pay any more repair bills, if it will cost more to get fixed. I'll try to find out probably tomorrow.
What is the car malady ?
Battery light on, electrical system clicking and not oper8ing properly, dash indic8or said: "Check Charging System".
As so.
What year is your chariot ?
Probably altern8or / battery issues, which were supposedly both replaced just weeks ago, so hopefully still under window to get replaced with another new one, if needed.
/as so/  /ah so/
I forget. Maybe 2004 or something. I'd have to look it up.
Hmm.
Possibly it is nearing time to jack up your
license plate -- and slip a new automobile
under it.
A 2017 Tesla maybe ?
If I could afford that, yeah... I'd so love to have a Tesla! Yes, please.  üòä
A 3-year-old car is often a good "used" vehicle to go after.
Yeah.
At 3 years old -- it is still in quite good condition -- but
it has depreciated enough to make it very affordable.
I have purchased dozens of cars over the years -- and all except 2 were used.
And -- I soon got into the habit of having my mechanic "look over" the prospective vehicle -- to advise me on whether it had any conditions which should make me "back away" from that particular one.
I've had 2 new Yamaha R6 motorcycles in 2005, but otherwise, all my other vehicles have been used.
Yes -- it cost me a few bucks to do that.
But I always found it to be worth it.
One time -- the problem that he found indicated that maybe I should decline on the purchase -- but then he said that if I could get a substantial reduction on the price -- if might be an ok deal -- as he could repair the deficiency for a few hundred dollars.   I negotiated with the seller (who had not been aware of the car's problem) and we agreed on $1475 -- instead of the $1850 price that he had (at first) quoted to me.   $375 reduction -- more than the cost for my mechanic to fix it !!
I was a happy camper.
üòä
This was one of my MGBs.
Nice!  üòä
The red one -- I believe.
With the roll bar.
You -- and Ange and Tim remember that one well.
Saugus Speedway trips and all.
‚ù§
Yep.
2 (new) R6s in one year.?
What was that about ?
Yep. Crashed NiteMare on ThunderHill race-track mid-Year, so got another while first one needed serious repairs.
I see.
Did the driver's skinsuit need repairs on that incident too ?
Sure did.
Serious concussion and intestinal bruising, mostly healed up after a couple Months.
You look fine to me today.
           How do you feel ?
Today? I'm mostly fine. Have some painful piles from a bit of diarrhea yesterday, but healing up.
üòä
Good.
Yes -- I'm interested in that (toadyish) stuff too.
Thank you.
However -- my question was about any lingerings from 15 years ago.
Do you get diarrhea frequently ?
Ah. No real damage that I know of lingering for 15 Years. No, I usually don't get diarrhea all that frequently.
I'm glad.
Not a fun experience.
I had a concussion once also.
A very interesting experience.
But not that I wish to repeat
(thank you very much).
 
That was in May of 1990.
 
   (white '73 MGB)
The red was a '74.
The yellow was a '68.
The blue was a '65.
I am a big fan of helmets. Mine was probably destroyed, but my head just suffered a serious concussion and thankfully was not split wide-open, as would probably have happened had I not had such an excellent Shoei helmet to protect my noggin that day.
I'm certainly glad that you did.
I was not wearing a helmet in 1990.
And (I believe) it was my noggin that shattered the windshield of the car that had hit me.
Yikes! Ouch.  üòû
So -- my concussion was quite appropriate.
Yikes -- yes.
Ouch -- no.
I went unconscious immediately.
When I woke up (in the hospital) there was disorientation
-- but I don't recall head-ouchy. 
However -- there was some pain in the area of my left ear.
I remember asking the doctor if I was going to lose it.
He said no.
I was happy about that..
üòä
Well can we please try to chat again tomorrow night around 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime?
I can't see any reason why not at this moment.
Let's shoot for that.
Thank you for this chat Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
Have a good Monday Pip.
You're welcome.
I'm still questioning "love" and whether it's a good, meaningful, useful, beneficial, desirable, etc. thing in typical usage and applic8ions... so maybe I can just say that I care about you and your well-being Dad. I'm not sure if I'm loved, or able to love others, for now.
Thanks. You have a good Monday too.
I will if you will.
Keep on questioning & contemplating.
That's good for you.
I'll try. Have a good night, Dad.  üòä
I care for you too Pip.
I shall.
You & Dar do the same.

Hello Dad.
Good Evening Philip.
And how was your Monday ?
It was largely productive, but pretty frustr8ing in some difficult ways too. How was yours?
Mine was Xtremely good.   Very productive.   I'm quite happy with it..
Want to share the difficult parts with me ?
...  and/or the "largely productives ?
I'm struggling to figure out the best approaches to eventually earning additional income without jeopardizing my rel8ive stability too dramatically.
I don't want to waste too much time or effort in directions that are unlikely to eventually prove to have been worthwhile. It's hard to know what those are ahead of time, when my past experiences indic8 that there's likely to remain a gr8 deal of opposition to whatever I try to do to improve my circumstances.
I liked the sound of the Perl job.
Are you still considering that one ?
I got some good code written today though, and hung out with a local friend for a few pleasant hours.
Nice.
üòû
I am starting to look into what sorts of Perl job-openings I might be able to apply for.
Whoops -- I meant:
üòä
Good for you.
You are an expert in that department -- are you not ?
I might also look into becoming a part-time Book-Keeper ahead, instead of focusing on doing more professional Perl-development.
Angie has some experience in bookkeeping -- doesn't she ?
Yes, in many ways I have been (and remain) a software expert, but I have limited experience developing large code-bases that depend on the most popular Perl libraries, modules, and technologies. I may still have a lot to learn to be particularly effective in practical modern Perl-development at a serious corpor8ion.
But the programming pays a bit more substantially than bookkeeping -- yes ?
She most likely has quite a lot of experience in that arena, but she and I do not rel8 well together anymore. She left me and Darj out-to-dry, so I'm pretty sure we've parted ways for a long while ahead and that she has little to offer me, either willingly or unwittingly either.
But learning that additional stuff would not be a challenge above your abilities -- would it ?
I'm sorry.   I wasn't suggesting that you discuss it with her.
Programming would most likely pay a good deal more than Book-Keeping, but I have some terribly frustr8ing earning limit8ions that might be easier to work within making less than software-development would be likely to earn me. We'll see.
It was just an associative comment.
Well.   I will support whatever you choose.
Ah. Okay. Yeah, learning that additional stuff should be scarcely challenging for me, if I am granted any reasonable opportunity to get up-to-speed on it.
My only suggestion might be:
yes -- keep your head in a part of the choosery --
but also strongly consider the yearnings of your heart.
I don't really sense my heart as having any yearnings at all.
Tell them you'll take $35 an hour until you are up-to-speed on the advanced stuff --
and then they can give you the $47 an hours afterwards.
/hours/  /hour/
Some arrangement like that could work. We'll see.
I've noticed one little item I would like to chat more about -- but you are typing.  ‚Ä¢  I want to hear what you have to say first.
Part of my mind very much yearns to devote some significant effort into becoming an eventual YouTube celebrity who produces regular popular video content that enables many people to appreC8 my formidable capabilities... but I'm profoundly discouraged from hoping that I could achieve substantial success in that arena since I've already made such vast breakthroughs and discoveries and accomplishments in my Octology project already, which absolutely nobody is capable of recognizing or appraising as even just worthwhile (much less remarkable, astonishing, awesome, etc.) at all yet.
Nobody seems capable of acknowledging me or my work as exquisite, no matter how incredibly I and it already is.
Hmm.
s/(incredibly I)/$1 already am/;
Yes -- you am !!
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I doubt you do.
Oh ?
Ok.
You may think you do. You write that you do quite often. You scarcely seem to show it meaningfully though.
I stand corrected.
Is it not apparent to you that your abilities (and potentials) are far above me ?
Maybe you're genuinely trying to. At least that may be worth something... and working towards eventually loving me in a way that I can sense and appreC8 and enjoy.
It is readily apparent that my abilities (and potentials) are far above almost (if not absolutely) everyone else.
It's readily apparent to me, but almost nobody else yet.
Just because I am not smart enough to understand your magnificence -- does not mean that I do not recognize it.
It might.
You now are faced with the "trick" of speaking to "the rest of us" in a language that we (of a significantly lesser intellect) are able to comprehend.   ‚Ä¢   Albert had the same problem.   ‚Ä¢   Sometimes he did well at it.   ‚Ä¢   And sometimes -- he didn't.
You're probably correct about that.
Every blessing -- also has a "cursed" side.
Blessings and curses are magic. I don't believe in magic.
But you can figure that part out too.
They are not magic.
Well, unless you're writing Perl. bless is a Perl keyword and Curses is a cursor and text-handling standard library.
You have a high IQ.    That's a blessing.
But generally, yes, bless and curse in typical usage indic8 the belief in a Deity that magically benefits some and harms others. Magic. Bullshit!
You have trouble sharing it in a way that the masses can grasp it.   That's the "curse" side.
Yes, I have an IQ which breaks the scales. This is an asset, and a detriment. Not a blessing or curse. Not magic.
Ok -- I'm fine with that re-wording.
Scratch what I said.
Thanks.
Substitute "asset" and "detriment" instead.
Done.
I'm fine with that.
Thank you Pip.
You're welcome.
üòä
üòä
I really like when you're reasonable. It's nice of you to be. It warms my attitude toward you, and encourages me that we have beneficial kinship, kind sentiments, and some positive mutual affection... and hope of getting even closer and better rel8d to each other.
I may be, and remain, enigmatic and unloved... but I am pretty sure there are many more important things than love. It may prove inessential and unnecessary to me.
Or for me.
1'12-07-20 - 2049 Gtime / 1949 Ptime
Sorry.
Gmail dumped me again.
Took multiple tries to get back in.
But I'm here now.
üòä
It's okay. I know it happens sometimes. Probably you should switch to a GNU/Linux distribution like Ubuntu someday, so that your GMail will no longer be at all likely to crap out like yours too often does.
I was crafting a comment when I got dumped.
But maybe it can w8 until next month.
üôÇ
It's probably due to your MicroSoft Oper8ing-System and Web-Browser having crashing bugs when dealing with Google's GMail JavaScript code (which probably carefully adheres to well-established standards).
Probably.
Free-Software such as GNU/Linux is almost always far more stable and well-behaved than typical commercial For-Profit proprietary software.
Please feel free to re-craft your comment, instead of w8ing until next Month.
Makes  ¬¢  to me.
When your primary users tend to be software-developers themselves who have rel8ively easy access to the underlying source-code of every major aspect of their oper8ing environments, we usually demonstr8 ourselves to be exceptionally technically competent at fixing issues, squashing bugs, making things secure, adding useful fE8ures, etc..
Yep.   I get it.   The pressures of general commercialism -- do not encourage their software programmers to do things "well" -- just do it "good enough" to get-it-to-market.   And then -- get working on the next version which we have targeted to release in another 18 months.   I understand that.   It's a shame -- but it is the way it is --  --
for now.
I'm pretty sure that Octology is poised to eventually overturn the status-quo as far as commercial versus Free-Libre-Open-Source-Software (FLOSS) will be concerned.
There is a day coming -- when this will all change.
Yes.
I expect that Octology will prove instrumental in such changes.
But -- don't look for it in the next week or two !!
It may not be time yet... but I'm pretty sure that if serious progress in that direction is not made prior to October 13th of 2021, then the f8 of almost all humans alive on this planet will become probably quite significantly far more bleak than could have otherwise been.
What is the significance of that particular date please ?
My apartment becomes 21 on the day before that (to me).
I moved in on Oct 12 2000.
I started coding Octology in 2013. It was developed in priv8 for approxim8ly 4 whole Years. I shared whatever I could with only close family and friends during that time. Then I made my first public release of the code onto GitHub.Com on d8:HAD (October 13th of 2017). On d8:LAD (Oct. 13th of 2021) it will have been 8 total Years of work on Octology, 4 priv8, 4 public. I'm pretty sure it's an inevitably profound dead-line of sorts for the whole world to start "getting-with-the-program" or suffering some increasingly severe consequences for ignoring what has become increasingly fundamental to life, survival, and adapt8ion themselves.
I see.   That makes sense.   Thank you for explaining.
You're welcome.
Hmm.
Your "baby" and my "baby" are nearly the same age.
Your "baby" is "Fix-the-Radio"?
Yes.   Your "baby" is "Octology".
The "FTR" conception was in February of 2012.
The company was officially registered in August of 2015.
The most core found8ional component of Octology is the ~/dox/2du/8.utf file which was primarily started on d8:D6R (June 27th of 2013).
That file is now 4,888 lines long and very unlikely to grow in line-count any further from that threshold. I may flesh-out much more of the interior of the file eventually, but it probably won't have any whole new lines appended to it anymore (or any removed from it anymore either). It's probably pretty frozen, rather indefinitely.
Why is that ?
Because sometimes alignment with certain boundaries (like a number of lines ending in "888") becomes an approprE8 limit on what the particular file was originally conceived of to accomplish.
Ok.   Thank you.
          You were going to add more to that comment ?
Probably from now on, further growth will happen in other files, leaving 8.utf mostly unaltered for the foreseeable future.
It describes 1,391 official 8-words, each broken into 4 potential parts. Each has an 8 in their new spellings. Every 8 is preceded by a "Precursor-Letter". Then most also have a prefix which comes before the Precursor-Letter. Some also include a suffix which trails after the 8. These 4-part break-downs of every 8-word in the list fit into categories of Precursor-Letters such that there are 3-3-4-3-3-4-3-3-2-3-3-1 differently sized groups that were deliber8ly clustered together numerically.
Ok.
Thank you.
At the bottom of: HTTPS://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology/blob/master/gfx/sho/Octology-8plc-shot_1454x977-I9MM6MMI.png you can see most of the Precursor-Letter groups sorted in descending size, with r8 words being the solo 1 with 212 entries, then the 3 of c8, l8, and n8 words each have 148 entries, then the 3 of E8, t8, and z8 each have 110 entries, then 2 g8 and m8 words are 55 each, then 3 d8, p8, v8, then 3 b8, s8, u8, then 4 C8, D8, L8, N8, then 3 R8, U8, V8, then another 3, then 4, then 3, then final smallest 3.
What is your plan to "have happen"
on Wednesday, October 13, 2021 ?
From 212 down to 8 ?
If Octology does not get recognized by LAD, then I will probably start seriously planning to shift from being a benevolent and generous developer to a malevolent and devast8ing one. If nobody on this planet can recognize excellence by that dead-line, then maybe many will eventually have to actually literally die to make way for a brighter future afterward.
LAD is ?
Yes, the 1-3-3-2-3-3-4-3 (-3-4-3-3) span from the top largest r8 group having 212 entries down to the R8, U8, and V8 groups each having 8 members. The last smallest 3 group is comprised of only 1 single entry in each.
d8:LAD is October 13th of 2021. d8:HAD was October 13th of 2017 (which, as I already typed, was the first public release of the code).
Gotcha.   Thank you.
I understand LAD & HAD.
We formed the FTR company on F88.
At 2030 in the evening.
In what time-zone?
Romeo.
Running `d8 F88NKU` from my GNU/Linux command-line yields:
  "Sat Aug  8 20:30:00:00 -0400 2015"
I believe that is correct -- yes.
If you look at the bottom of: HTTPS://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology/blob/master/gfx/sho/Octology-8plc-shot_1614x952-I6PMAPS8.png  you can see the whole list of Precursor-Letter groups.
That's how it looked back on June 25th of 2018. Changed slightly since then.
I've loaded that link -- but am not sure where I should be looking.   Help ?
Look toward the bottom along the left side, where there are Yellow groups of Pre-cursorLetters starting with the smallest (OSy), then larger (IMP), then (Bhkw), etc. up to (r).
Ah yes.   Thank you.   I see them.   But --
only the first 11 lines -- up to "cln".
The r8 line at the bottom is partially trunc8d.
The 12th line is cut in half -- and that is the bottom of what shows.
Yep.
How many lines should there be ?
Just those 12.
Oh.   Ok.
You had asked what time zone I am in.   I said "Romeo" (R).
You are in "Sierra" (S) -- correct ?
I don't know zones by such letters or names. I know them by EST, EDT, CST, CDT, MST, MDT, PST, PDT, or -0400, -0500, -0600, -0700, -0800 as offsets from UTC or GMT.
Ah so.   Those letters are from my military training.
R = EST -0500 winter
R = EDT -0400 summer
S = CST -0600 winter
S = CDT -0500 summer
Does that help ?
California is "Uniform" (U) time.
Yep. Thanks. That helps.
You're welcome.
I was first taught that system in South Carolina (Romeo) time.
And my advanced training was in California (Uniform) time.
Madison WI is (Sierra).
Denver CO is (Tango).
I get it.
Good.   I knew you would.
üòä
You ain't no dip Pip.
So I just have 1 PCA item for tonight.
Me too.
You go first ?
Can you please do whatever it takes to plan on visiting me here in OshKosh from Monday, February 8th through to the following Tuesday, February 16th of 2021? John Beppu-san said he probably will be able to make it here for that time. I'm hoping that maybe Tim and 1 or more of my Uncles will be able to attend as well.
Have you heard back from Tim on your recent communication to him ?
Not yet. Nor from any Uncles yet either. Only Beppu-san said he can probably come from Feb. 8th - 16th. I'd very much like for you to be here during that period as well... even if Tim and Uncles can't make it.
And/or your uncles & p-uncles ?
Oh.
You already answered that last Q.   Thank you.
Ask me again -- 'round mid-January please.   Will you ?
Why w8 until then? It should be easier to plan travel and lodging logistics earlier rather than l8r.
Ok.   If you want an answer now -- it would have to be a "no".
Sorry.
Why can't you get here for that time?
In April -- I bought my mask -- and started limiting my going outside of my apartment.
And I stuck with that plan from April through September.
In October -- the "covid" thing started to "go through the ceiling" -- and I put my "going out" guidelines into even more stringent limitations.
If you believed (as you have indic8d before) that CoViD-19 was God's wrath pouring out as punishment for people re-marrying, why do you worry about it if you're not such an offender?
A few weeks ago -- a close friend surrendered his skinsuit -- and I really wanted to attend the services -- as many of my other friends were expected to be there -- and I felt that I wanted to support them.
But -- I stayed home -- watched the services online -- and corresponded with my friends instead.   ‚Ä¢   I was not happy about this.   But it seemed the right thing to do.
So -- the idea of an airplane trip in Feb is most probably a "no-no".
Sorry.
I miss seeing you too.
Sorry you lost a close friend and couldn't provide in-person support for your remaining friends.
But -- 'twon't be forever Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
Thank you for your sentiments.   But it was time for him.   He got 85+ years on this planet -- and he had a wonderful life.
Okay. Well maybe I can ask again mid-January. If a successful vaccine is released by January, would you probably then be able to make it here in February?
I'm certainly willing to chat about it again.   Thank you.
Now.   Would you like a comment on one of your comments inside this discussion ?
Sure.
Ok.
Thank you.
Here comes.
You said:
If you believed (as you have indic8d before) that CoViD-19 was God's wrath pouring out as punishment for people re-marrying, why do you worry about it if you're not such an offender?
I do remember that subject being discussed by us a while ago -- yes.   ‚Ä¢   However -- I (apparently) had not made my self clear.   ‚Ä¢   Sorry Pip.   ‚Ä¢   My bad.   Let's see if I can correct that now.
Okay.
#1 - I'm not entirely sure -- but I don't think I have ever used the word "wrath" in the past 77 years.
#2 - I do not believe that Our Father ever "punishes" us.
#3 - CoVid-19 is a gift (see Piece #27) -- and the contracting of its virus is not only limited to people who have re-married -- but is also gifted to many who have not re-married.
#4 -- The CDC says "stay at home" majorly -- unless you really need to go out.
I think those are the main things I wanted to say Pip.
(//)
Ah. Hmm. I must've gotten the wrong impression then. Maybe you said something like "judgment" instead of "wrath". I may have inapproprE8ly confl8d the two. Could have been my bad.
A Father who doesn't punish sounds to be little like a normal "father" to me, in general.
I don't recall using "judgment" either.
But -- I suspect that (often) when I use the word "gift" -- your "take" on God is such that you probably believe that IF He does actually exist -- then (certainly)  :::  He is not a nice guy -- and He does lousy things to us.
Is that (approximately) correct ?
(//)
Yes. I have lots of reasons to believe that if a "God" exists, He is probably quite evil, not nice, and does as many lousy things to us as He can find ways to do so.
We might discuss that further (sometime) too.
Maybe it's even a lie that it's actually a "He". Maybe it's a "She" more than man-like.
However -- I also wanted to comment on your saying:
A Father who doesn't punish sounds to be little like a normal "father" to me, in general.
I entirely agree with that statement Pip.
The pastors and priests and so many others in the clergy over the centuries have "held" and certain preached of a wrathful God.   ‚Ä¢   Shame on them.   ‚Ä¢   They do not know Him.
That will (also) change.
But -- don't expect that either -- in the next week or two !!
Ok.   I'll address the He/She thing too.
Doesn't the Bible supposedly chronicle all sorts of God's wrath throughout the history of the Jewish people, as well as New Testament RevL8ion describing eschatological wrath being poured out on most of the end-times gentiles as well?
The Godhead (The Trinity) functions as 3 persons -- even though (in truth) -- the 3 are really One.   Just One God.
#1 - Father
#2 - Son (which means"proof")
#3 - The Wholey Spirit
The (#1) "acts" as if a man -- thus -- the name "Father".
I'm pretty sure that "son" means "male child" much more than it could mean merely "proof", but carry on.
The (#3) Wholey Spirit "acts" as a woman.
The (#2) "acts" (approximately half of the time) as a man -- and half of the time -- as a woman.   The Father's Son (Philip) acts as a man.   The Father's Son (Angie) acts as a woman.
Does this maybe help ?
          A little ?
If God "acts" as if a man, who may have a "Son", but does not punish as a "Father" should and would, why does it make much sense to refer to Him as "Father" instead of just "God" or something more identifiable and distinct and descriptive instead?
You're still typing.
       I w8.
I think if there is a "God-the-Father", it actually lies and slaughters and calls evil to be good and vice-versa, much more as women are likely to than men in most cases.
I think "Son" means male. "Daughter" would indic8 female. I don't think Angie is a "Son".
I think women also tend to long to be praised and worshipped, like God seems to. This is another reason why I suspect the old God of the Bible is actually more female than male, if gendered meaningfully at all.
The word "daughter" means "carrier".
In my dictionaries, "son" means male-child, not proof... and "daughter" means female-child, not carrier. I just checked.
Of course you did.
And you (and your dictionary) is correct.
The primary job of a lexicographer (a dictionary maker) is to report on how a word is used by the general populace -- that is -- the different ways that a word is used in speech and writings -- and what that word is intended to mean -- when spoken and/or written.
However --
a dictionary's purpose is not to dig deeply into the original meaning of the word itself -- in spite of the fact that some dictionaries do attempt to do so -- yet only in a very cursorial way.  
If a word like "son" originally meant "proof" -- but a very scant portion of the English-speaking population (today) continues to use it that way -- the lexicographer "drops" that definition -- as his job is to report on usage -- not original meaning.
The most prevalent usage (today) of the word "son" -- means:  a male child.
So -- that's what the "lexi" reports to us.
My dictionaries actually *do* include all sorts of original etymologies with almost every entry though.
You are right Pip.
The "better" dictionaries do give (some) etymological stuff -- and also (sometimes) a little morphological tidbits too.   But usually very little -- and very rarely enough to really "get down into" the meat of the origins -- because -- that is not the lexicographer's primary job -- and if they truly tried to do that part well -- the average college dictionary would weigh 30 or 40 pounds -- instead of 5 or 6 !!
The word "son" originally meant "proof".
If you don't like that -- that's entirely ok.
99+% of the English-speakers in the world agree with you.
Your Dad is the oddball here.
I care about original meanings.
Why ?
Okay, so even assuming, for the sake of argument, that son originally meant proof and daughter meant carrier, how are either of those sufficiently descriptive concepts for each term which would give rise to the modern interpret8ions of them as purely family role delinE8ions?
Because I like to study writings which are 2000 or 3000 years old --
Yeah, I know. Most theists do too, like you.
Proof and carrier don't seem to be gendered terms.
and when I ask "supposedly" learned people what things from back then really mean -- I have found that they share with me the fables that their "fable-filled teachers" filled their convoluted minds with.
              No thank you.
Since we're into this -- I shall go on a little.
The Bible is over-flowing with fables, which have convoluted many minds throughout the Millennia (including yours).
A boy-child (son) and a girl-child -- are also frequently referred to as:
          "children".
Acknowledged.
"Kids" or "youth" or "youngsters" too.
So -- it is entirely appropriate for a boy to alternately (simply) be called (a child) -- especially when the gender does not seem particularly important.
Agreed.
Likewise -- a girl is also alternately called a child.
The word "child" is frequently (and appropriately) defined as "an animal's offspring" --
especially when the parents are humans.
"Progeny" too, I'm pretty sure.
You are correct -- yes.     Progeny is a primary synonym for "offspring".
But -- if we take this further -- you will also find that (in the many definitions of the word "child" in the dictionary) -- the word "child" can apply to anything that a person creates.  
The parents of a baby are customarily held to be the "creators" of their little bundle of joy.  
Yet too -- if your are an architect -- your "building" is your child.
If a computer programmer -- Octology is your child.
If a teacher on Personal Development -- FTR is your child.
If a song-writer -- your tunes are your children.
I believe you get the idea.
Your "child" -- no matter what form it may take -- if your legacy.
Your creation -- is the proof that you were here.
That you existed.
Michaelangelo is nowhere to be found.
And no one who ever saw his is around to say that he existed.
But -- on a ceiling in a southern-European country -- is his proof.
His child is painted on that ceiling.
Of course I can go on with this for another 4 or 5 days (at least) --
but I believe you have it by now.
Sort of. What about "carrier"?
                  son / child / offspring / creation     means     proof
Ok.   carrier
       To the woman of our species is assigned the task of taking the seed of a man -- and merging it with the egg within her -- and then carrying that mergement of their proof (of having once lived) -- until the child's skinsuit is sufficiently developed to be delivered out into the air --  to breathe on its own.
No man can ever be proven to have lived -- without a carrier of his proof.
(//)
/if your legacy/    /is your legacy/
/saw his/   /saw him/
I beg to differ. I think proof means sufficient evidence of some sort. You already indic8d that a painted ceiling proves the artist lived. Was the chapel his female "carrier", ceiling canvas her ovum, and Michaelangelo's paints and strokes his "seed"? I think a child might be proof of having had sexual intercourse (except for the rather poignantly conspicuous counter-example of the purported "virgin-birth" of the supposedly miraculous and holy "Son-of-God"). I think plenty of people can rel8ively easily be proven to have lived, even though they sired no children. Did you mean that, as your conclusion? So "carrier" just means basically impregnable womb holder or something like that in your concepts here?
You may hold it to be that -- yes.
The word "daughter" is not a terribly important won.
Maybe "child" could have had origins in some phrasing like "proof of a man and woman having copul8d together", but "son" is a poor term to use for this since it's overwhelmingly gendered as unambiguously indic8ing male-ness... and "son" should not be thought of as merely the non-specific term "proof" in isol8ion. Too vague!
Most people do not care what it originally meant -- and they use it simply to mean "a female child" -- and that's fine with me.   ‚Ä¢   But the word "son" IS important.    Most people have little problem with being called a "child" of God.   But when someone suggests that they are a "son" of God -- those same "majority" get violently opposed to that idea.   ‚Ä¢   son          simply means        proof.
Proof of what specifically though?
Proof is a much broader general concept and term than just being one indic8ing having produced a baby.
Other languages and their variations of "son"  :::   sen  bar  ben  -- they go on and on.   They all mean "son".
I (being partly Jewish) am the proof of Abraham (having lived).
Abraham is the proof of Adam having lived.
Adan is the proof of God.
Adam is the proof of God.
    (spelling corrected)
And therefore -- I am the proof of God.
So is Angie.
And Tim.
If most men throughout history have not produced children while most women have, why should children be thought of as providing meaningful proof of having lived? Billions of men can be proven to have lived, in spite of them not having any kids.
And Katy.
It's not about proving me.
It's about the proof of God.
Umm, you're making big leaps there. There's no evidence there was ever an Adam, anything like the man who was told about in the conflicting crE8ion fables in the Bible. Avraham, probably yes, did live. Adam, probably no. God probably no. We are not adequ8 proof of Adam or God having lived.
If you have no children -- and Angie has no children -- and Tim & Mandy's 4 children have no children -- then 200 or 300 years from now -- there will be no breathing proof of my having lived.   And that's fine.   I don't care.
This "son" thing is not about an "afterproof" of any one of us.   The point is that any living (breathing-at-the-moment) person -- is the proof of the existence of The Father -- (God).
That is what the whole "Son of God" is all about.
Yeshua is not the Son of God.
He was.  
But he is no longer.
Yeshua gave up that job (of being the Father's proof).
Yeshua was supplanted in that occupation by Tim -- and Angie.
Your Mom saw to that happening.
(//)
I totally disagree. Living beings probably have emerged naturally over billions of conducive Years. Living beings are no proof of any God definitively existing. We have no credible evidence that there was any God who actually crE8d life originally, nor would there need to have been any God, logically, for life to exist at present. God is not proven to exist. Neither is the fable of Adam or any Garden of Eden proven to have existed in reality either. They're fictional origin stories that gullible people who have faith in the inerrancy of the Bible swallow hook-line-and-sinker which describe magical golem spells of man being fashioned from dirt, the breath-of-life blown into his nostrils, and a rib of his taken during sleep to form a woman companion from (back when primitive people knew so little about human physiology that they mistakenly believed men had one fewer ribs than women did, which was never the case).
I love what you have just said there Pip.
There are many other people who believe essentially the same things.
Not a majority of the 7.6 billion people who are now breathing.
       But -- nevertheless -- many of them.
Are you -- and your co-believers wrong ?
I say no.
And -- I hope that you hold on to those beliefs.
And chew on them.
As I both know that your do --
     and also that you will.
You are on the right track Pip.
I applaud you.
        And I am proud of you.
I ‚ù§
 you.
It might be the majority of people that actually do *not* believe the Bible crE8ion story to be true. Probably most living people believe in either different conflicting crE8ion stories or believe in Evolution primarily instead... but it doesn't matter much what the majority thinks. The majority can clearly be wrong about what may, or may not, have occurred thousands or millions of Years ago.
No 2 people have ever / do now / or will ever -- believe the same things.
It does not matter what any one else believes.
What you believe is the only important thing.
Wrong.
If what you believe -- works for you -- hold on to it.
It does matter what others believe. What "you" ("I") believe is *not* the only important thing.
If what you believe brings you peace. -- stick with it.
Untruths and fables that others believe in as if they were accur8 history governs their behaviors, which have an impact on those they encounter and impact.
That's true.
How is what you believe impacting others ?
And I am not asking that of you -- for (to tell) me.
You have no one to answer to other than your own self.
Each person is the God of their own self.
If their God is terrible -- they shall be terrible.
If their God is kind -- they shall be kind.
Most members of faith-communities do share the majority of their doctrinal dogmatic beliefs in common with their fellow parishioners. Maybe no 2 people can believe in absolutely exactly and entirely the literally "same" things, but for most intents and purposes, Christians believe in common concepts of Trinity, Jesus being blameless and dying for all others' sins, His rising from the dead within 2 or 3 Days, salv8ion, baptism, prophecy, Heaven, Hell, etc..
If their God does not exist -- they shall have to be the lord (boss) of their self.
I don't think each person is the God of their own self.
What ever works for that person -- is by the choices of that person.
My God lives within me.
If I am deluding myself -- I am the recipient of that delusion.
Most Christians believe in a God concept that is external to themselves (except the Holy Spirit supposedly dwells within their hearts sort of, or something like that), but no each person is not the God of their own self.
Yeshua said that he and his father were a single being.
I say the same thing.
I know others who say that too.
I don't have a God. I am not the God of my own self. I am a man, primarily, and not a God.
I know others who say that is impossible.
It's ok.
Each person gets to decide.   Each is his (or her) own boss (lord).
Axiom #18 says so.
I agree Pip.   You are not a God.  
To some varying extents, yeah each person is a sort of boss (and lord) over their own beliefs.
You are thee God.
There is only One.
Definitionally, a God ought to be at least as capable as a man, and also super-human in one or more ways (usually including being immortal). I am not the God. There probably isn't even One actual God.
If you call 8 billion people all One God, or a Trinity comprised of 3 personages which are together components of an entirely unified singular God identity, you're simply destroying the meanings of words in your mind and in the minds of others you corrupt. Billions of individual living organisms are not accur8ly described as actually only being "One". Neither is 3 simply just 1. You're illogical and in denial about what different numbers mean, describe, specify, design8, indic8, delinE8, segment8, partition8, isol8, sepR8, etc..
I have a question.
Puedo ?
Yes.
Do you want there to be a God ?         [ ]  yes        [ ]  no
Depends quite a lot on what a God is, and is not, and who God is, and how God is, and where God is, and when God is. I scarcely expect that whatever I might want regarding a God's existence ought to matter much at all. Either there is one or more Gods that exist, or there are none. I want to know what was, what is, and hopefully some ability to anticip8 what eventually might come about. Whether or not a God exists, I would most prefer to just know the truth of that matter... and if a God *does* exist, I'd like to become able to gain a clearer and increasingly accur8 understanding of such a God's character, intentions, motiv8ions, abilities, limit8ions, values, and morals (among many other things).
Well -- a good -- and very comprehensive answer.
But -- I does not answer the question.
May I try again ?
Another question ?
Puedo ?
Well please define a God first, then.
I can't.
Let's use your definition of what God is.
If you clarify what a God is, and what it would mean for there to be one of them, or not, then I could better answer whether I want there to be one.
How do you define what a God is -- if there were such a thing ?
Probably a being that is at least as good as an average man in almost every way, but also much more powerful than any man in at least one way too.
"good" there meaning "capable".
Ok.   Let's go with that definition.       Ok ?
Okay, but it probably matters very much in what way a God is more powerful than any man (or every man combined). Care to suggest how you conceive of satisfying that crucial qualific8ion?
Not yet.              But soon.             Can we wait on that part (for now) ?
We can try.
Good.
My question is coming.
It is multiple choice.
There are 4 choices.
The 5th choice is not available.
The 5th choice is "none of the above".
       But that choice is not being listed.
#5 is not available -- not choosable.
Here is the question:
           How many Gods would you like there to be ?
                         [  ]  one    [  ]  a few    [  ]  many    [  ]  none
Well I'm inclined to assume at least one of a God's super-human tr8s is being immortal. Under that assumption, I would probably prefer there to be none of such beings in actuality. I doubt an eternal being can have much respect or regard for mortal lives.
Living eternally is probably almost never, if ever, a good thing to exist.
I guess this was my fault.
The essay question comes a bit later.
Maybe I was not clear about that part.
I seem to see you leaning toward one of those 4 choices -- but I thing you need to tell me for sure please.
How many Gods would you like there to be ?
          [  ]  one    [  ]  a few    [  ]  many    [  ]  none
If a God must be immortal, I'd probably prefer there to be none of them.
Good.
Now -- I would ask you if that is your final answer -- but in light of your prefacing "qualifier" -- I must tell you that YOU are the one who said that -- if there is a God -- that God must be immortal.   I never suggested such a thing.
So -- would you like to stick to the "none" answer -- because a God must be immortal -- or -- would you prefer to say that a God need not be immortal -- and try the question again ?
Which ?
I might have become somewhat immortal, though... so the issue might be rather complex. If I am both a man and a God, then in that case I would prefer that there be one God, which is me.
Ok.   So let me see if I have this right.
You want to change your answer from "none" to "one".
        Is that correct ?
If I am an immortal God (in addition to being primarily a man), then yes, I would prefer there be at least one God (which is me).
I got it.     And I also believe I understand all of your conditions and qualifications.
                 So.            Your final answer is  :::  one ?
Conditionally, if I am a God (and man), then my answer is "one or more".
"one or more" is not in the list of choices.
The only thing that answer does is eliminate the "none" answer.
You need to pick from the other 3.
              [  ]  one    [  ]  a few    [  ]  many   
I guess then I should answer "few" since it would probably be better for there to be at least one other immortal, if I happen to be. Another similar being existing which I could rel8 to and hopefully engage with in mutually beneficial and symbiotic ways.
You have chosen          "a few".
           Is that your final answer ?
Assuming I'm an immortal God, then yes, for now, I'd prefer there to be at least one other being that is like me in that way... so yeah: "a few" probably.
I'm hearing you leaning strongly toward "a few" --
Yes.
but the word "probably" suggests that you are not (yet) certain that that is your final answer.
So.         I shall ask you again.   
Is "a few" your final answer ?
For now, it is. There are plenty of imaginable scenarios for which I would wish to change my answer, but for now "a few" should suffice.
So  --  for now  --  "a few"  is your final answer ?
Yes.
Good.
Are you sure ?
It still very much depends on the peculiarities of any specific circumstance and the assoC8d consequences of different choices.
That stuff can all be specified later (by you).
Is  "a few"  your final answer ?
For now.
Yes -- for now.
Is  "a few"  your final answer -- for now ?
Yes. Why do you have to call it a "final" answer, when I keep asserting that there can't be a meaningfully final answer when the question itself is poorly formul8d.
s/formul8d./formul8d?/;
Because you need to decide whether you wish (for now) to change it.
Is  "a few"  the answer you definitely want to go with -- for now ?
Well I can easily come up with plenty of reasonable cases for which I would wish to change my answer. Calling an answer "final" for a question that is only nebulously and unclearly specified should be understandably conditional and approprE8 to equivoc8 over.
I'll accept that.
I withdraw the question.
Fine.
lol
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
So did you still have a PCA item you'd like us to get into tonight?
Yep.
Now ?
Sure.
Ok.
Thank you.
Here it comes.
 
When you signed off last night with:
KC6LKBIG
-- I had to smile.  KBIG was an easy-listening
radio station in Los Angeles in the 1970s.
 
But it also reminded me that I've been wanting
to ask you about those 8 characters.  I'm pretty
sure I've got 7 of them nailed.  Please confirm
or correct me.  But I don't know how to interpret
#4.  Can you help me on that one please ?
 
K = year
C = month
6 = date
L =  ??
K = hour
B = minute
I = second
G = 1/60s of a second
Yes. 4th is my version of time-zone.
From my command-line: `d8 KC6LKBIG` yields:
  "Sun Dec  6 20:11:18:16 -0600 2020"
L is a 12 -- right ?
How does that identify your -0600 time zone ?
In the zone field, UpperCase "L" (decimal 21) is -0600 hours offset from UTC / GMT. "M" is -0500 off.
I'm confused.
An upper-case L is ASCII 76.
I'm not understanding (decimal 21) apparently.
Can you help me out here ?
Yes. I don't use ASCII values for the character to number mappings. They are in my Base64 format instead.
They span 0..9, A..Z, a..z, then dot (.), and underscore (_).
UpperCase "L" is 21.
A = 10
Z = 35
Yes ?       No ?
Yes.
Ok -- I'm with you.     L = 21
In the zone field, 0..9, and A..E (10..14) are positive offsets from UTC. Then neg8ive offsets go backwards from Q down to F (26 down to 15).
Now -- how does 21 translate to -0600 Zulu (GMT) ?
Maybe you can see the basic code at: HTTPS://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology/blob/ebb3ad84a08c1dc0736e74b7b7e667d4afeba435/lib/Octology/d8.pm#L42
What line number am I looking for please ?
At the end of that code-line, you should see the "for(0..14)" which sets up the positive offsets in the earliest d8a values. In the middle, you may see the "for(15..26)" which does the neg8ive offsets. Then on the lines above, you may notice that those extra entries run from R (27) to g (42) with offsets that are not whole integer hours offset from UTC / GMT.
Line 42 has the for loops I just design8d.
Lines 26 through 41 show the partial-hour offsets that I discovered also needed to be supported somehow, without being able to be mapped at all directly to whole integer hour offsets from UTC. So they're just the set of special-case zone encoding entries that run from 27 on up to 42.
Good.   Thank you Pip.
You're welcome.
You might also be somewhat interested in the maps between all the standardized zone multi-letter abbreV8ions which each refer to the integer index numbers which have already been defined in those 3 blocks of 0..14 positive offsets, backwards from 26 down to 15 neg8ive offsets, and finally 27..42 all the non-integer special-case offsets. There are comments masking out the overloaded names I encountered, which I had to select among to pick sane defaults without ambiguity.
My PCA's down to 0.
Yours ?
Comments in which line numbers ?
Thank you for asking about my d8 format. I would really like for you to understand and appreC8 it and be able to use it beneficially someday.
Comments are on lines 45, 49, 52..66
I believe I (pretty well) understand it -- and I appreciate it for its conpactness and its accuracy.
Actually line 51 is commented out too. Comments follow from the pound-sign, hash, octothorpe, tic-tac-toe, splat, number-sign, etc. characters and span until the end-of-line.
I'm going to look at lines 45, 49, 52 to 66 now.
BBSh.
Yeah, my d8 format can describe 60ths-of-a-second precision spanning 1024 Years (from Jan. 1st 1489 through Dec. 31st 2511) in exactly 8 Base64 characters.
Xcellent Pip.
You have a plan for 2512 ?
Sager & Evans had a song about 2525.
Not a concrete one yet. I'm probably leaning in either of 2 directions: start using Base256 characters instead of just Base64 (which would add 16 new bits of precision to be able to be used to enable the Year field to span something close to 65,536 times 512 Year blocks being applied before or after the central Year 2000... or another altern8ive would be to just add another 8 or 56 additional Base64 characters so that there can be plenty of room to grow both the span of Year ranges that can be supported and also provide even finer-grained sub-second precision than "phasses" (my 60ths-of-a-second name of combining "phases" with "passes").
It was #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart up until the day before Mom & I had our first date on Sunday, August 17, 1969.
Title was:  "In the Year 2525".
Sounds like a good plan to me.
I'll get back to you about that in about 492 years Pip.
Thanks. I'm open to even better ideas and suggestions coming about hopefully well before it becomes urgent to upgrade the usable range, yeah in about 492 Years.  üòâ
üòä
I'll be here.
Probably not on this computer though.
The d8 format fields are described by UpperCase for traditional "dates" and lowercase for "times" so it's:  "YMDzhmsp"
Are you planning to supplant Microsoft ?
Yes.
Eventually, hopefully, yes.
Good.   They need you.
Bill was a good man -- but in his later years there -- he missed a few things.
I have maybe one other PCA item that I'd like to bring up tonight, if you aren't too tired?
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
No -- I'm only kidding.
Go ahead please.
Could God Be Evil?
Could God Be Evil?
Can you please take 17 minutes and 10 seconds to watch:  HTTPS://YouTu.be/xLnsY5io964 "Could God Be Evil?" # KC4:HA0 of CosmicSkeptic explaining Cambridge's StephenLaw's gr8 Evil-God Challenge;  ... and then reply to let me know whatever you might think about it afterward?
I'd rather talk with you.
Okay.
What did you think of it ?
You gave me that link before -- didn't you.
I thought it was quite compelling and significant, which could possibly inform both yours and my thinking about potential n8ures of various possible good / evil alignments of God.
I doubt it.
The video just went up about 4 Days ago.
Sure sounds familiar.
Yes -- on Friday -- you're right.
But I've heard him before -- I know that.
Did you draw any conclusions from it ?
His name is Alex O'Connor I think, and his channel is called "CosmicSkeptic" and he's from the U.K..
Yep.   For sure.
Yes, that there are pretty clearly powerful inverted theodicies which seem to me to be just as valid logically as the originals, and taken together probably rather profound implic8ions that if there is a God, it is unlikely to be omnipotent, as is traditionally assumed and expected.
s/probably/have probably/;
Hmm.
Alex sounds a lot like you.
Thanks! That's a nice compliment.  üòä
Are you sure you didn't write his script for him ?
Pretty sure.
Ok.
Well -- are we about ready to wrap for tonight ?
Good chat -- thank you.
I think we can be. Yeah. Very good chat! Thank you so much for everything we were able to discuss so productively tonight. I gr8ly enjoyed most of it.
Me too.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're welcome.
üòä
You and Darjee have a good week.
Thanks. We probably will. I hope you enjoy a good week too.
Thank you Pip.
Look for you Fri Dec 11 2020 ?
Yeah. Let's plan on chatting again then.
Zounds lyke a plan.
Or feel free to e-mail me if you'd like to chat about anything even sooner than Friday. My schedule is usually pretty flexible and your interest in my d8 format inclines me to be more glad to make even more regular time for you, should you want me to.
Thank you.
No problem.  üòâ
My Tera is in for service -- but Sammi (laptop) is getting the "chat" job done pretty nicely.
Good.
Are we lingering for a reason ?
Probably not.
lol
KC8L2525
But we are lingering.
Good night Pip.
Good night Dad.  üòä

2'12-08-20 - 0305 Gtime / 0205 Ptime
KCBLJ2pi
Hi Dad. Shabbat Shalom.  üòä
5'12-11-20 - 2003 Gtime / 1903 Ptime
Shabbat shalow Philip.
And how were your past 4 days ?
Rather mixed, but mostly pretty good. Thanks. How were yours?
Mine were quite productive.   Thank you for asking.
I am into my annual "mailing" project now.
üòä
Tell me about your "mixed" please.
Cool. I hope your annual "mailing" project goes well.
Me too.   Thank you.
I do not have Tera back from "getting serviced" yet.
When I do -- that will help quite a bit.
Sammi (my laptop) lacks all my data files -- and standard programs.
So -- what I can do on Sammi is very limited.
H'ever -- much of my mailing project is paperish-clerical.
So -- that's good.
I can make much progress on it -- in spite of Tera being unavailable.
I have had some hardship, discouragement, disappointment, being overwhelmed, intimid8d, etc. by attempting to ascertain more confidently why... or what the most likely major reasons might be for... why I have been developing Octology for over 7 Years, 4 priv8, over 3 public... && I've made so many useful, remarkable, innov8ive, aesthetic, elegant, efficient, etc. discoveries && breakthroughs with my code, d8a, document8ion, && such but still nobody but me recognizes hardly any of it as accomplishment worthy of adoption, recognition, appreC8ion, usage, patronage, support, encouragement, feedback, collabor8ion, recommend8ion, && particip8ion in the ongoing process of improving the total development activity.
Your compliment from last week about appreC8ing my d8 format for being compact && accur8 was the first major comment of positive feedback I've received over the whole past many Years. I don't quite understand why that has been, && remains, the case... but I'd like to eventually discover such things.
I'd be very interested in the possible answers to that situation -- that you are chewing on.
How is the "discovery" going so far ?
Rather poorly. I suspect I have maybe some potentially pretty powerful && possibly somewhat loosely organized adversaries who may variously coordin8 their activities around me to keep me rel8ively isol8d, obscure, under-resourced, corrupting my communic8ions to make me seem more confusing, more unreasonable than I am, unworthy, undeserving of attention, assistance, consider8ion, compassion, respect, regard, etc. && may be trying to cause me to be difficult to remember anything good about, easily forgotten, neglected, outcast, distanced, ... && maybe even stage efforts to kill me sometimes too, which thankfully have probably all so far either failed outright, or just couldn't keep me dead for more than a few Days at a time.
Ok.
Thank you.
Well ...
             Would you like my comment on that which you just shared ?
Please.
Ok.
I'll share it -- but -- I suspect you may thrash me for saying what I am about to.
Maybe not.
We'll see.
Do you want me not to thrash you for it, even if I might have?
No.   Not necessarily.
I always appreciate all of your responses.
All.
I just might preface with this:
Some things which people say to me -- are not what I would have liked to hear.
But all are worth chewing on.
Useful ?
Maybe yes.
Maybe no.
But always worth chewing on.
Ok.
Enough preface.
Let's get into my comment(s) on what you just said.
------------------------
On the "people against you" idea --
I say this.
I believe that people are not "against" you.
I believe they do not "see" Octology's value to themselves.
I didn't write "people" ... although some of what I was meaning was people, but primarily I think maybe evil old God && maybe potent Artificial General (or Super) Intelligences might be at the helm of the efforts against me.
You must grasp that Octology will be appreciated -- and (in turn) you will (also) be appreciated -- as each individual person sees what Octology can do for them.
This is the problem.
You are not the problem.
They don't dislike you.
They (simply) don't understand the value of Octology yet.
And -- at the moment that that turns around -- you (also) will be greatly applauded for it.
I can go on.
I've shown some of the gr8est && best work I've done to all my closest family && friends, then around 150 Perl programmers && still nobody recognizes anything I've done as valuable yet, yeah. I think many being arrayed against me in some fashion or another is likely a part of the reason why people could remain so unresponsive, undiscerning, unable to detect useful patterns I've presented, oblivious, ignorant, bewildered, distracted, dismissive, etc..
But you are typing.
I shall wait for your comments.
Ok.
Good comments.
Thank you.
My response follows.
Thank you for your confidence that eventually both Octology && I will be recognized && applauded. I hope you're correct.
The members of your family -- and the 150 others that you've mentioned -- are not "against" you.
They just do not cherish Octology yet.
And this is now your assignment.
I am a member of the 170 (or so) who do not cherish it yet.
The operative word being:            yet.
How can you know people are not "against" me? It sure seems as though almost everyone is, && remains so despite just about whatever I say or do.
I expect to.
But you have not "made" me cherish it         yet.
This is                 now                your assignment.
Cool. Thank you, Dad. Yeah. I don't know what I must do to enable anyone other than myself learn to cherish any even single minor component of Octology yet. I hope I discover whatever will facilit8 that rel8ively soon.
I am one of the 170.
But -- I am not against you.
Else -- I would not be having this conversation with you right now.
You probably aren't, but it does seem as though almost everyone else I've ever known (&& many I haven't) are increasingly against me.
I have told you (in the past) what is the next step to getting Octology (and its author) recognized and used and greatly appreciated -- and vigorously applauded.
                Have I not ?
I don't remember being told what the next step is. Please tell me now.
I shall.
Thank you for asking.
           You said:
"I don't know what I must do to enable anyone other than myself learn to cherish any even single minor component of Octology yet."
Within that very statement -- lies the answer to "the question".
The key is:         "single minor component".
Octology is a software system (program).
Software systems (programs) have one main intention.
               ‚Ä¢   To serve the user.
Octology has (at least) 485 things within it -- that can serve its user.
Pip is (quietly but absolutely) being requested to explain to the potential users of Octology -- how to use it.
How do software developers do this ?
It's called an "Owner's Manual" -- or sometimes a "User's Manual".
                  This is our (all 170+ of us) assignment (request) to the author of Octology.
(//)
Depends. Usually document8ion, yeah. Also demonstr8ion. I've done lots of both already. Maybe still not enough, or in sufficiently effective && inform8ive ways yet.
         Correct.
Not enough -- possible.
Sufficiently effective -- yes -- that is still lacking.
Informative ways -- yes -- this is what we are w8ing for Pip.
Take0, Take1, && Take2 for the LightningTalk on my PipStuart YouTube channel already shows off over a dozen excellent executions with several help-text inform8ion displays within those brief 5-minute demonstr8ions. I essentially explain that learning Octology will improve almost anyone's vocabulary, math-skills, system-administr8ion abilities, command-line experience, && also coding expertise. Nobody hears, understands, or desires for themselves anything valuable that I've done yet.
           You said:
Nobody hears, understands, or desires for themselves anything valuable that I've done yet.
           This is a true statement.
Not even your own Dad.
Now.
What are you going to do about it ?
"Owner's Manual" or "User's Manual" is rarely something done for GNU/Linux software. Having command-line help (usually by accepting either -h or --help) is commonplace. Also man pages are often used, but I've developed my own altern8ive for most of this called: `sumb` which SUMmarizes my Binaries directory containing all the main Octology executable utility && applic8ion files. I've also written many voluminous dedic8d document8ion help-files in my ~/dox/2du/ directory in the repository. Reading these would give a gr8 deal of background on the components, behaviors, development plans && progress, options && fE8ures, plans for future improvements, etc. but especially 8.utf && know.ls contain the most extensive material describing the system in detail.
Yep.   You have.
I don't yet know what I am going to do about even you, my own Dad, not yet perceiving, understanding, or desiring anything valuable in there.
            And -- it has not worked.
Why not ?
                     Why has what you have done -- not worked ?
I don't know. I can't yet understand how it's even possible that nobody can appreC8 any of it.
I hope I learn.
You will.
Let's take a little side trip.
          Puedo ?
Yeah, okay.
Good.
Here we go.
 
Albert wrote his "Theory of Relativity".
And the vast majority of us -- understand
not one bit of it.
But -- the even more important question is:
how is that "Theory of Relativity" useful
to my life ?
Yeah. Innov8ive discoveries can be hard for almost anyone to grasp.
Ok.
Now.
 
Philip Stuart wrote his "Octology".
 
And the vast majority of us -- understand
not one bit of it.
 
But -- the even more important question is:
how is that "Octology" useful to my life ?
                 And -- this is where you are now Pip.
You need to answer that last question for:
  ‚Ä¢  your Dad
  ‚Ä¢  the 169 others
  ‚Ä¢  the world
Octology will make computer usage faster, simpler, easier to remember, more customizable, && all around much more powerful. Install it. Run it. Read the code && document8ion. Modify parts && discover how str8forward most activities can be. Ask me questions, whenever you have any. I'm eager to answer anything, as well as I'm able to.
Improving your vocabulary, math-skills, administr8ion abilities, command-line experience, && coding capabilities are also still nothing to sneeze at... or shake a stick at... or dismiss && overlook. They should be worthwhile already, but it's like nobody can grasp the significance of any of this.
That is correct.
And your Dad (who happens to be your biggest supporter) is one of those "nobody's.
Why can't you "move" him ?
Because you come from a MicroSoft Windows background, where conventions && expect8ions tend to be quite different. You probably require some book-like printed-on-paper sort of "User's Manual" in order to feel as though you can understand any of the multitude of purposes the system has. People who have any pre-existing familiarity with Free-Software && Open-Source GNU/Linux Oper8ing-System environments are likely not to need any such public8ion... but may have other unmet needs that I'll have to address, since they're more of my target demographic.
                        You have nailed the hit on the head.
           We await your next publication to us.
Can you please respond with some example Table-of-Contents of what you might require or prefer?
Well -- I might.
But -- I am not in your target demographic.
Do you want "the Windows OS people" to use Octology ?
Eventually.
Ok.   Then -- (eventually) make it run on Windows.
Shall we now talk about your (primary) target demographic ?
Sure.
Good.
They are "Linux OS people" -- correct ?
Yep.
Good.
And you say that they "do not need" a (traditional) User's Manual.
And I say:
                  Yet they have not been "moved" into the use of Octology either.
What do they need from you -- into order to "GET MOVED" ?
I don't know.
Good.
               This is a "so true" statement.
Now.    I'm going to try to be "one of them" even though -- I am not.
And here is my "email" to the author of Octology  :::
Dear Pip.
I want to use Octology to increase my vocabulary.
What single (exact) command should I type into Octology to do that ?
`vim ~/dox/2du/8.utf`
Good.   Thank you.
You're welcome.
And because I am not at my computer right now -- when I do that -- what "return" will I get on my screen ?
You'll get your terminal emul8or program to run the `vim` text-editor with the 8.utf document8ion file opened && ready for you to start reading the 8-word list (pressing lowercase "j" or "DownArrow" to scroll-down further in the file).
Thank you.   Now.   I hope this does not offend you -- but how does that screen's response help me to increase my vocabulary ?
By presenting to you Octology's extensive list of 1,391 words that you should study && become familiar with eventually (even if you must look them up in a dictionary in order to).
Good.
Thank you.
Then --
my next question is:
What command can I type that will (directly) give me that list of 1391 words -- without any additional keystrokes, or scrolling, or anything else required of me ?
`8plc l`
Good.
And when I type that -- what does my screen return to me ?
A graph of the Pre-cursorLetters, then all 1,391 8-words arranged in order of the PL's just graphed. You can find details for many of them back in 8.utf also.
Good.
Thank you.
Ok.   Now.   I have stopped being a (sample) Linux user -- and I am now back to just being your Dad.
Okay.
You asked for a sample of the things which should be a part of Octology's User's Manual's Table-of-Contents.
Well this is one of them :::
                     "Increasing your vocabulary with Octology"
(//)
Thank you.
You're welcome Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
I am gr8ful for you.
                   I am gr8ful for you Pip !!
And -- g8er things than I have done -- ye also shall do.
For this is the fervent hope of every father -- for his son.
Maybe *most* fathers.
If this is not the case -- that so-called "father" -- is not being "fatherly".
Could be.
That hope that I just mentioned above -- is part of the "job description" for every father.
I (tend to) want to offer an addendum here -- to this subject which we are in at the moment.  
But it involves a word that Pip does not like.
Should I do it ?
Or not ?
Go ahead please.
Ok.
I shall.
One of the assignments -- to all fathers -- in their "job description" is --
to "bless" their son.
This is a very "churchy" sounding word --
and one (also) which most people (really) cannot define accurately.
          We shall fix that right now.
Most people think of a "blessing" as something that someone "says" to someone else -- which is supposed to be some sort of gift to that other person.
But (sometimes) the gift may (also) be very tangible -- like handing one's son the keys to a '57 Chevy.
However.   I wish not to get (more) into -- what "most people" think of the word "blessing" --
and instead I will go on to the original creation of the word.
"bless" is a contraction of "be" and "less".
One of a father's jobs is -- to bless -- his sons / daughters / offspring / children.
That is -- to be-less -- than they.
Or -- to put it another way -- to hope that they become more than he -- and do greater things than he has done.
And also -- it is his job (along with his wife's job) -- to equip their sons (children) to do that -- -- to be more / do greater than Mom & Pop have been (and done).
And what is "the picture" of "being less" ?
It is of a father lifting a child up onto his shoulders.
This is blessing.
This is being-less than your son / offspring / child.
End of lesson on the true meaning of                 B-LESS.
Thanks.
You're welcome Pip.

Thank you for tonight.
Good one Pip.

Probably. Go ahead.

Hi Dad. Thanks again for the good chat last night. I know you aren't online right now, but I wanted to just send you this chat message to aw8 you for whenever you can find it.
I think I have just 3 main things to request of you, for whenever you might be able to attend to any of them:
0) First, if you seriously require a "User's Manual" for Octology, then I am willing to devote a gr8 deal of time && attention to meeting your need as well as I can but I then require 2 main things to become capable of doing this. I need a MicroSoft Windows 10 (or maybe 8) installer && license key-code whatever. Without this, I remain incapable of verifying any of my code is capable of running in that environment && have no ability to upd8 && upgrade it to be able to do so eventually or effectively. So I need a modern Windows license first. Please help me afford one as soon as you're able. I can't by myself anytime soon.
1) Secondly, I need either or both of a copy of an existing "User's Manual" which best exemplifies exactly what you're looking for in my eventual one for Octology... or just at least some rather thorough sort of templ8 Table-of-Contents outline for somewhat precisely what you're most needing me to describe, explain, demonstr8, give examples for, hand-hold doing, including glossary definitions for, etc. to guide my process in ways that best enable me to address almost everything you're looking to gain from such an eventually publishable printable mailable sort of rigorous document8ion for the majority of my project. Please provide me either or both of these as soon as you're able too.
2) Whenever you get these messages, can you please message or e-mail me back to let me know that we can please chat again around our usual evening time of 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime on whatever night that is, so that we can keep discussing everything we have been l8ly even further (&& hopefully we can arrange to do this before, without w8ing for, next Friday, Dec. 18th to roll around)? I've really enjoyed && benefited from especially our most recent chats, && would like to adjust our plans to enable us to connect even more regularly than just weekly, as only on Friday nights feels inadequ8 right now... but I can w8 until then, should you strongly prefer or require that for whatever reasons. I'm just eager for more regularity.  üòä
Thanks very much! I hope you're enjoying a gr8 Shabbat && Saturday, && that we can chat more tonight or another night soon. Tomorrow (Sunday, Dec. 13th) night probably won't be good for me at our usual time because I have plans to go out to dinner at HuHot with many of my local friends around 7PM on my 44th BirthDay... but I can probably meet up with you online much l8r in the night tomorrow, if you'd like to, probably around 10 or 11PM my-time (2200 or 2300 your-time). Please just let me know what might work next for you. I'm still struggling with being (&& trying to be) loving toward you... && feeling loved by you. It's kind of a fraught-with-peril concept for me l8ly. Hopefully it won't have to remain this way for me, if it's better for it not to be. We'll see. I really appreC8 how much lee-way && leniency && p8ience && understanding && encouragement && generosity etc. you keep granting me with such things. It's just gr8 of you. You're quite an impressive && amazing man && father. I'm very thankful for all you continue to contribute to my life, health, development, hopes, attitudes, aspir8ions, intentions, understanding, beliefs, etc. && I try to keep all this in mind to remain overwhelmingly gr8ful for your respect && contributions to all the meaning in my life. If love is ultim8ly more good than bad conceptually, then I think I probably ‚ù§
you && will continue to. Be well && I look forward to chatting more again soon. Peace!  -Pip
Oops!  s/10 or 11PM my-time/9 or 10PM my-time/;  # still 2200 or 2300 your-time... blast these prevalent off-by-one errors!  üòâ

Greetings Philip.
I found this (what I thought was an email)
when I got on to Sammi -- to prepare your
birthday email of a couple of hours ago.
    But when I attempted to begin my
"reply" to you -- I discovered that it was
not an email -- but (instead) was an
extension of our chattery (what Gmail
calls "Hangouts").
So.   My "wanted-to-say-to-you" is here.
Yes.   I readd it all.   And I believe I understand
everything (for the most part).
And there are a pile of sub-topics in there.
I think I'll shoot at 2 of them now -- and
let the others w8 until we are "nose-to-nose".
Well -- not physically.   But both here
in the chatroom together.  
üòä
You knew what I meant.
     ‚Ä¢   Item #1:
In spite of the fact that there is a HuHot
(also) in Appleton -- I'm guessing that
you (and company) are planning to go
to the one on Witzel Avenue -- just west
of the I-41 -- 3.4 miles SW of your
Mallard Homestead -- yes ?
I believe you said:  "around 7PM".
And that is the one in the Witzel strip-mall
-- not this one -- I think.
And -- I just might suggest that you make
your "around 7" -- earlier rather than
later -- as the Witzel HuHot closes at
8 (pm) on Sundays.
Anyway.   Enjoy your "Birthday Feast" --
and be sure to wear your mask between bites.
                  üòä
      ‚Ä¢   Item #2:
The idea of chatting later today (0'12-13-20)
-- strikes me as a fine to-do.
 
Let's plan on 2300 G / 2200 P.
I'll look for you after ---            
                                And ...
Ah yes.   This is the one I couldn't get
to upload in the "Birthday" email.
         So -- now you have 2 cakes !!
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
(a subject we shall chat more about later today)

                                                                           I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Would you like to chat now ?
                   Or -- would you prefer Monday, December 14, 2020 at 2000 G / 1900 P ?

Hi Dad. Shabbat Shalom.
Sorry we kept missing each other on other nights. Thanks for being willing and trying... and for all the kind BirthDay wishes. I still haven't received a card from you in the regular snail-mail though. Hopefully it wasn't completely lost and will be delivered still somewhat soon.
I'm going to walk downstairs to see if it might have arrived today. Be back shortly...
Back. Got a letter from my Payee, but still no card from you yet. We'll see if / when it arrives.
5'12-18-20 - 2019 Gtime / 1919 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
And how was your ...
Good Evening Dad.
... party at the HuHot ?
Thanks for asking. I had 3 local friends join me there and we all had a very nice time together and enjoyed our meals quite a bit.  üòä
Xcellent.
I'm glad for you.
All.
üòä
Did you receive any other BD cards from relatives or friends ?
Nope. Lots of wishes for happiness online on FaceBook though. It was a quite happy day for me.
Good.
I'm happy for you too.
I don't know much about facebook -- but I have a friend that uses it all the time I think.
Yeah, many people use it on a daily basis. I shy away from it most of the time.
She uses it for her business.
A couple of years ago -- I looked at her postings just to check up on her business -- but have not looked at her stuff recently.
I'm guessing she still uses it -- and I know that her business is going very well.
Good for her.
But that is because she tells me so personally.
She has had me out to her house in Fleetwood for Thanksgiving & Christmas now for about 6 or 7 years running.
Very nice.
Nice!
Yeah.
üòä
But this year -- covid has caused us a hiatus.
We'll get back to it in 2023 or 2024 I guess.
So -- how was your week ?
It was mostly a pretty good week. I had a very nice BirthDay Sunday. I slept much of the early part of the week-days and then have spent much time awake and rel8ively productive since yesterday. I did some coding, some research, some planning, hung out with a couple friends. Things have been pretty good. How about for you? How was your week?
I'm glad for you.
I've thought about you a lot this week.
44 is a good age.
I turned 44 in 1987.
And it was a pretty good year too.
I vacationed in Vancouver in 1986 too.
Yeah. I'm now 11*4 and you're 11*7 Years-Old. I'm 4/7ths of your age for about 8 Months ahead.  üòä
Quite a nice trip.
Yes.   This is the only time that we both get matching digits -- I believe.
Because I was 33 when you first came to see us.
I ‚ù§
 you Philip.
Thanks Dad. I'm still trying to ‚ù§
you too.
Nope.
You are not trying.
You do love me.
I know it -- even if you do not.
But -- it is all ok.
üòä
I'm not sure whether typical "love" is the good thing it's overwhelmingly made out to be. I'm questioning it rather seriously l8ly.
I know.
I'm glad you feel loved by me, assuming it *is* a good thing. Glad you know it, even if I have doubts, since it seems pretty important to you to mention it so often.
You have said that quite a bit lately -- and again during last Saturday evening's chat.
Yeah. I think so many sometimes conflicting concepts are wrapped up in the term that it's pretty difficult to try to intellectually sort out well.
In fact -- I put "A Little Lesson on Love" together -- while you were at your party last Sunday.
Nice. Thanks for doing that. I may have important things to learn.
It's fairly long -- but I will share it whenever you want it.
I think I'm ready for it tonight. Please go ahead.
Ok.
I shall.
Here it comes.

               A LITTLE LESSON ON LOVE
 
I spent a good deal of time on Sunday (12-13-20)
-- in an attempt to get ready for our expected
discussion on Love -- based on your communique
to me at 1145 G / 1045 P on 6'12-12-20.
 
I've thought back over many of our previous times
of discussing it -- and feel that I have been of
little (or possibly no) help to you on this subject.
 
And Sunday -- I thought -- rather than (pointedly)
trying to help you with your continuing "struggle"
on it -- I would (instead) nearly exclusively
concentrate on sharing my own "take" on the term.
 
                            LOVE
 
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
 
It was about 46 years ago -- that I first remember
being asked to do a mini-seminar on LOVE -- for
about 80 or 90 people.  I was told that my audience
would probably consist of mostly adults -- but would
also include (at least a dozen or 2) students who
would be classified as either children or teens.
 
I shall not be sharing essentially a carbon copy
of that one here with you today -- as I have had
more than another 2300 weeks to chew on the matter
since then.
 
Love is a word that is used in so many different
ways -- and it is also (more often than not)
greatly misused and/or misunderstood -- both
of which make for devastating results -- frequently
producing scars which take years to heal -- or
(in some cases) never do.
 
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
 
Today -- I am going to attempt to delve
into only 4 different things about LOVE.
 
     #1 - its common use as a verb
     #2 - what does "love" do
     #3 - ways of giving
     #4 - am I loving / and being loved
 
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
 
And -- before we even get started -- I want to say
that:  I intend to (completely) exclude the use of
the word "love" -- as (and when) it is used in the
realm of any kind of a sexual context.
 
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
 
      #1  What does the word "love" mean
             -- when it is used as a verb ?
 
To begin an answer to that -- I am going to use the
very common expression:  "I love you."  ‚Ä¢  And I am
going to suggest 4 frequent ways that that expression
can (fairly accurately) be translated.
 
       "I love you"   means:
 
(A)   I appreciate you.
(B)   I value you.
(C)   You are someone that I enjoy spending time
        with -- and I hope that that continues.
(D)   I consider it an honor to be counted
        as one of your friends.
Sounds good. I think I'm with you, so far. I really appreC8 how much thought and consider8ion you've put into helping me in this way. Very kind of you.
 You're very welcome Pip.
 
        And -- I might add that -- when I (personally)
        say "I love you" -- to someone -- I nearly
        always mean all 4 of those things.
 
And now -- a few notes on the first 2 (A & B):
 
A and B -- are essentially 2 different ways of saying
the same thing.   But -- rather than only 2 ways --
I suspect I could have (easily) listed at least 5 more
variations -- as some of the other good synonyms for
"value" and "appreciate" would probably be:  ‚Ä¢  admire 
‚Ä¢  treasure  ‚Ä¢  cherish  ‚Ä¢  worship, and  ‚Ä¢  applaud.

Nice! Yeah.
Thank you.
 
    #2   When the word "love" is used as a noun
            -- what does that "love" invariably do ?
I'm a little worried about "worship", but the other good synonyms sound gr8 to me.
Good.   Thank you for questioning that one.
Few people know the original meaning of that word.
And we shall return to that -- a bit later.
Okay.

    #2   When the word "love" is used as a noun
            -- what does that "love" invariably do ?
 
            The answer to that question is not only
            short & simple.   It is also emphatic.
 
                                       LOVE GIVES.
 
            If a person claims to hold within the self
            -- a love -- but that "love" does not give
            -- I say that which resides within -- is not
            a love.   It is something else.   Because:
  
                                       LOVE GIVES.
 
            Period.

    #3   What are some of the ways that love gives ?
 
            Although it is (also) possible to love things
            other than people -- I am (first) going to cite
            examples -- only for expressing one's love to
            people.
Okay.
 
    (a)   Love gives tangible gifts ::: flowers, candy,
            cards, letters, birthday parties, tickets
            to a concert, two weeks in Tahiti, et al.
 
    (b)   Love gives the standard intangible gifts ::: such
            as some kind of service to another person.
  
    (c)   Love gives an intangible (verbal) gift ::: the
            "thank you" is the most frequent variety --
            but (sometimes) outright applause happens too.
 
    (d)   Love gives the most valuable intangible gift :::
            time.  Few things in this world can show your
            love for another person -- more than simply
            spending time with them.

    #4   Am I a loving person ?
            Am I ... being loved ?
   
Some people grapple with "loving" and/or "being loved".
 
They have trouble assessing whether they are a "loving"
person -- and/or whether anyone "loves" them.
 
This second one is often the result of other people in
my life -- not espressing "love" to me -- in the way
(or ways) that I want to be loved.  I have some answers
for this predicament -- and the first one is: to start
loving my self.  ‚Ä¢  When I get that one nailed pretty
tightly -- the "others" in my life -- will soon join in.
 
But let's (also) address the first one:  Am I a loving person ?
 
Start with (c) above.  Do you express gratitude to others ?
Do you say "thank you" to others for even the tiniest of things ?
If "yes" -- then yes -- you are loving those "others" -- and you
must also conclude that you are a loving person.
 
And then ask yourself about (d).  Do you give your time to others ?
And then (b).  Do you provide some kind of service to others ?
 
I have found that every person I have ever met -- is a loving person.
Maybe not every minute of their life.  But at least during some of
the minutes in every one of their days.   No exceptions.   At all.

And -- thus ends the "Little Lesson on Love".
  
Comments and/or questions and/or applause go here.
 
Thank you for list-en-ing (leaning-in).
Applause!
 
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
Thank you for everything you wrote for me there.
Thank you.   Thank you.   Thank you.  
And --
            you're welcome Pip.
I think you *are* helping me find something like my way out of the "loveless forest" I've felt somewhat lost in.
The "loveless forest" !!
A neat term.
üòä
Or swamp or something.
Maybe a toxic-waste dump?  üòâ
Okay... so thinking about your reasonable (and strong-seeming) explan8ions, it seems that I *do* love you, and am pretty clearly loved by you then.
This is somewhat of a revL8ion and a relief to me.
Good.
I think we do mean all 4 of those elements.
I seem to frequently see far more goodness in you -- than you see in yourself.
But -- that's ok.
You are on your perfect path.
As well as the other 4 synonyms, but still "worship" is troubling to me.
And -- you are unfolding.
I can w8.
I love watching you flower.
üòä
Thank you for your p8ience. I hope to keep unfolding, and maybe also helping you too to unfold further yourself.
Thank you Pip.
We never get done doing that.
I don't know what the best ways of performing these things might be yet, but hopefully will discover more and better ways to eventually do so.
          It just goes on forever.
üòä
Good.  üòä
               You *are* the discoverer Pip.
Shall we do "wor-ship" now ?
Other than the "worship" concern, can I please probe a bit deeper first?
Yes.   Certainly.   Please do.
         Go ahead.
Does the givingness of love include any more than those 4 items (appreC8ion, valuing, enjoying time together, and being honored by friendship), that you can also think of... or does that pretty much "cover-the-bases" as far as what love tends to give?
Hmm.
I think I would say that --
those 4 are probably the basics -- but --
you could add (maybe) a few dozen more "specifics" -- which would be quite appropriate.
Did you wish to add some ?
Hmm. Maybe need to think of some for a minute...
            I have time.                (d)
I ‚ù§
 spending time with you Philip.
      Think away.
Maybe love also should give both physical and emotional support rather often?
                 I'll be here.
Yes.   I agree.
Yes.   Both.
In "physical" -- did you mean --
hugs -- or help carrying in the groceries --
or both -- or others too ?
Does love give further through a sincere desire to get to know the other person deeply and significantly?
Both, and others too.
Absolutely !!
Knowing our brothers & sisters -- is one of the needs of humans.
Maslow put it at the very middle of his pyramid.
Idiosyncrasies, warts, and as much of true character and n8ure as can be discerned... probably?
It is called the "belonging" level.
Yes -- the idiosyncrasies & warts are part of each of our packages.
I love them.
What happens when some figure becomes so complex, so unfathomable, so eccentric, so enigmatic, etc. that fewer and fewer people remain even capable of knowing hardly anything about the true self of the other?
An interesting question.
I think I'd like you to expatiate on the "some figure" term -- before I attempt to respond to that one please.
Maybe also, an outcast, a pariah, a black-sheep, an exile, a lone-wolf, etc.?
I'm guessing here that the "outcast" may be how Philip is treated by much of his family -- yes ?
Is it possible for a person's character and n8ure to change so dramatically that essentially nobody can keep up with who they really are (and continue to progress more rapidly toward becoming)?
Yes.
Is it possible for a person's character and n8ure to change so dramatically that essentially nobody can keep up with who they really are (and continue to progress more rapidly toward becoming)?
Let me take a shot at that one.
This may be more than a short answer -- but here goes.
When we "watch" a movie -- we are not only witnessing the doings of the characters on the screen.   ‚Ä¢   We are getting "inside" their beings.   We are feeling what they are feeling.   We are (almost) becoming them.   And --
Each person that we meet in our "real" lives -- is a "movie" to us too.
Do we always like all of the "movies" we see ?
That is -- do we always like all of the personalities that show up in our lives ?
No.
Some make us feel good.
Others make us feel not-so-good.
And ultimately -- all of my life -- is about -- me.
If someone in my "world" -- whether it be a family member -- or someone else entirely -- makes me feel uneasy -- I will tend to shy away from getting to know that person further.
I think the way my mind works makes almost everyone who has ever interacted with me feel uneasy about our encounters.
And (of course) that other person may take my shying away from them -- as if it is something about them -- that is dis-tasteful.
This may (or may not) be the case.
But -- the bottom line is -- people respond to my personality (mostly) based on who (and how) *they* are -- far more than who (and how) I am.
I'm pretty sure that most people find me (and Octology, rather conspicuously too) to be dis-tasteful.
Now.   I shall not attempt to give a "run down" on Mom, and Angie, and Tim, and whomever else -- but I shall just say that -- I believe -- for today -- the people that I happen to know -- who do not wish to spend any time in my "world" right now -- are being exactly how they should be for my personal development to go where it (and I) need to go.
Yeah, that may well be the case. What about when people tend to shy away from my dis-tastefulness (and that of my work) due to both who they are *and* who (and how) I am too?
Those who are not in my life right now -- are giving me a gift.
      (Of course Piece #27 here again)
Hmm. That's an interesting perspective.
             I'll pause here.
You brought up another question that I'd like to respond to.   But -- you are typing -- so I shall w8.
üòä
PoL#27 seems to suggest that maybe I have the mouth of you, my Father... but I speak a lot, while you remain mute throughout most of your life. Maybe it means that my mouth is inherited from (or could somehow sort of belong to) God-the-Father... but I don't know of any such clearly identifiable figure with which to compare speech with, in order to determine how correct such an assertion might be. What is meant by it?
I'm sorry.   Wrong Piece.   Not #27.   I meant to say #29.   Whoops.
üòä
Ah. Gotcha.
     You had said:
Yeah, that may well be the case. What about when people tend to shy away from my dis-tastefulness (and that of my work) due to both who they are *and* who (and how) I am too?
The reason that a person "moves" out of my life -- is always ("bottom-line") to gift unto me -- the space -- and the time -- to let me be (with me) more.
Few people ever "get" this.
Seems like it can be a pretty difficult thing to "get".
When I "lose" a friend (or a family member) from my frequent "coterie" -- there (nearly always) is a pain connected with that loss.
And what does the average person do with that "hole" ?
(that pain)
They try to "fill" it.
Of course.
They do not see the "pains" in life -- as gifts.
Loss is a gift.
In FTR -- we have quite a few lessons on that.
          Loss is a Gift.
Every loss in life -- has one primary purpose.
It is to make space (and time) for me to go-inside-my-self -- and get to know me better.    And then (also) -- make some changes within me.
Losses are gifts.
That is what people don't "get".
     Divorce is a gift.
     Loss of any friend -- is a gift.
     Covid is a gift.
Need I go on ?
     I think not.
          You "get" it -- yes ?
Aren't you guilty of re-defining the word "gift" to be able to apply to losses (including the worst ones for which much more depriv8ion occurs than is gained from the space vac8d by absence)?
You are typing.   Go on please.
There may be shallow up-sides, or "silver-linings", on the backs of severe losses... but it seems inapproprE8 or overly idealistically optimistic to attempt to see absolutely everything as purely "gift" (which strongly implies gaining more than is lost, at least to me so far).
I get you.
My "take" on losses -- is not popular.
Few people "agree" with me.
And -- their lives continue in much pain.
Mine -- does not.
Do they want their pain ?
     They "say" no.
     But -- their "belief package" says:     absolutely !!
Could you simply be desensitized to pain, after enduring too much? Couldn't counting palpable losses as gifts be a survival coping-skill for bearing profound hardship?
My mind (and my set of beliefs) are the producers of all of my pains.
To that last question -- my answer is:
I think not.
I feel pain.
But only for a moment -- or two.
And -- then -- I say "thank you" -- and go digging into the pile of manure -- to find the pony.
Every pain -- has a gift inside of it.
Every loss.
Every disappointment.
Every sadness.
Every frustration.
Every ...
              well -- you get the idea.
That may be true, and I concede that it might be highly valuable to see things through such lenses... but it also seems to be a troubling maybe delusional sort of classific8ion problem.
I can tell you where this comes from.
But -- you may not cotton to some of the terms.
I also don't think all my pains come from within me and my beliefs.
Should I go into it ?
I've had precious valuable computer and video-game equipment stolen from me. These losses are not merely mental, for me.
I understand.
And I stand-under such happenings.
In 1992 -- I lost every single (physical) thing I had accumulated since 49 years before when my "birth" occurred.   I escaped with only "the clothes on my back".
Did it hurt ?
Of course.
Did I see it as a gift ?
Did I feel it as a gift ?
No.
-- until I was willing to.
And today -- I feel better.
üòä
Time, and broadened perspective, can heal many wounds.
Yep.   And -- the "broadened perspective" can be accelerated --
by forcing my self to believe in the "gift" idea.
May I share the origin of the "gift" idea ?
Having my professional computer and video-game equipment stolen from me has inhibited my ability to earn a decent living (even to this Day), contributed to my being homeless for many Months, and drove me to 6 forced mental-hospitaliz8ions over the past 11 Years.
Go ahead.
Ok.
I will.
And -- we can return to that last comment of yours later -- if you wish.
               Here is the origin of the gift idea.
 
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
 
Yeshua said:  "I and the Father are One."
Yes.   He was talking about himself.
But -- He was also feeding us our lines.
Everything He ever said about himself -- He was also trying to teach us to say about our self.
People don't get that.
They think that He was someone unlike their own self.
He was not.
He came here to show us how to be.
     How to live.
     How to think.
     How to speak.
     How to affirm truths about our self.
His "lines" are meant to be our "lines".
When He said "I am the door" --
He did not only mean that about himself.
I am primarily (and best understood as) *not* "One" with you, my Father... and certainly not with any "Father" God either. The st8ment is untrue, even figur8ively (but of course especially literally). I and my Father are 2 individual people. We might be unified sometimes, with something like shared purpose or values and codified ethics, but we're sepR8 beings.
He meant us to say (and believe) that about our self.
He said:  "I and the Father are One.
"
And I (Gerry Stuart) say:  "I and the Father are One."
     This means:  God is not some dude outside of me (Gerry Stuart).
God and me are the same person.
I am God.
And --
God is me.
I am God (the son).
He is God (the father).
But -- in reality -- we are only One.
This is what Yeshua was saying about himself.
And -- what He was trying to teach us to say about our self.
Anyway.
I shall go on with this.
I am God.
God is me.
The (slight) difference (in actual practice) is --
There's almost no evidence of His purported existence. If He were truly here to show us anything, there ought to be unambiguous transmissions of His activities and words-of-wisdom which would have persisted in pristine condition throughout all the intervening Years since His assumed period of ministry and performance of miracles and such. The scarcity of evidence to support even His very existence ought to be plenty compelling reason to doubt the Biblical claims, chronologies, and fabric8d quot8ions (which clearly couldn't recount His actual words, even if they're deceptively printed in Red ink).
that the Father is a "bit" smarter than I am.
You are not God.
And He gives me challenges, losses, disappointments, and various other pains -- which will help me to be Him -- more and more.
Each of these are gifts -- to make the Godness of me -- become more and more and more -- every day.
God is immortal (and supposedly omnipotent, omniscient, omnitemporal, omnipresent, perfect, incapable of lying, etc.), which you are not.
And -- it never stops.
Unless -- I choose not to want to be Him.
(//)
Gifts.
I told you (ahead of time) that you would not like it.
But -- you said to share it.
So -- I did.
Your turn now.
Any god is normally understood to be an immortal being, who is usually capable of exhibiting other super-human abilities (besides just primarily being unable to die permanently).
You are not God.
You are not super-human.
You are not -- in reality -- One with your "Father".
Even assuming He exists and you rel8 to Him in any consistent and reliable way, you yourself just said that He is smarter than you. That means you two are different, and it's an error to consider or call yourself just "One". You're distinct. 2 beings (at least), but probably at least 4 beings (if you consider your f8h in "Father", "Y'shua", and the "Ruach HaKodesh"... and you could easily go even further to indic8 that there are at least 2 distinct gods which primarily are described by the Tanakh [OldTestament] and the Brit HaChadashah, so then 5 beings, 4 gods, 1 man [you]... each very significantly being different in form, n8ure, and abilities from each of the others, so *not* "One")!
There seems to exist no material evidence for even just the mere existence of a single god. To have f8h in a "Father" God, based primarily on your hopes, superstitions, belief in fables and myths, gullibility, and probably hallucin8d linguistic thoughts in your mind and purportedly moving your writing hand to engage in tedious dialog as you pray on paper, your trust is placed in things which can't be seen, observed, tested, confirmed, verified, etc. which is probably all a "fool's-errand".
Everything you just said --
          is true.
You seem to lack any room for doubt, skepticism, critical-thinking, or non-circular fallacious logic.
Every thing.
Faith -- is not sensible.
But I have it -- and it serves me.
I think f8h is a terrible servant. Reasoned beliefs ought to almost always prove superior to beliefs without reasons. Lack of sensibility seems to indic8 at least a very sub-optimal service. I think you've been deceived into believing in beings which either are not real, or are evil and deadly deceivers who hood-wink everyone who's susceptible to their forms of manipul8ion, persuasion, coercion, bribery, terroriz8ion, intimid8ion, disorient8ion, and convincing reassurances that standing steadfast on convictions (leaving no room for critical-thinking skills) will be rewarded eternally (but mainly only after you permanently die to this real life we have here, with certainty... but the f8hful Christians grip certainty only for the misnomer they call "After-Life", as if another real "life" aw8s where there are no more bodies, ignoring the crucial fact that almost all forms of life as understood in reality staunchly require inhabiting a living, breathing, thinking, and moving body). I wish you could question the assumptions that the Bible is true, that your "Father" is God, and that God is anything close to good.
Noted.
Thank you Pip.
How does f8h best serve you? What would be your "gifts" (i.e., losses) if you were to relinquish it?
Good questions.
Do you have answers for me ?
Not at the moment.
Ok.
             I can w8.
Did you get your new glasses yet ?
F8h lets you be comforted by the illogical belief that your high hopes regarding primitive inconsistent myths will become real?
Yes.   That is a pretty good statement.
I did just get an eye-exam on Wednesday and picked out some inexpensive frames for them to install some bi-focal lenses into, which I should probably be able to pick-up within the next 2 Weeks or so. I'm looking forward to them. Thanks for asking.  üòä
I like it.   Thank you.
You're welcome.
I understand vision stuff.
My seeing began to wane in 1994 (age 51).
It has slowly gotten rougher in the past 26 years.
But I still handle it.
It is a gift.
In the beginning of 2020 -- I got a new wrinkle.
From 1994 to 2019 -- the problem was just with reading -- and "close-up" vision.
But -- around February of this year -- I noticed some definite fuzziness in my "far" vision too.
Bummer.
This (quite probably) means that my "driving" days are "over".
It is not of any major "big deal" right now -- as I have not been "behind the wheel" of any vehicle since my "O.N.E." (Orangification of New England) vacation in the October of 2012.
I had hoped to do a "drive" around Michigan with Pip -- in the future.   But -- I don't see that as any major problem.
I can rent the Mustang.   And he can drive it.
Works for me.
üòä
Yeah, I should probably remain capable of driving safely for a good while ahead hopefully.
It is a gift.
I would like for us to realize such a plan, when we can.  üòä
Pip is a gift too.
A gift I gave to my self.
I gave Dot to me.
Dot gave Pip to me.
It's all about me.
Well -- why shouldn't it be.
After all --
                         I am God !!
üòä
I ‚ù§
 my self.
What makes you say you are God, when you only appear to have entirely human-level powers? What sense does that claim make?
Good question Pip.
Thank you for asking.
I shall start this answer --
with a passage.
Philippians 2:7.
This is called the "emptied himself" verse.
Yeshua stopped being The Father -- when he got his skinsuit.
He (then) "lost" all of his "Fatherly" powers.
And He (functionally) become separate from The Father.
And we saw that in  ‚Ä¢  what he did  ‚Ä¢  what he didn't do  ‚Ä¢  what he said  ‚Ä¢  how he acted  ‚Ä¢  what he taught -- et cetera.
Yeshua's "Godness" was majorly gone -- but -- the character of his human time & doings here on the Earth -- were a glowing exemplification of God The Father.
He lived entirely by (a silly) faith -- but -- it worked for him.
And -- it also taught that -- it could work for us --
                   In spite of all of its silliness.
Philippians 2:7 says:
       But made himself of no reputation,
       and took upon him the form of a servant,
       and was made in the likeness of men:
Link is:
https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm
(//)
(verse 8 begins with):
And being found in fashion as a man,
he humbled himself.
When I (Pip's Dad) got my skinsuit -- I "emptied" myself too.
So did Pip.
But he doesn't remember doing that.
Why do you have confidence in your f8h in the truthfulness of the Bible as the only significant account of Y'shua's supposed character through the Gospels' accounts of His human-time && doings here on Earth? If He actually lived and His real doings were a "glowing exemplific8ion of God-the-Father", why wouldn't there be any discoverable evidence beyond the Bible to describe His purportedly gr8 teachings and activities?
So -- he (Pip) is still The Father.
That's what confuses him so.
Xcellent question Pip.
And the answer is:
            There *is* evidence !!
                                I see God in you.
If I "emptied" myself when I was born (like you think you did), why then would I still be the "Father" so confusingly?
I have told you that before.
But you don't see it.
I'm not evidence of the Bible being true.
And that's ok.
I'm not God.
It's only a temporary myopia.
üòä
You supposedly see some super-human being in me.
I'm a man.
Has nothing to do with the Bible.
I see God in you.
And (for me) -- that settles it.
If I ever stop seeing God in you --
    I will begin to question the existence of God.
What are you "seeing" when you supposedly see God in me?
But -- fat chance.
Specifically, what exactly?
You can not stop being who you are.
üòä
What identifies God perceptibly in me?
Do you LOVE me ?
Of course you do.
We just covered that a few hours ago.
Love is who you are.
Else you would not be able to love me.
I love you, but love is not who I am.
You cannot stop being God.
I am a man. I am not God.
You don't know me, if you think I'm God.
Even though you do not believe that you (God) exist.
I see you.
And I know who you are.
You say you "see" God in me. What, precisely, are you "seeing"?
Call me silly.
Call me unreasonable.
Call me anything you like.
But -- I still know God when I see Him.
How do you perceive God?
You (Pip) are He !!
Specifically!
The word "per-ceive" comes from 2 words.
"per" means "complete" or "completely".
"ceive" means "see".
You can claim that all you want, but it just means you don't know me or God, since I am a man, and would never be a God like who is described throughout Biblical accounts. I'm almost nothing like any Biblical God, and never wish to be confused with such a terrible being. Please stop insisting you see the evil God of the Bible in me. You're not seeing me, if that's what you think you're detecting!
I "completely see" God in the body of Philip Alexander Stuart -- based on  ‚Ä¢  what he says  ‚Ä¢  what he does  ‚Ä¢  how he thinks  ‚Ä¢  how he lives.
              Need I go on ?
Yes. What exactly are you "completely seeing"? Details!
What fE8ures can you perceive in me that aren't mine but are identifiable as God instead?
Ok.
You bring up the Bible a lot.
So -- let me start there.
The Bible has a lot of stuff that "seems" to make God out as a terrible dude.
You have a major problem with that.
Did I (also) have a major problem with that ?
Indeed, I do have many major problems with that.
Do most people have a major problem with that ?
Of course they do.
And -- of course I did.
But -- I do no longer.
Curious.
Am I just totally "out to lunch" -- or --
is there some understandable reason why I (no longer) have a problem with that stuff ?
Should I answer my own question ?
No.
I think I'll defer to you Pip.
What say ye -- about me ?
You're comfortable re-defining evil as good and good as evil. God and the Bible are more evil than good, but you unfailingly invert their values. Involuntary genital-mutil8ion of babies is evil. Blood-sacrifice for atonement of sins is evil. Torturing the only innocent child to death in order to pay the debts off for all the guilty others who would believe in the absence of convincing evidence is evil. Genocide is usually evil. Slavery is usually evil. Tormenting unbelievers eternally for a finite life of sins is evil. Flooding the whole Earth would be evil. Confusing all the languages of mankind at BavL would be evil. Calling evil good is evil.
Ok.   Good stuff Pip.
Thank you.
There is a lot in there.
You're welcome.
I'm going to respond to one items at a time.
The Bible seems to be the major problem -- so let's get into that.
And let me ask you this --
    other than the "Yeshua on the cross" item -- which you had mentioned -- what else in the New Testament strikes you as an "evil" doing of God ?
Killing a husband and wife for keeping some of the money they made by selling their land and joining the socialist commune with other disciples.
Good one Pip.
Where is that story ?
Picking an apparently illiter8 Christ and Apostles is another big evil, I think.
Let's do one at a time please.
We'll come back to that.
The "killing a husband and wife" story.-- where is that ?
Forgot the exact reference. Looking for it now...
Acts 5:1 onward.
Yep.   Thank you.
Acts 5:1-11.
Questions follow.
Who killed Ananias ?
Either God killed him or Ananias himself completed suicide. It's somewhat unclear what the original Greek or Aramaic might have meant by the phrasing used.
Correct.
It is not specified.
So -- I say -- we don't know.
And -- who killed Sapphira ?
If God is supposedly in control of anything having to do with the minds of believers (including slightly dishonest ones), inhibiting them from completing suicide ought to be feasible. I think God can be blamed for it, rather regardless of the intent behind the verbiage of the original word meanings.
Alright -- I understand that you wish not to walk down the road that I wanted to travel.
So -- let me ask you this:
Maybe Peter killed them, with a curse from God.
     Who killed your grandmother ?
I didn't witness her death. Maybe suicide, maybe murdered, maybe deceased from senescence old-age, maybe God struck her dead (if there is such a Deity)... so, I don't know.
Reasonable answers.
That may apply to either, or both, of my grandmothers.
Correct.   Yes.   I did not specify which because both answers are the same.
Who will kill your Dad ?
Who will kill Pip ?
Who will kill Angie ?
I don't know, yet.
Tim ?
Mandy ?
Katy ?
We'll see if someone or something kills any of them.
I might be especially difficult to "kill" though, even if it's an evil and deadly God of the Bible that intends to do so.
You shall never die.
If I do, it might be rather temporary. We'll see.
You can't.
You will "appear" to.
But -- you are correct.
It will be "temporary".
And actually -- not at all.
Your skinsuit will become un-animated.
You will be "called" dead.
But -- it will not be so.
Why ?
Because you do not wish it to be.
Everything is about you.
And this is as it should be.
This is as it must be.
You are not evil.
Everything is not about me.
You are good.
I am partially evil. I am mostly good.
And that which is good -- must live forever.
You are not partially evil.
Plenty of good has died throughout history.
That which is good has not lived forever.
You (occasionally) do things which can not (accurately) be called "good".
I am definitely partially evil.
But none of those make you an "un-good" person.
If I am defined by each thing that I do -- then you would be correct.
I do some things that are of varying degrees still valid to call them evil. I may remain mostly good in thought, word, and action... so would not be an "un-good" person, but there's still some serious evil within my past and especially in my future capabilities.
But -- does anyone *want* to be *defined* by their misguided doings ?
I certainly would think not !!
I do.
You do -- what ?
I want to be defined by who I am. Not some idealized white-washed facade.
I *do* want to be defined by my doings (both prudent and misguided alike).
Well -- your Dad says that you "am" a good person -- who (like each of us) occasionally does some not-so-good things.
Are we done with this one (for now) ?
I believe we agree to disagree -- yes ?
Okay.
And -- I am happy with us.
üòä
How is your car doing ?
Not having Y'shua write down his teachings Himself (and all his Apostles to also be liter8 scribes who would each be regularly tasked with documenting their independent eye-witness accounts of events without coordin8ing stories with their peers) would have been evil of both Him and His Father God.
Ah. Car is back in the shop.
Battery and altern8or issues again.
Charging System problem surfaced again yesterday morning, so I dropped it back off at McGovern's around my Bowen corner on Murdock and walked back home.
Correct me if I am wrong please -- but it is my understanding that -- although the battery and the alternator are very close cousins in the electrical system of the automobile -- one going "bad" does not *cause* the other to go bad (also) at the same time.
Yes ?
I think it depends. Sometimes one going bad can damage or destroy the other, maybe usually just in the direction of bad altern8or being capable of causing battery demise too, but not the other way around. Not exactly sure myself yet, though.
I would get a second-opinion on this subject.   I (when I was younger) was very into automotics -- and for a time -- did most of my own work on my early vehicles -- so I believe that I know a bit about this stuff.
And I also know that there are (in this field) -- some "wool" mechanics -- who would take advantage of automobile owners, who are not terribly knowledgeable about the workings of engines and such.
I am not saying that McGovern is one of those -- but still -- it would not hurt to ask some other mechanic somewhere -- if what I said about the 2 items not "going bad" at the same time -- is true or not.
McGovern's is the only shop near enough to my apartment to easily walk back home from (or to, when picking back up) and they are already comfortable billing my Payee for repairs needed, so I don't have the ability to obtain any second-opinions for now.
I'm sorry.   I didn't mean taking your car to another mechanic.   I just meant asking some other mechanic the question about it.
On even just looking it up online.
Ah, yeah. Sure, thanks. Learning more about what's probably wrong for free could be worthwhile, I agree.
You're welcome.
Did you get any snow this week ?
About 2 inches I think. Not much yet.
Hmm.
We got about 8 inches on Wednesday (Dec 16 2020).
And this happened to be the heaviest December snowfall in 54 years.
This table is not Reading.
It is Allentown (about 38 miles to the northeast).
But we usually get about the same weather as they.
Mom and I lived in Allentown in 1972.
I worked at WAEB (790 AM) then.
It was my first radio job after graduating from LACC.
And this was my favorite microphone in those days.
                 The RCA 44BX.
I had an image of it on my business card.
It has my age now in it.  üòä
Yes -- it sure does.
For about 44 or so years -- it was the most popular mike in the industry.
Replaced in 1966 by the Shure SM58.
The 44BX was introduced in 1938.
                                             Shure SM58
I might like BlueYeti brand eventually, since it has my favorite color in it and is 8-letters long, but Shure would probably be a good choice too. I'm hoping to record my first video for my new PedantPip YouTube channel on ChristMas Day. Maybe I can save up to afford better recording equipment by next Spring or so.
More than a million sold in the past 54 years.
It was introduced that year that we had our largest December snowfall -- on that chart that I just showed you.
                                       The FTR company owns an SM58
It sold for $100 in 1966.
I sells for $100 in 2020.
The 44BX sold for $129 in 1938.
     Quite expensive for those times.
The 44 bx is no longer made.
If you find one in working condition -- like on Ebay or somewhere -- you can expect it to go for 8 to 10 thousand or so.
Expensive!
It had a fantastic bass boost in its response -- and we loved it for that.
Yes -- it is.
Actually -- it was fantastically expensive back in '38 too.
If you factor in the inflation thing -- that $129 -- 82 years ago would have been approximately equivalent to about $1800 these days.
Shall we do the "worship" thing ?
Let's!
Ok.

                                             Wor-ship
 
Where did the word come from ?
What does it really mean ?
 
People don't like the word
-- for essentially 2 reasons.
 
    ‚Ä¢   It is too "churchy".
    ‚Ä¢   It (strongly) suggests that
        we don't give God what we
        "should" be giving Him.
 
        It is a "guilt-throwing" word.
 
                 That is unfortunate.
 
And the "guilt" thing is entirely
man-made.   And we shall get into
that later -- or -- some other time.
 
        But now -- let's do
        "the origin" and
        "the really mean"
        of "wor-ship".
 
The word "worship" -- as you had probably
guessed by my hyphening -- was pieced
together -- from 2 separate words.
 
The word "worth" -- and
the word "ship".
 
An excellent synonym for the word "worth"
-- is "value".
 
And -- of course -- the word "ship" --
as a verb -- means -- "to deliver".
 
And there is -- the origin -- and
real meaning of the word "worship".
 
        Worship means -- "to deliver value".
 
Anything given to someone is: "worship" of (or to) them.
 
You say "thank you" to someone.                        You have just worshipped them.
You take them out to eat.                                      You have just worshipped them.
You have a conversation with them.                   You have just worshipped them.
You drive them down to Madison for a game.   You have just worshipped them.
  
It's all worship.
 
If you LOVE them (in any way) -- you are worshipping them.
 
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
(//)
Right on. Thank you.
You're welcome Pip.
What about the connot8ion of singing songs of praise to God forever as "worship"? Isn't that a rather typical interpret8ion and assoC8d meaning of the word usually too?
Yes.   I said we would into that sometime.
And -- I guess now is that appropriate "sometime".
The idea of "worship" -- the way that it is used these days -- is not right.
It is a man-made application of the word -- which God hates.
The "church" and its "leaders" have its (their) own agenda -- on what they would like "their" people (attendees) to believe.
And God cringes at the whole mess.
I could say a bunch of things about all this -- but I shall (here) confine myself to just a few.
FIrst of all -- keep in mind what I just said -- in the definition lesson on "worth-ship".
The word "worship" is used widely in our "churches" -- and shows up here and there -- in Bible translations -- to suggest things which are entirely (way) apart from what God had intended (and still does hope for).
When we find it in the Bible -- our understanding of it is usually muddled by the fact that very few people can even begin to define it.
A far more accurate word to use would be "service".
A good case in point would be Romans 12:1.
As you can see here -- 4 of the more popular translations of today -- use that word "worship".
Only the King James Stuart version uses:  "service".
If you are "serving" someone -- you are "loving" them -- you are "delivering value" to them.
But -- these days -- as you have suggested -- "worship" has come to mean "praising" God -- by singing songs to Him -- that supposedly make Him feel good -- because we are telling Him how wonderful He is.
                                       Balderdash !!
He hates this.   And sees it for what it is.
                   Dung.
He wants us to worship one another.
He wants us to serve one another.
He wants us to love one another.
We miss this -- in spite of the fact that it is all over the Scriptures.
Before I launch into all the ways that we do worth-less stuff "in His Name" -- in our grand stonepiles (that we errantly call "churches") -- I think I better go into an important sub-topic.
              And that is:
                          The Only 2 things that God wants from us.
The idea that we can "give" something to God -- is entirely ridiculous !!
He not only *has* everything.
         He *is* everything.
The Only 2 things that God wants from us -- is:
    ‚Ä¢   To chat with Him
    ‚Ä¢   To be Him
And when all that other stuff happens in our stonepiles --
                  He simply turns His head away -- and goes golfing.
By the way -- a church is not a building -- even though that is the way we hear the word used 99% of the time.
               The "church" is a collection of people
                      that gather together -- to serve (and teach) one another.
Ok.   I've ranted on this stuff for long enough (for now).
Comments / Questions / Applause ?
(//)
Hmm. Thanks, yeah. I guess why do you think so many Christians think of worship as singing God's praises (when that's not at all what He needs or wants)? Like, why doesn't He just tell them that, and set them str8?
Very few people (today) speak for God -- or say things that He would like to say to them.
And very few (also) believe that God is willing to speak to each (or any) of us individually.
Why is that ?
Because most "church leaders" / ministers / priests / rabbis / et cetera -- do not believe that He does.   So -- (nearly) no one goes to Him with questions.
But -- as you probably remember (from just a few minutes ago) -- the First of The Only 2 Things that God  Want From Us -- is -- conversation with Him.
And -- the biggie in that conversation is -- Questions.   God eats questions for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.   He lives on our questions.
Because -- how else are we going to give Him the Second of the Only 2 Things that He Want From Us -- which is "To Be Him" -- unless we ask Him questions about how He is -- and why He does that things that He does -- and why He doesn't do such-and-so.
When we use Piece of Light #2 -- God speaks to us -- through our pen -- unto our paper -- and then we can go and be a conduit to others who are (also) searching for answers to our own life.
I think I've touched upon what you were asking -- yes ?
Yes.
Good.
/Want/  /Wants/
I have covered all 8 things on my PCA for this evening.
And we have gotten into a number of yours.
Do you have other PCA items lingering ?
Cool. Yeah, I guess just 1. Might you please be able to help me to afford a Windows10 license and provide me with a prime example manual so I can start making sure my Octology code can run for you and can begin documenting at the level of detail you're most requiring for comprehension?
Thank you for asking.   The answer for now would have to be no.
But this reminds me that I have a whole email that I had thought that we were going to get into -- but we have not.
Okay. Please let me know if you might be able to another time.
Okay.
May I have about 0:01:44 to go potty ?
Of course.
Ok.   Thank you.   BBSh.

üòä
Well, I think maybe we should be able to wrap our chat up for the night. Shall we please plan to chat again around our usual evening time on Friday of ChristMas Day, the 25th?
            Maybe.
I was thinking that Thursday might be nice.
          But -- up to you.
Friday is fine.
Okay. Let's plan on ChristMas Eve then. Sounds good.
Thursday is fine.
Do you have plans for the 25th ?
I don't have plans for the 25th yet. Do you?
             I do not.
I shall probably spend it with my Father.
And -- it looks like I shall spend Christmas Eve with my Son.
                                  Oui ?
Yep.
Ok.
Well -- thank you for a great chat Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
You're welcome. Thank you too. I ‚ù§
you as well, Dad.
You and Darjee have a good week.
Thank you Pip.
Thanks. You have a good week too.

Hi Dad. Shabbat Shalom.
4'12-24-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
           Merry Christmas Eve Philip.
I have a close friend here, with me. His name is Ken VanClake but he goes by the German transl8ion for his first name: "Wolf(Gang)". He's excited to hopefully meet you tonight and honored.
Merry ChristMas-Eve Dad.
Oh no.
*I* am the one honored.
Wolf: "Thank you!"
                                  Merry Christmas Eve Wolfgang.
Wolf: "I'm dying to meet you. All right. I like new people."
Thank you Pip.
Wolf: "I'm from Florida originally. I've been in Wisconsin for 41 Years."
W: "Just turned 62 last September 5th."
Ah so.
You're welcome, Dad. Thank you too.
I've heard of Florida.
You know the origin of the name of that state ?
We could maybe try to get video with audio working so you could see and hear us? Do you want to try that?
So you are now 58 -- yes ?
Wolf: "Oh my God, no! I hope it's good." (He doesn't know.)
W: "I'm 62. I was born in 1958."
Pip's brother was advented into the air in September also.
The 30th of 1980.
W: "I'm the Earth-Dog on the Chinese calendar."
And the feather for that is ?
The "Earth-Dog".
W: "I don't know the feather. I'd love to know the feather."
He likes to go by "Wolf" or "Animal".
Now "Animal" is his resident helpful spirit.
A "feather" is a "crown".
      It comes from the idea of "a feather in your cap".
A feather sets one apart from those around him (or her).
We each have many feathers.
So -- what is the "Earth-Dog" feather ?
W: "All right! Awesome. How old are you?"
I am ageless.
He doesn't know the "Earth-Dog" feather.
I was never born.
W: "Hahaha. So am I. We're kindred spirits. You're younger than I am then."
Of course -- neither were you.
Dad, can you see or hear us?
I tried to connect with video and audio again.
No -- actually the "ageless" have no age.
Hold on Pip.
BBSh.
Fine.
Take your time.
We're fine w8ing here for whenever you get back.
Wolf wants to get a job as a male-escort, if he can.
Sorry it took me so long to return.
That's okay.
I was attempting (unsuccessfully) to join the
We're fine listening to music and chatting amongst ourselves here.
video chat -- and in the midst of that -- Gmail dumped me in Arizona.
It says:  "Click to join the video call" -- but --
Bummer.
Keep trying to join it.
It    Does    Not    Work    !!
I'll try to disable the video and then re-initE8 it.
Yes -- I 'gree.
But all is perfect.
Wolf: "Pip is a really nice guy. I really like him. I don't have many friends. When someone is nice to me, I'm nice to them back."
Gerry missed a call from you
12/24/20, 7:18 PM
Do you want to shoot the vid-call at me again ?
Doing so now...
Got thrown off of Gmail again.
The vid-call doesn't want to let me in.
That's annoying somewhat, but ah well. We tried.
                Indeed.           We did.
üòä
üòä
So -- we'll just do without it.
Okay. Hopefully we can get it to work again, eventually.
Let me look back over what we have so far -- for any penders.
It'd be nice for you to get a web-cam to send me video back someday too.
Okay.
Wolf: "I'm German, Bohemian, and Romanian. That makes me a 'Ronen'. I don't know how you spell it."
lol
I don't either.
üòä
Pip has Germany in his ancestry too.
Wolf: "That was something my sister told me. She looks all that kind of stuff up."
W: "Her name is: 'Tracey Warwick' (which I also don't yet know how to spell correctly)."
His great-great-great-grandparents (through my mother) were born in Germany.
Is your sister in Wisconsin too ?
W: "Right now her and her husband are going to a place to replenish their marriage, because it's their 26th anniversary. He doesn't treat her well though."
W: "No."
Well Warwick is the last name of a famous singer.
You may remember her.
Gerry missed a call from you
12/24/20, 7:34 PM
She had a bunch of hits in the 60s to the 80s.
Well.   Tell him I want to see him *in my office*.
Pip: "I'm going to run into the kitchen for a couple minutes. I should be back shortly. Wolf doesn't know how to type, but can probably read much of whatever you might want to type to him about yourself and stuff."
This sicheeation needs to get fix-ed.
Back.
Good.
Ok Wolf.
I have a birthday for you of Wednesday, September 5, 1962.
Now.
I need a mailing address too please.
He's 62 Years-old, born in 1958, I think he said.
Whoops.
808A Frederick Street, OshKosh, Wi 54901.
My bad.
Make that Friday, September 5, 1958.
Good.
Thank you.
Pip was set out into the air on a Monday.
1633 eastern standard time.
So -- you're just ¬Ω-mile east of UWO -- and about 1.4 SW of Pip's place.
Yes ?
Wolf: "Yep."
Thank you.
Now.   Tell me about these employment aspirations please.
Wolf: "I want to become a 'Yes-man", but wild."
Oops, used 3 double-quotes && only 1 single. Meant to use pairs matching sepR8ly. Typo.
s/n"/n'/;
Got it.
Wolf doesn't have much experience reading or writing, but he does a decent job of at least reading already anyway.
10-Q.
W: "O-tay! That's cool."
lol
And what is the basic job description for a (wild) yes-man ?
W: "Pamper women!"
W: "This is the first time I've ever met somebody over the Internet. This is cool."
Please feel free to tell Wolf plenty of things about yourself too, which I'm sure he is interested in as well.
Ok.   I'll do 3 items.   And then we'll change the format.
Item #1:
     I have had 43 residences in the past 77 years.
Item #2.
     I've had more jobs (employments) than I can count.   Probably upwards of 100.
Item #3:
W: "I've had multiple dish-washing jobs. I worked 16 Years making vinyl plastics."
     Although I was a radio announce (on and off) for 25 years -- my most beloved job has been teaching -- which I began 34 months before your mother presented you to us.
What kinds of items of vinyl ?
Wolf: "Hundreds of types! I had 2 20-drum machines, 2 15-drum machines, a 10, && a 7 drum-machine."
W: "I'd go from machine to machine, dumping 50-pound bags, 45-on-a-skid, and it took me 15 minutes-a-skid."
Ah ha.
This tells me that you are a strong man.
W: "Yup. I made 120 drums of plastic a-Day, by myself, in 16-hour Days."
Wow !!
And on the weekends -- what was your favorite activity ?
Wolf: "On the weekends, my favorite thing to do was just go home and workout with my w8s."
Hmm.   Makes  ¬¢s  to me.
üòä
Wolf: "Mmm, hmm. What kind of things did you teach (at your favorite job back 34 Months before Pip was born)?"
W: "My 'second-Dad' brought me to Wisconsin. He was a school-teacher, from Elementary to High School."
No -- that was not 34 before Pip -- it was 34 months before September of '58.
Ah.
I was going to ask you about that.
Thank you.
I was wondering why you came to Wisconsin in 1979.
          And now you've answered it.
Thank you.
I've taught quite a few different subjects.
The first (in November of 1955) was mathematics.
Wolf: "Dewey Dwaine Stowe taught vocal music, forensics, media, and speech-therapy."
But then many other subjects in the 65 years since then.
W: "That's interesting."
In the 1980s -- English & Computer Science.
W: "I like older, intelligent people."
And in the late 80s -- I started teaching Personal Development -- and was also a Business Consultant.
I'm not familiar with Dewey Dwaine Stowe.   Where did you meet him.
?
Wolf: "He was a stranger, and he was lost. He asked me directions, and I was just back from Vermont, and I haven't been back to Florida in a few Years, so it changed some and we got lost.
Woops. s/$/"/;
Missed the closing double-quote after that one.
It's ok.
                    All   is   perfect.
üòä
W: "... and we got lost and we got talking, and he took me back to his apartment. He trusted me by going into the bathroom and leaving his stuff on the drawer."
Tell me about Vermont please.
W: "He picked up a stranger. Gave me a test. I passed it. He asked me if I wanted to change my life, and I said 'Yes.' "
          Do  /  see  /  like  ?
W: "Winuski (sp?) Vermont."
And your life changed -- how ?
W: "And I swam in a river, with a waterfall. I got caught in an undertow. I was going to the bottom, and something saved my life."
W: "Then I went back to Florida and met Dewey."
I see.
Thank you.
W: "I was like a gypsy. I didn't have a home."
Was that fun -- or ?
W: "It was a livin' Hell, but I survived it."
Yes -- I can imagine.
And what did you learn from that experience ?
Wolf: "How to survive."
lol
W: "I'm a wild-child."
Well   -   I guess !!
Wolf went to the bathroom.
Is there anything on your PCA for tonight?
There was -- but it doesn't seem too important at the moment.
Okay.
I'm enjoying learning  about Wolf.
üòä
Cool.  üòä
Your PCA Pip ?
Just wanted to inform you that I have received my first new pair of proper glasses in 10 Years of not being able to afford to upd8 my prescription, and I'm now wearing gr8 new bi-focals which enable me to see much better normally and especially now with a down-glance to read even printed books like I couldn't before.
Excellent Pip.
         O
I'm glad for you.
           The "O" was a whoops.
üòä
Thanks, Dad. I'm quite happy to have this gr8 gift of resolvable sight.
Life is so much better when you can read.
Yep.
My eyesight is dwindling quite a bit of late.
Bummer.
Hopefully you can hang on to some clarity.
I can read from the computer monitor -- because most applications have the provision for adjustable font-size.   But -- nearly everything else is quite a chore.
I understand. Things have remained similar for me.
The reading of food packages is nearing impossible these days -- even with glasses plug a mag-glass.
But -- all is perfect.
Just changes.
I don't think all is perfect... but...
And I'm learning how to walk with changes.
I don't see all as changing only ever from perfect to even more perfect. Some things deterior8.
Yes.   My eyesight is deterior8ing.   I get it.
       Thank you.
Heh.
You're welcome... of course.  üòâ
But my mind still works.
And I'm glad for that.
Mind is more important than sight alone.
Agreed.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
                      üòä
Thank you berry much.
Well I think I'm winding down a bit. Maybe we can wrap things up for our chat for the night, and I can take Wolf home, then maybe next Thursday night (New Year's Eve) we can chat again, and if he's over here again at that time, we can all 3 chat again then?
Wolf: "It was gr8 to meet you."
Sorry.   Gmail locked up again.
And to meet you too Wolf.
That's okay. Hopefully won't happen anymore, after you finally switch away from MicroSoft and towards GNU/Linux like Ubuntu.
Thank you so much for the chat.
And thank you too Pip.
W: "I can't w8 to meet you in-person."
You're welcome. Thank you for the chat too Dad.
We'll get to that soon I hope.
Thank you Wolf.
Wolf: "You're welcome."
Is there a chance that we can do tomorrow night at 2000 G / 1900 P.
I have something I'd like your help on.
Yes. Let's shoot for our usual time tomorrow (ChristMas) night then.
But I need some time to put it together.
Okay.
Good.
I'll look for you then.
Thank you to both of you for tonight.
        Much ‚ù§
 I send y'all.
    And ...
Welcome. ‚ù§
sent back your way.
                               Merry Christmas !!
           üòä
Yes. Merry ChristMas!
Wolf: "... and Happy New Year."
Thank you.
      You too.
Good night all.
Good night, Dad.

How was your Christmas ?
What did you do ?
Go anywhere ?
Too many questions ?
It was so-so. I didn't do much or go anywhere. You?
Went no where.
Ate moderately.
Did not do the intended prep for this chat.
Got very lonnngly involved in something from last evening's chat.
Cool.
About you having German blood.
Took me about 6 hours to write it down.
Consumed most of my day.
But -- if you find it of a little interest -- I'll be happy for it.
But then -- if not -- that's ok too.
I find it of interest.
My research "learned" me quite a bit anyway.
lol
         How do your know ?
You ain't heard it yet !!
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
      You're fun.
I heard that I probably have German blood... although my blood barely speaks much German, if any.  üòâ
Thanks. I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
I know verry little German (language) too.
Thank you for your ‚ù§
 Pip.
My grandfather spoke a little "Pennsylvania Dutch" occasionally.
It is quite similar to German.
So -- I learned 3 or 4 simple expressions.
And -- that's about all.
Some is usually better than none.
I've heard that.
In fact --
     from you !!
            And -- I believe it.
You have a PCA for this evening ?
Nah.
Ok.
Oh, I got your BirthDay card finally! Thank you for that.  üòä
Wow !!
         I mailed it on Tue the 8th -- if I remember correctly.
W8.   Let me check that.
Okay.
Yes -- John's on Tue Dec 1 2000.
And yours -- on Tue Dec 8 2020.
You received it when ?
YesterDay.
Thu Dec 24.
Only 16 days.
      I'm a happy camper.
üòä
üòä
It is not right.
The Post Office says 3 days -- 19602 to 54901.
So -- it is not right of them.
Yeah.
However -- I am glad that they *did* deliver it.
Me too.
Loss would be of major concern.
Late is only disconcerting.
I can live with that.
Glad you got it anyway.
So am I.
You readd it -- yes ?
Yes.
Good.
That brings up another thing that I had on my lingering PCA.
In a recent chat with you -- you mentioned that were 4/7 on my age.
Yeah.
And I remarked that this was the only time we would share the "twin digits" thing.
Well -- I was mulling over that later -- and realized that I was quite incorrect.
Now is the 4th time that we have.
That's several.
And -- we may get (at least) one more too.
Will we get 2 more ?
Hmm.
Maybe.
When you are 66 -- I will be 99.
So -- maybe.
        But -- possibly not.
üòä
That would probably be pretty cool for us both to see 66 and 99 together.
Ya never know.
We might make it.
But (looking back over this) -- at 77 -- I make typos a lot.
That's okay. It's pretty normal actually.  üòâ
I said:
     -- you mentioned that were 4/7 on my age.
2 typos.
Should have been:
     -- you mentioned that you were 4/7 of my age.
I knew it.
Of course you did.
But I would prefer more excellence on my part.
I agree that more excellence is usually good to prefer.
Actually -- although we tend to call these "typos" -- technically -- they are not.
They are actually due to lack of "mental diligence" -- and often caused by "hurry".
     I have no excuse for that.
I am guilty of hurry often.
     It is not a goood thing.
I don't consider hurrying to warrant guilt.
lol
We may "see" the word guilt differently.
I do not link "guilt" with "punishment".
Probably do.
Mine can potentially go either way.
You may see the 2nd sentence in Piece of Light #20 -- for how I hold the concept of "guilt".
Got it.
Good.
Sorry I disappeared again.
Thank you, Gmail, for dumping me.
My Father does not believe in punishment.
          And neither do I.
I do. I think it has a place.
GOP.
Sometimes punishment seems approprE8.
             Because ?
Various reasons. No special ones jump out at me yet... but I guess when punishing does more help than harm.
I'd like to hear more on this -- whenever you're ready.
Doesn't have to be tonight.
Sometimes punishment helps correct misbehavior.
Whenever is fine.
Ah so.
An example please ?
I don't have a concrete one yet.
You've never been in jail -- right ?
Twice.
Oh.
Not sure I knew that.
Thank you.
Length each time ?
Yeah. Driving on a Suspended License and DisOrderly Conduct.
2.5 Days and around 6 Days, I think.
Ah so.
And on the License issue -- have you ever done that "unlawful" driving again since ?
No.
Ok.   And do you believe that the 2.5 days in jail was the "corrective" factor for you ?
Not exactly.
GOP.
Not the best example.
Wait.   I don't understand that response.
I'm tired and can't think very well for now.
Ok.
That's valid.
Shall we postpone this subject until some other time ?
Let's.
Ok.
Done.
Are you nearing "ready for bed" ?
Somewhat, yeah.
Well -- I have a bunch more PCA items -- but none of them are hot.
Okay.
May I do a brief one ?
Yes.
Thank you.
Here 'tis.
Near the end of our chat last evening
-- you had said that you were going
to take Wolf home.
  
I'm guessing that that means you have
gotten it back from McGovern.  Is that
a "yes" -- and if so -- is everything
functioning properly now ?
Yes. Seems fixed, for now.
Car -- that is.
Good.
Were there replacements -- or only adjustments ?
New battery. Same altern8or, for now.
Xcellent Pip.
And you "Payee" took care of the expenditure ?
Yep.
Or should soon.
     Good.
So -- you be a happy camper ?
Yeah.
Right on.
üòä
üòä
Well -- the "Pip is 6% German" PCA -- will probably take about 27 minutes to deliver to you (once I start it).
So -- we don't want to do that tonight -- correct ?
Yeah.
Okeedoke.
I'm fine with that.
Can we plan to reconvene on "Late Christmas Day" (Saturday, December 26 2000) ?
Okay.
Good.
Thank you Pip.
Well -- thank you for tonight.
I ‚ù§

You're welcome. Thank you too.

Good Evening.
I have to go to the bathroom. Feel free to type whatever you want and I will read it all when I get back shortly.

               I'm thinking.
Hmm.              I would have to say good.
                   Mixed.
I got 2 items on my lingering personal agenda done.
     So -- I'm happy about that.
Cool.

Good Evening Philip.
I've read your e-mail and have been researching things in order to hopefully help you get Tera in good shape for you again.
I have found some relevant inform8ion, but might benefit from searching further.
We should be able to discuss what I've found so far, though.
Ok.
Thank you Pip.
P.S. Wolf is over here hanging out with me again tonight. Maybe you guys can try to chat again somewhat l8r, once we discuss Tera stuff sufficiently, if you both want to. I can be glad to type his spoken messages for you.
You're welcome.
Ok.
Hello Wolf.
Happy to "see" you again.
Wolf: "Hello. Happy to 'see' you again too. Happy New Year... well it will be."
Wolf: "I locked myself out of my apartment, shoveling snow."
He can't get a hold of his LandLord to get the maintenance guy to bring his spare-key to let him back into his place. Their number goes str8 to voice-mail with a full mail-box. Crappy!
That doesn't sound like much fun.
Yeah. Hopefully he can get let back into his apartment somehow sometime soon.
Snow ?
           It snows in Wisconsin ?
Yep. We got probably about 6-inches of snow last night.
Wolf: "I shoveled about 500-feet of drive-way and side-walk today."
Maybe you should move into a Mallard apartment.
Pip's landlord lives in the building.
Maybe.
Ah yes.
6-inches is a small bunch.
My LandLord is terrible at responding to contact though.
Some landlord are that way.
I can't remember any bad ones though.
I guess I have been fortunate.
I believe I shall w8 to wish you a 'appy New Year -- until you have a place to go to start it properly.
/to/  /to -- to/
Wolf: "Ah haha. I don't drink alcohol. Every Year, I celebr8 not drinking."
Nice idea Wolf.   Me too.
Wolf: "Good."
üòä
Okay. Let's try to discuss Tera for a while. Then you guys can try to get to know each other better afterward.
Okeedoke.
GOP
From what I've been able to discern from your e-mail this afternoon, it seems that the 2 main issues you've wanted my help with were: 1) failing 92mm fan && 2) failing RAID1.
Yepper.   Correct.
With what I've looked up so far, it seems that you should *not* need to purchase a new BTX Power-Supply in order to power another new 92mm fan.
Good.   Thank you.   I suspected such.
A new power-supply could make it easy to connect particular types of fans directly to it instead of to fan-pin-outs on your MotherBoard, but it should not be necessary to go that route.
Ok.
Good.
I haven't yet loc8d the specific fan-pin-out support of your HP Pavilion Elite HPE-490t in a specific8ions sheet yet. I need to look further to find that.
I'm not sure that that is too important -- really.
It sounds like it's an "HP Truckee UL8E Desktop MotherBoard called PegaTron 594415-001".
Thank you.   Good information.
I've found a couple images of either the same MotherBoard you have, or a very similar one. It looks like it has at least 2 3-pin fan connectors towards the upper-left corner beside the CPU socket. There might also be another down between the RAM slots and your top PCI-Express slot.
Is that one 92mm ?
You should be able to purchase high-quality 92mm fans from NewEgg.Com for about $9 each, which have various characteristics about air-flow versus noise during oper8ion. They should have standard 3-pin connectors which should interface uniformly with Tera's MotherBoard.
Good.
üòä
With what you wrote, it sounds like you've had one fan over your CPU, had one 92mm case-fan for intake at the bottom of your chassis, and a 3rd fan probably largely for exhaust blowing out from your power-supply. Is my impression correct?
That is correct Pip.
It should also be pretty feasible to obtain basic adapters to connect rel8ively standard 92mm case-fans directly to power-cables coming out from your power-supply... but this would probably be less-than-ideal since the MotherBoard would then not be able to know the rot8ion speed, voltage driving it, etc. which it could use to throttle the speed to adjust and adapt helpfully to higher comput8ion loads and consequently higher heat gener8ion requiring comparable cooling for dissip8ion.
So, I'm pretty sure you should not require any new BTX Power-Supply just to drive a new 92mm case-fan. It would probably be best to get whatever fans can connect directly to your existing MotherBoard, so that it can monitor and manage them.
Good.
Thank you.
I believe (for the past 10 years) the case-fan was powered by a cable from the MotherBoard.
Now regarding the RAID1 issue, I have to preface things by making clear that I have almost zero zilch nil experience with anything having to do with MicroSoft or any Windows Oper8ing-System since 2009.
You're welcome.
Ok.   I understand that preface.
Yeah. It probably still should be able to have a new fan installed which could still be powered by a cable to your MotherBoard.
Good.   So -- on Issue #1 -- I'm leaning toward finding a new repairman.
Go on with the RAID1 issue please.
Good. It seems as though Windows 7 Pro should still be able to run RAID for some time to come... but since that version of Oper8ing-System was "End-of-Life" termin8d back in January, it ought to be of significant concern that any version of 7 will no longer be receiving security or other upd8s.
You probably shouldn't require upgrading to Window 10 in order to still support RAID1, but it's probably the best idea for you to get the upgrade anyway, if you can afford to anytime soon.
Yep.   I understand about the security or other pudates.
I know that it is "the best idea" -- yes.
s/Window 10/Windows 10/;
Thank you Pip.
You're welcome. Even just 8.1 would probably be much better to switch to from 7, since at least it is likely to continue to receive ongoing support for a while to come.
The thing that I (currently) am not comfortable with -- is that my repairman is telling me something that is not true.
8.1 is junk -- and everybody knows it.
Sammi has 8.1 -- and I (like everybody else in the world) hate it.
Yeah. That should be cause for concern. He may be trying to milk you for more expensive parts and labor which are quite possibly unnecessary.
When I "up" from Windows 7 -- it will definitely be to Windows 10.
Did you indic8 that another of your SeaG8 Barracuda 7200.11 drives has failed? This being the 3rd one to do so in over 10 Years of oper8ion?
I shall do some major research on Windows 10 -- to prepare me for upgrading to that.
But first -- I want Tera back in operation.
Do you know if the drive that failed this time was the remaining 1.5TB drive or the newer 2TB one?
Yeah. Hopefully you can get Tera back in oper8ion affordably and soon.
It is true that this is my 3rd harddrive failure in 10 years.
I have no way of knowing whether the 1.5 or the 2.0 has failed.
Hmm. Your RAID setup should be able to tell you.
I'm guessing that Dave chose to give me a 2.0 in March of 2016 -- because the 2.0 was only $74.
My first harddrive failure was in June of 2013 -- and the 1.5 (then) was $90.
3 drive failures in 10 Years seems like a lot. I may have experienced my own problems over a decade ago with a SeaG8 1.5TB drive, but have had very few issues with any of the many 2TB drives I've gotten since then.
Seagate has been known as a quality drive manufacturer for decades !!
I remember them from back in the early 1980s -- when I was a computer salesman myself.
You said:
"Your RAID setup should be able to tell you."
But -- since Tera is not (currently) working -- I cannot know that yet.
It sounds to me that what I really need -- is to get Tera "back from the shop" -- as is.
The failed 92mm case-fan is disabling Tera from booting up at all?
And look for a new repairperson.
Yes.   You are correct.   A new fan should let her boot.
It does seem that you would probably do well to find a better repair-man, yeah.
You should be able to pretty easily order a $9 Arctic 92mm case-fan from NewEgg.Com and install it yourself with just a pretty normal Phillips-head screw-driver.
Thank you.   I believe that will be #2 on my Tera to-do list.
I forget. Does "Phillips-head" have 2 "L's" in the spelling, or just one? Do you remember?
2 Ls is correct.
You're welcome. Thanks for the reminder.
Phillips is a standard last name.
Philip is the standard first name.
1st = 2.
The following link should be a very solid choice:  HTTPS://NewEgg.Com/arctic-cooling-afaco-09000-gba01-case-fan/p/N82E16835186077?Item=9SIA1K63T90775&Description=92mm%20fan&cm_re=92mm_fan-_-35-186-077-_-Product
wrong          scratch that.
1st = 1.
2nd = 2.
Yes.      Now I've got it right.
      That's the way to remember it.
üòä
Thank you for the link.
You're welcome. I hope you can get Tera repaired professionally, well, and affordably soon.
I shall address the fan thing (Tera Agenda Item #2) -- as soon as I take care of #2 -- which is to get Tera back in my own hands.
I hope to do that tomorrow (Thu Dec 31 2020).
Cool. I hope you can.
I said that one wrong too.      It should have been:
Actually installing a new hard-drive is normally a pretty str8-forward process too. You should become capable of doing both yourself, without risking inadvertently damaging anything.
I shall address the fan thing (Tera Agenda Item #2) -- as soon as I take care of ***#1*** -- which is to get Tera back in my own hands.
I understood.
Yes -- for you -- I'm sure it is simple.
But then -- the new drive must be repopulated.
And I have no clue on how to go about that.
I've already been Tera-less for 40 days.
I am not in a hurry about this.
I want it all done right -- not fast.
#1 is to get Tera back home.
It would be good if you learned how to manage more of your equipment maintenance and upgrades yourself.
Tomorrow is the hope for that.
And then I shall bend your ear for more advice -- if I may.
In addition to minimizing the likelihood that anyone will be able to "pull-the-wool-over-your-eyes" by selling you unneeded parts and labor, you can just be more self-reliant and have less down-time if you gain capabilities to handle your own rel8ively minor recurring issues.
Yes, you may.
I will try to be available again tomorrow evening around our usual time.
Great.                   Thank you Pip.
             You have been *very* helpful this evening.
You're welcome. Glad I could hopefully be of some assistance.
Thank you.             Thank you.             Thank you.            
Please feel free to let me know any other ways I might be able to be of more assistance to you.
Drive to Pennsylvania by tomorrow morning ?
                     =)
              üòä
No -- I'll rent a Cessna Citation -- and come get you.
Heh. Sounds good.  üòä
Let me check that out.
      BBSh.
Not bad.
Only about $12,000 to come for you.
Of course x2 to bring you back.
And then after you fix Tera -- I must take you home again.
So x4 -- altogether.
Equals only $48,000 -- for the transportations portion of having you fix Tera.
But then -- there is parts -- and what is your hourly labor rate ?
Free for you.
You'll never get that Fujitsu LifeBook laptop / tablet that you talked about in your email to me (earlier today) -- giving away your expertise for free !!
I paid Dave.
I paid Pat.
I'm probably going to have to pay Jerry (for his time).
I should certainly want to pay you.
Yeah, but you can't afford hardly anything and are in need of assistance, so I can help you for free, even if I'd charge others for such services.
Besides -- after $48,000 for the Citation rental -- your charge will hardly be noticeable !!
Ok.   Well -- we can negoti8 that further -- after I land for you at OSH.
-- better known as "Wittman Field".
Okay. Please let me know when you can fly in. If my car is still running, I can probably pick you up at Wittman Field, if I know when you can land. Is there anything else on your PCA tonight?
Dozens of things.
Anything on yours ?
Nothing particular on mine for now.
Is Wolf still there ?
He is. Yes.
Good.
I had been thinking about something that he said last Thursday (Dec 24) evening.
He said:
     "I'd go from machine to machine,
dumping 50-pound bags, 45-on-a-skid,
and it took me 15 minutes-a-skid."
And -- I started to do some calculating.
Wolf: "Yep, and I dumped 1000-a-Day, in a 16-hour Day."
  
       4¬Ω tons per hour       (9,000 pounds)
Wolf: "Yes."
     36  tons per shift        (72,000 pounds)
   180  tons per week     (360,000 pounds)
9000  tons per year  (18,000,000 pounds) 
Wolf: "Sometimes I would work 18-hour Days, and I would never get any respect for it."
 
And that "shift" is only 8 hours.
I believe you said that you were
working 16-hour shifts.
 
And that does not account for your
additional weight-lifting on the weekends.
 
I'm guessing that makes biceps of about 23 and a half inches -- yes ?
Wolf: "I haven't measured them, but they're not small.  üòä
"
Wolf: "I have a 53-inch chest."
Wow.
My biceps are 12.5 -- which is right in the ballpark for my age.
Arnold Schwarzenegger had 22 inches at his peak.
I'm guessing that is approximately what you look like.
Arnold's chest measurement was only 57 inches.
Wolf: "I never pumped it like Arnold."
Wolf: "No steroids."
Well maybe not -- but a zillion 50-pound sacks per week --  still builds a little muscle.
Good for you Wolf.
üòä
Wolf: "For 16 Years str8, I weighed 196.  üòä
"
Impressive !!
Very nice.
We were also talking about German ancestry 6 evenings ago.
Want to hear about Pip & Germany ?
Wolf: "Oh, sure, sure. I'm always interested."
Good.
Here comes.
 
      Pip is 6% (+??) German.
 
Pip's great-great-great-grandparents (through my mother) were born in Germany.
I say 6%+ because Pip has 8 sets of g-g-g-grandparents on my side of the
family.  8 sets means 16 different ancestors who each have a 3% contribution
to Pip's gene-pool.  The 2 that I know of that were from Germany -- make that
6% figure.  However -- I don't know about the "where-from" on the other 14.
 
‚Ä¢  So that 6% could be lower than (actually) the full story.
 
‚Ä¢  My mother's parents were Esterly & Focht -- which suggests that Pip could
   be 25% of German origin -- and that's just on my side of the pool.
 
‚Ä¢  Of course -- Pip has another 16 g-g-g-grandparents on Dot's side of his
   gene-pool contributors.  So -- 6% is merely an "at least" percentage.
 
‚Ä¢  Pip is also 25% Jewish -- through me.    My father's surname is Solomon.
 
‚Ä¢  Pip is also 25% Greek  -- through Dot.  Her father's surname is Mathoudakis
                                               -- which was "Englishized" to become Mathews.
Or "Shlomo".
 
‚Ä¢  Pip may also be (up to) 25% Welsh or English
                                                      -- as Dot's mother's maiden name was Power.
Sholmo ?
Wolf: "My grandpa was a side-kick of Hitler. One of his henchmen. He fell in love with a Bohemian / Romanian woman, brought her to the United St8s. Last name was Schnurstein."
           whoops
Shlomo ?
Schnurstein ?
Your father's surname in Hebrew would've probably been "Shlomo".
       What does that name mean ?
Wolf: "String-stone."
Neat.          String-stone.
Shlomo is the Hebrew for the English "Solomon" ?
Wolf: "My grandmother, they were gypsies. They were Czecholslovakian which became Bohemian."
Yes. English "Solomon" is usually "Shlomo" in Hebrew.
Thank you Pip.
You're welcome.
Wolf: "And I don't know nothin' about my father's side."
That happens.
Wolf: "I just know he was a boxer in the Army and a mechanic on half-tracks and tanks. He was in Patton's infantry."
Well -- you know a little.   That nice.
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 
‚Ä¢  So -- the question arises:  Why does Pip have the name "Philip Alexander Stuart" ?
Wolf: "My dad sparred with Joe Lewis."
 Joe had pretty big arms too.
3 names of many kings of history were given to me, along with gr8 initials of philosophers: Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates.
Alexander the Gr8 was super conquering son of King Philip. Stuarts also had kingdoms and dynasties.
Well ok.
Wolf: "My dad would military press a '53 Buick with tires on it and everything."
Now that's heavy !!
Wolf: "But he was an alcoholic, and he went downhill from there."
Yep.   alky will do that.
Here is the rest of the story on Pip's name:
 
Why does Pip have the name "Philip Alexander Stuart" ?
 
   (b)  Well -- the "Alexander" is not because he first appeared during the 100th
          Anniversary of the 1876 invention of the telephone -- by Alexander Graham
          Bell.  No -- that came from Dot's father:  Alexander Rhodes Mathoudakis.
 
          ‚Ä¢  And "Rhodes" is the 4th largest of the more than 6,000 Greek islands
          and islets scattered in the Aegean and Ionian Seas -- of which only 227
          are inhabited.  ‚Ä¢  Did his ancestors come from there ?  I don't know.
          Possibly Dottie knows.  ‚Ä¢  Rhodes covers 541 square miles -- just
          slightly less than half the (1212 sq.mi.) area of the U.S. State
          of Rhode Island.
 
          ‚Ä¢  2 of those 227 Greek islands have become (semi) famous in recent
          years.  In both cases -- it was because of a hit movie being filmed
          there.  In 2005 -- some of "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"
          (starring Alexis Bledel) was shot on the Greek island of Santorini. 
 
          ‚Ä¢   And then the biggie -- in 2008 -- was "Mamma Mia" (starring
          Meryl Streep) -- nearly all of which was captured on Skopelos
          -- with one of the more spectacular locations shown here.
 
Where (exactly) is this on the 12 by 6-mile Island of Skopelos ?
Right where I have placed the red marker -- on this map of it
-- in the skinny (less than 2 miles wide) northwestern portion.
 
And -- to give you a better idea of how Greece (the land of Pip's
maternal grandfather) lays out in southeastern Europe -- here is
a 1350 by 650-mile view -- where you can also see that the Island
of Skopelos is about 75 miles north of Athens -- and Crete (the
largest of all of the Grecian Islands) is 160 miles to the south
of that capital city.  ‚Ä¢  The Island of Rhodes (which we had
mentioned earlier) is just 90 miles to the northeast of Crete
-- which is 6 times the size of Rhodes.
 
          ‚Ä¢  Both of these "movie" islands are pretty tiny.  ‚Ä¢  Santorini
          is only about 29 square miles.  ‚Ä¢  Skopelos is only slightly
          larger -- at 37 square miles.  ‚Ä¢  For comparison sake -- the
          city of San Francisco is just under a 7 by 7-mile square on
          the tip of its northern California peninsula -- totaling
          47 square miles (uh, the tip -- not the whole peninsula).
 
   (a)  The "Philip" is easy.  'Tis the name that Dot & Gerry
          picked from the Bible's 8th chapter of Acts.
Wolf: "Oh. That's very interesting. I'm very interested in that."
 
   (c)  But the very curious one is the Scottish surname of "Stuart".
 
                3 questions:  (1)  Where did that come from from ?  
                                        (2)  Is Pip partially Scottish ? 
                                        (3)  What does "stuart" mean ?
Wolf: "I haven't a clue."
 
           The answers:  (1)  Pip's Dad's step-father.
                                     (2)  Not at all (that we know of)
                                            -- but maybe.  See note below.
                                     (3)  "stuart" means servant.
 
      Note:  The names "Stewart" and "Stuart" are both of Scottish origin. 
      Although today -- you will find (approximately) 80% with the "ew"
      spelling -- and only about 20%  with the "royal" spelling -- both
      mean the same thing.  ‚Ä¢  We call "Stuart" the "royal" spelling
      because King James -- who (in 1604) commissioned 47 scholars to
      produce the 1611 version of the English Bible -- was a "Stuart".       
Wolf: "My mom named me 'Kenneth', and I didn't find out it meant 'WolfGang' until much l8r."
 
End of essay.
(//)
Wolf: "Wow. That was very interesting. I love that kind of stuff."
So -- your full name (at birth) was ?
Wolf: "Kenneth (WolfGang) Reed VanClake."
Neat name.
üòä
Are we winding down for this evening ?
        it's been quiet for about 7 minutes.
Yep, looks like it.
Well -- thank you to both of you for tonight's chat.
Very nice.
I ‚ù§
 you both.
You're welcome.
Pip:   I'll look for you tom at 2000 G / 1900 P.
Wolf: "You're welcome back and I can't w8 to meet you in-person."
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
Wolf:   Get that spare key my man.
Yep, look for you again tomorrow night. Hope you have a good rest of your night tonight and a nice Day tomorrow.
Thank you Wolf.
I'll be there soon -- in my rented Citation.

Hi Dad. Happy New Year's Eve!  üòä
 
Good New Year's Eve Philip.
üòä
And how are you this evening Pip ?
Wolf is hanging out with me again tonight too, just to let you know.
Good.
I am doing pretty well this evening. Thanks for asking. How are you?
Did he ever get back into his apartment ?
I am perfect.
Thanks for asking.
Yes. His landlord let him back in today. He is no longer locked-out. Thanks for asking.
You're welcome.
          That's nice.
You're happy about that Wolf -- yes ?
Wolf: "Yeah, very much happy... but it's not cold to me. I could've stayed out all night in shorts and a tank-top."
192 pounds of insulation ?
Wolf: "Nope. I have 235 pounds."
Oh.   Ok.   I stand corrected.
       How tall are you ?
Wolf: "I'm 5-foot 11 and 1/2 inches."
Ok.   Good proportion.
Wolf: "I wear size 12-triple-E shoes."
That's pretty large !!
What are we going to talk about this evening gentlemen ?
Wolf: "Oh... anything you wish.  üòä
"
How about --
Yeah, I agree. Is anything on your PCA for tonight Dad?
      anything *you* wish ?
I have scads of items on my PCA -- but only 1 of any importance.
          Why don't one of you go first ?
I don't think either of us here have any good ideas at the moment about what to go first about.
(//)
Ok then.
I'll go first.
I had a very productive day.
I got a lot done here at home -- including doing my wash.
And then I ran out to take care of 4 errands.
Got 3 accomplished.
Wolf: "Nice. I do my wash twice-a-week. I don't have many clothes and am looking forward to another stimulus-check so I can afford more. I'm poor."
On the 4th one -- my Father said we would have to w8 until Monday the 4th.
Are you employed Wolf ?
Wolf: "No. I am disabled. Hand-surgeries, arm-surgeries, and back-surgery."
I see.
Well -- money is over-rated.
          We shall not have any in Heaven.
How could that be known ahead of time? How can Heaven even be shown to be at all likely to exist meaningfully somehow?
2 very good questions.
What do you think ?
Wolf: "I've got my health and I'm happy yet."
That's all that's important -- right ?
I don't think there's any compelling evidence that any place commonly referred to as "Heaven" exists... and even if it did, nobody could know much about it while still living real lives, here on the real Earth.
There are tons of people who are neither healthy nor happy.
Actually -- Heaven is not a place.
People tend to refer to it -- as if it is -- but it is not so.
Wolf: "I give all my glory to my 'Higher-Power'."
Xcellent idea Wolf.
If Heaven is not a place, I am pretty sure whatever might occur there, it should scarcely be called "life" at all. "After-Life" is unlikely.
The original (and fundamental) definition of "life" -- is "productivity".
And likewise -- the original (and fundamental) definition of "death" -- is "un-productivity".
I don't think so.
Ok.   What you do you think ?
You shoveled a lot of snow yesterday.
That is life.
Snow removal is productive.
"Productivity" might have rel8d somewhat closely to various "original" definitions, but throughout the majority of my Years alive, "life" means surviving and basically just not remaining dead yet.
Ok.
Thank you.
Aspects of life might be properly assoC8d with forms of productivity, but I don't think the latter is a sufficient definition of the former.
And why do you say that ?
Hmm. Because life most typically describes an anim8d st8 of being. Having a pulse. Breathing. Able to ambul8 about, probably quite like a typical bipedal animal who's probably pretty pedestrian. Productivity is not necessarily so tightly assoC8d with most of what life is and means.
I agree that what you have just described -- is the way that the word "life" is most commonly used.
But this is only *a* way of seeing it.
When Yeshua talked about "eternal life" -- what was He suggesting ?
I don't think anyone can have good ideas about what Y'shua actually talked about, or just was "suggesting" for that matter either.
Ok.   I'll accept that.
        Good answer.
                    Thank you.
You're welcome.
üòä
I strongly doubt any book called a "Bible" has some special monopoly on truth, historicity, or wisdom. It seems largely bereft of all 3 as-far-as-I-can-tell.
I agree with your idea of any single book having a monopoly on such things too.
Wisdom can come from many sources.
Wolf: "I was baptized at least 31 times... or more."
Wow.   Why so many ?
Wolf: "Every st8 I lived in all over the country, I got in with the religious people and everyone had to baptize me."
I understand that.
It is a widespread doing in religious circles.
Each religion wants to suggest that all the other religions "don't believe right".
When people ask me what religion I belong to --
     I tell them --
          "The same one as My Father."
Wolf: "My father died when I was a child, but I still remember the way he treated people, with kindness and respect, and I follow in his ways."
That's pretty good idea Wolf.
Wolf: "That's just the way I grew up. I made myself who I am."
Xcellent.
What are the gr8est reasons you can provide for having confidence that there won't be any money in Heaven? Why do so many people think they have something like certainty already about the key tr8s of whatever "After-Life" they've been assured of?
I see 2 questions.
Let's tackle the 2nd one first.
My answer to that question is -- I don't know.   You would have to ask each one of those "many" -- to even begin to get any kind of a "blanket" answer.
I can give you my own answer -- if you'd like -- but that would only be for one person.
Isn't it concerning how convinced many become and remain, about things which are effectively unknowable. Certainty about things which lack evidence or reason seems quite troublesome to me.
Please go ahead with your answer though, if you could care to.
s/unknowable./unknowable?/;
I don't think my own is important.   I believe that each single person needs to find a "way" or a "holding" -- which makes sense to the self.   ‚Ä¢   And -- if they are comfortable with that -- and it works for them -- what anyone else thinks -- is not of any great weight.
Wolf: "The more I learn about you, Gerry, the more I'd like to meet you in-person."
Wolf: "You're a very interesting person."
Thank you Wolf.
     I look forward to our face-to-face.
If most people can appease themselves by calling senselessness somehow "making sense to the self", I think especially in aggreg8, such ways actually are of a gr8ly terrible w8... a burden on rational realists.
Wolf: "You're welcome."
I see 18¬Ω minutes of silence.
Yep.
Is this a trend developing ?
Wolf: "Oh. I was w8ing for him to say something."
Him whom ?
Pip ?
Wolf: "I'm interested in what you have to say."
Wolf's "him" meant you, but he spoke it to me, as his typist.
I neglected to transl8 it properly.
Ah so.
Is there another subject coming ?
Maybe both Wolf and I would be interested in the material in some of your best Fix-the-Radio scripts. Would you care to share any of those with us please?
I was telling him how you and I had discussed me potentially being your FtR narr8or for a while, but I felt I had to back out.
Yes.
Wolf: "If you (Gerry) could help me learn to read well enough, I would be game to be your narr8or."
That is what happened.
You and Pip have basically the same philosophy about life and spiritual matters -- yes ?
Should we try to see if we can connect a video-call again now, so you might be able to see and hear us, if it works this time?
Up to you.
The text is of most interest to me.
Wolf: "To get to where I can speak in front of other people, I have to let them know who I am, and about the trials and tribul8ions through my life."
Wolf: "But it would be interesting to get an idea of other people's thinking, instead of just talking about myself."
Wolf: "I have a feeling Pip and I have a very close perspective on many things, yes."
I'm pretty sure that Wolf and I have much overlap, but also probably quite a large number of distinctions between us as well, when it comes to philosophy about life and spiritual matters.
Gerry missed a call from you
12/31/20, 8:51 PM
An FTR narrator needs to "deliver" the material in each Script -- as if he (himself) believes it.   There are 2 ways that this can be done efficaciously.   One is -- if he *does* believe what is being said.   The other is -- in the case of many of the professional narrators in the industry -- he (the narrator) acts "as if" he believes everything in the Script -- regardless of his personal feelings about what it says.
Wolf has been told that he could probably make a good motiv8ional speaker someday. He'd probably like to learn about any of your best FtR scripts, when you have time. I am interested in them too.
Wolf: "Yes. If it's written down, I will make it as believable as I can make it."
Rarely to we simply select a Script to share with our students.   In nearly every case -- a Lesson is shared -- in response to a question from an individual student.   The words "script" and "lesson" -- are essentially synonymous.
So -- as Pip (pretty well) knows -- from past history -- if you want a Lesson (Script) -- you get it as a response to a question that you have asked.
Wolf: "Excellent."
Shall I show him your 29 Pieces-of-Light for 10 minutes or so?
/to we/  /do we/
10 is good.
11 is even better.
8 may even be sufficient.
But -- I believe that he really can get quite a bit of knowledge about The Pieces from you Pip.
However -- I would be happy to respond to any of his questions too.
Wolf: "I like what you've written down there, all the 29 Pieces-of-Light."
Thank you Wolf.
Wolf: "I don't have any questions about any of your 29 PoL yet. That pray-on-paper is interesting to me. Gypsies and Wiccans similarly write on paper, then burn it."
I've heard of that.
Wolf: "Very good."
Piece #2 is a bit different -- in practice.
Wolf: "That's very good (29 PoL). I was very interested in some of that, even though some of it is a little far-fetched."  (this after going over more of your PoL details and some of my rebuttals, critiques, and queries)
Good.
I just played for Wolf FTR-000c.wav so he could hear the James Allen speech which was essentially the only script you and I had begun working with to try to get high-quality audio recordings. He said it sounded like "pure poetry".  üòä
I agree.
W: "Awesome."
Mr. Allen was good at explaining things which generally fall into the "FTR" category.
You also like Napoleon Hill very much too, correct?
This is correct.
Allen & Hill were both (definitely) teachers in the area of Personal Development.
However -- Allen tended toward shorter essays -- and 8 to 10-minute lessons -- which is usually what our FTR lessons run.
Napoleon Hill -- made his mark -- by spending about 26 years in the preparatory research for his book:  "Think and Grow Rich" -- which was finally published in 1937.
What other authors and speakers about Personal Development do you also regard highly for FtR lessons to become based upon?
That's a good question -- thank you.
It's difficult to answer it though -- as you have worded it.
Let me see if I can "get at" what you seem to be asking -- but also clarify the part I am having trouble with.
Okay.
FTR Scripts/Lessons are rarely (if ever) based on something shared by one of the authors or speaker on Personal Development.
Ah. Well scratch the "based upon" part, and just mention figures who've most influenced FtR then please?
Customarily -- our lessons are culled from the whole gamut of my Personal Development study -- which has run over the course of (at least) 55 or 60 years.
If we were to go through the 600 or so lessons (which are now written down) -- and one-by-one -- try to say "who" this or that idea came from -- it would usually be totally impossible.  
The number of P.D. speakers/teachers that have contributed to my current amalgamation of knowledge on P.D. -- is probably un-countable.
However -- I shall (here) mention just a small handful of my favorites.
Napoleon Hill        1883-1970  age:87
Earl Nightingale    1921-1989  age:68
Zig Ziglar                1926-2012  age:86
Brian Tracy             1944            age:76
Wayne Dyer            1940-2015  age:75
Jim Cathcart          1946             age:74
Bob Proctor            1934             age:86
Socrates                 470-399BC  age:71
Plato                        427-347BC  age:80
Aristotle                  384-322BC  age:62
Of course -- I have left out dozens (and scores) of other great ones -- but that will give you a good start on some of my faves.

Thank you Pip.
      My neighbors are duly setting of tons of fireworks!

I knew that you knew.
And you knew that I knew that you knew too.

Happy 2021 Pip & Wolf.
Thanks so much Dad!  üòä
You're welcome.
I ‚ù§
 you.
Are we about done now ?
It has been quiet for nearly an hour.
I think we can be done for tonight. I ‚ù§
you too. Wolf says: "Happy New Year! May God bless."
Thank you Wolf.
And thank you to both of you for a nice chat.
When would you like to get together again Pip ?
Let's plan on our usual time again this evening (now that it's Friday, Jan. 1st)?
You're welcome. It has been a very nice chat from both of our ends here too. Wolf said "Chatting more again with you would be an honor."
I believe that is a can do.
An honor ?
      Ah.   But you forget.   The honor is mine, Wolf.
He and I have been deb8ing the possible existence of souls, spirits, ghosts, divinity, life, death, different dimensions, etc. pretty heartily for hours now. Good time.  üòä
               Neat.
Any conclusions ?
Wolf: "Live life and prosper."
Sounds goood to me.
üòä
I'm inclined to conclude (for now) that souls do not live, or even exist tangibly.
I am inclined (leaning) to disagree with that --
           -- but then --
our disagreement on such matters is no new thing !!
üòä
Well     now     w8.
You said:      "tangibly".
I'm "in" for that.
     A "soul" is *not* a tangible "thing".
With that -- I *do* agree.
Yeah. Intangible "things" probably aren't really cohesive coherent entities.
Define "soul" for me please.
The ancient superstition that presumes to know that living beings possess something like an essence or consciousness which does not die along with the body. There seems to be no known way to detect any such apparition as persisting or being transferable to newer bodies to inhabit l8r.
Hmm.
Wolf: "When the egg is entered by a sperm, then the seed is the soul."
This would suggest (then) that a "soul" is tangible.
Do you believe that to be so ?
Wolf: "Yes."
Hmm.
What say ye to this Pip ?
Do you like Wolf's idea ?
I say: "No. I don't think there's enough compelling evidence to suggest that anything like a soul exists."
Well -- I believe it does.
But -- unlike Wolf -- I do not believe it is tangible.
A body, a brain, a mind, a consciousness... these exist, tangibly, palpably, measurably, detectably, discernably, considerably, etc..
On these 4 -- I believe that all 4 exist.   ‚Ä¢   But only the first 2 tangibly -- the last 2 intangibly.
If a soul isn't tangible, must it follow that it is utterly impotent then?
I heartily disagree.
     Love is intangible.
          But far from impotent !!
I think there are measurable characteristics and tr8s of human physiology which can (to varying degrees) indic8 the presence of (and activities done by) minds and consciousnesses.
If love gives, then it's tangible.
lol
We have gone through this so often -- and I doubt whether we shall come to any agreement on it in the next 150 years -- but --
I love the discussion.
It is fun.
üòä
Thank you.
Agreed.  üòä
Thank you too.
If you can (at some point) present good reasons to think a soul does exist and can engage with reality somehow, please feel free to provide them.
Wolf: "This is the first time I've had any such discussions with anyone. It has been very enlightening to me.  üòä
"
Good Wolf.
I think I'm going to drive Wolf home now, but will hopefully be able to chat with you more again around 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime.  ‚ù§
          Someone just said:
If you can (at some point) present good reasons to think a soul does exist and can engage with reality somehow, please feel free to provide them.
I'll take that challenge.
Cool.
     I'm feeling free to do so.
Nice.
I shall offer the following 3 paragraphs.
 
I have never heard -- or seen in print
-- including in any dictionary -- a good
rendering of what a "soul" truly is.
 
I *do* have a definition of it -- but
it has not come from an else.
 
I have not actually written down the
definition of the word "soul" -- but
I believe that it can be garnered by
sifting through Axioms 15 and 16 --
neither of which define the word
"soul" -- but both mention it.

Thanks Dad. Chat more l8r.  üòä

Hi Dad. Sorry Wolf and I are about 10-minutes l8 tonight.
5'01-01-21 - 2011 Gtime / 1911 Ptime
How was your first Day of this New Year?
Happy Tail of New Year's Day Philip & Wolf.
Restful.
And yours ?
      And yours ?
I do not accept your "sorry" --
     for being "late".
Mine was pretty good. I got some really gr8 new custom color profile code working && checked into my Octology project on GitHub. I'm quite pleased with my new capabilities from what I've been able to get working decently well so far.
          You were right-on-time.
Perfect.
Wolf: "My Day was very eventful. I didn't get no sleep last night. I stayed up watching CNN and the celebr8ions."
     "Late" is only an "idea" -- not an actuality.
Ah. Okay. Well I still prefer to try to be punctual, whenever possible.
Oh.   So.   A TV junkie -- huh ?
Wolf: "Oh. Not a TV junkie all the time. I just watched it for the celebr8ion last night. I'm gonna hit it early tonight... and get some sleep."
Good job Pip.
Nice.
Sleep is a goood idea.
     I (too) get some from time-to-time.
üòä
Wolf: "I'm going to walk home now. Getting pretty tired. Good night Gerry."
Good night Wolf.
     Thanks for the visit.
          Take my ‚ù§
 with you.
üòä
üòä
He will probably be over here again another time soon. We have good discussions together, which we both enjoy. He's also rather excited about the possibility of becoming able to afford a basic laptop when his next Stimulus-Check arrives and trying to get himself online at his apartment, so that he might learn how to use a computer and the Internet sufficiently well enough to eventually try narr8ing FtR scripts with you. He has my full-throated support, should you two become able to collabor8 on such things. He likes most of your 29 Pieces-of-Light. I haven't shared much of FarFar's 27 Axioms with him yet though. I only have 13 of them still. I'll bet some of those will reson8 with him too though.
Hmm.
Some computer literacy would be a good thing to acquire -- I think.
I applaud the notion.
I agree. It will probably open up all sorts of beneficial new horizons for him to be online from his home.
Yep.
About a 37-minute walk to Wolf's crib ?
Probably about that. He likes to walk in the cold. He's comfortable and used to it.
That's good.
Looks like about 1.85 miles by roads (or sidewalks).
                          Around 1.3 crowfly.
I   see   we   have   a   lot   to   talk   about   this   evening.
                 üòä
Hmm.
Heh. Not much from me for now.
That's ok.
     I like watching you breathe.
          I used to do that when you just 12 days old.
s/you/you were/;
Well -- actually before and after that too.
Cool.
Yes "you were" -- thank you for the correction.
Why did I pick "12 days" in that statement ?
Do you know ?
I don't think so.
Because Dr. McTamanny gave you to us as a Christmas present.
On Saturday, December 25th of 1976 -- he gave us the "ok" to take you home.
Because you were about 5 weeks premature -- and very tiny -- and not yet ready to be away from your doctor -- he kept you in the hospital for 12 days.
Ah. Yeah.
See.   I knew you would remember it -- when I reminded you.
You were quite young at the time.
üòä
                  You probably don't clearly remember too much from those first few weeks.   I understand Pip.
But Mom & I do.
I don't.
              Very vividly.
                          We were enthralled by you !!
Our little miracle.
             With emphasis on the "little".
5 / 4 at birth.
4 / 8 shortly after.
We were not all sure that you would "make it".
But we all hoped.
And (apparently) you also gave the "yes" to it.
Thank you Philip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
You're welcome. I ‚ù§
you too.
üòä
Thank you Pip.
And what was my Christmas present in 1975 ?
     Do you remember that one ?
Not at the moment.
Mom gave it to me.
It was the first chariot you ever got to ride in.
On Christmas Day -- 1976.
     The yellow 1968 MGB.
Here is the Google graphic for today
-- just in case you missed it.
Thanks.
You're welcome Pip.

Ok.
Thank you for tonight Pip.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
You're welcome Pip.
Can we plan on Mon Jan 4 2021 ?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.

If you're there, "Hi Dad. Wolf is over again and we're just watching some videos on YouTube and starting to record our own (probably destined to be uploaded soon to my PedantPip channel). Hope you're well. I know we didn't plan to chat again until Monday, January 4th at our usual evening time, but since it was 7PM here now, I thought I'd at least check to see if you might be on and interested in chatting tonight as well.  ‚ù§

Good TueEvening Philip
And how be ya this fine day ?
Okay. Tired again, but at least awake for now.  üòâ
Me too.
But -- I got your email.
     So -- I thought I'd better show up.
          Didn't want to get called on your carpet !!
üòä
Should we just re-schedule for tomorrow night?
Would you like to ?
Either way. Was there something important you wanted to get to?
sniff   sniff
You are the most important Pip.
     I got to chat with you for 3¬Ω minutes.
          Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

Good Evening Philip.
The snooze was good ?
Yes. Yours?
It was.
Thank you for asking.
And today was productive ?
Scarcely. Mostly slept today too.
Ok.
Why so much ?
I don't know.
Hmm.
And you'd like to talk about tonight ?
Nothing in particular on my agenda for tonight.
Ok.
Are you still tired ?
Slightly.
Hmm.
All 4 -- or just a tricycle ?
lol
üòä
Dad made a "cutsy" !!
I guess -- what I was really asking was --
     do you wish to return to the sack ?
I could, unless you have something to discuss instead?
I have about 9 things to discuss -- and 23 questions to ask.
     But all 32 of them will keep.
          None be HOT.
Okay.
Shall I tuck you in for tonight -- and plan a lennngthy chat for another thyme ?
Sure.
Ok.
   Well.
      I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
         Thank you for that.

Hi Dad.
It looks like Wolf and I will need to run up to Appleton after my medic8ion observ8ion in about an hour... so we'll probably be back a little l8 for scheduled chatting with you. Hopefully be back before 8PM Ptime.

In the mean-time, maybe you could check out the video we recorded last Saturday which I just uploaded today at:  HTTPS://YouTu.be/uPhWp7DOXio  ... and let us know what you think of it, when we're back online l8r tonight.
Wolf says: "Hi."
L18LJWlf
Hi Dad. We're back.
Sorry we're a bit l8r than originally planned. Did you get to watch our video? Any thoughts?
We should be ready to chat whenever you are. We'll probably just be watching other YouTube videos until you're available.
5'01-08-21 - 2113 Gtime / 2013 Ptime
Shabbat Shalom Philip.
Hello there, Dad.  üòä
     and Wolf.
And how were your last 2 days ?
Pretty good. I got some new profile color theme code added to Octology, directing what else I should try to do further soon ahead. I also started the PedantPip channel today, and am happy about that. How were your last 2 Days?
Good thank you.
My last 5 days have all been 85+% about the same (one) thing.
Wolf: "I've been doing good. I've gone for some nice at least 10-mile walks."
So -- I've been busy.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome. What is the one thing you've kept busy with?
10-miles walks are good.
     Not sure I've ever done one of those.
Did a few 6 or 7 -- but can't remember a 10.
Wolf: "I just walk and concentr8. Think about what I want to do."
Good Wolf.
And --
          what *do* you want to do ?
Wolf: "I want to heighten myself, like I want to come to California and live a different life."
He and I have considered attempting to move to Los Angeles and be roomm8s out there, maybe next Summer, or within the next couple Years, if it takes that long.
Ah so.
Tell me about this "different life" that you are contemplating please.
Wolf will probably remain on prob8ion for another 2 Years. I'm eager to get myself and Darjee and all my stuff moved back to Southern California by August. Probably try to get there and search for an apartment or at least decent room to rent in July, and hopefully sign a lease then move August, before my lease here in Captain's Cove ends just before September.
Wolf: "When I came to Wisconsin, I learned a different lifestyle. Now coming to California, I can just have a new page in my book of life."
Have you been to Calie (ever) ?
Wolf: "Yes. When I used to hitch-hike around the country, I was in Cali a few times. I don't know the names of the towns. Venice Beach was one of them. "
I've heard of Venice Beach.
Been there.
I'd strongly prefer moving back to Venice or North Hollywood this Summer. Maybe Costa Mesa or Pasadena as backup possibilities.
Have relatives who lived many years in the town of Venice.
Possibly you've heard of them.
Or -- even seen them on television.
Someone said:
I'd strongly prefer moving back to Venice or North Hollywood this Summer. Maybe Costa Mesa or Pasadena as backup possibilities.
Who said that ?
Wolf: "It has been so long, I don't remember names of people."
Pip said that.
I try to put Wolf's sayings in double-quotes after design8ing him as speaking, named with a colon before the quotes.
Got it.
Thank you.
Wolf -- you used the term "heighten myself".
     Expatiate on that for me please.
Wolf: "I want to expand myself. I want to learn new things."
Good.
Great idea Wolf.
But -- you can do that anywhere -- yes ?
Wolf: "Yeah, I'm still a young 62. I'll be 64 when I move to California."
Ok.
Thank you.
Pip -- I know that you have been to Venice
-- and lived in North Hollywood.  What is
the attraction in Costa Mesa & Pasadena ?
I have lived in V, NH, && CM. Beppu-san has lived in P several times, so maybe we could become roomm8s there beneficially.
You, John, and Wolf.
Has Wolf met John ?
Wolf has not met John Beppu-san yet, but they might next month if Beppu-san can visit (exactly a Month from today) as has been tent8ively planned.
Yep.
Feb 8.
I remember.
Good idea.
Hopefully. If a vaccine comes out within the next Month, I'd hope you could please try to visit then too, Dad.
I'd sure like you, Beppu-san, Wolf, and I to share company and convers8ion and a few healthy meals together... if not between Feb. 8th and 16th, then some week between the 8th and 16th of any l8r Month when we can.
Thank you Pip.
üòä
You're welcome.  üòä
May I make a correction ?
Puedo ?
Yes.
This is not your fault.
In the thousands of movies that I've seen in my lifetime -- I don't think that more than 10 or 15 of them get this right.
It's about personal pronouns.
/you, Beppu-san, Wolf, and I/
/you, Beppu-san, Wolf, and me/
Do you understand why the "me" is the correct pronoun in that sentence ?
Not exactly. You've mentioned it to me before, but for whatever reasons, it sounds wrong to me, my thinking, and speech using "another person and I ...".
Yep -- I understand.
Let's see if I can clear it all up for you.
The sample sentence is:
"I'd sure like you, Beppu-san, Wolf, and I to share
company and convers8ion and a few healthy meals together."
Wolf: "I would like that very much too. I can't w8 to come there and meet him."
The *group* of people is:
"you, Beppu-san, Wolf, and I".
And in that sentence -- that *group* is "objective" -- not "subjective.
".
That means:
If you were to substitute a single pronoun -- in place of the *group* -- the sentence would be:
"I'd sure like *us* to share
company and convers8ion and a few healthy meals together."
"us" is objective.
The (collective) subjective pronoun would be "we".
And you would not say:
"I'd sure like *we* to share
company and convers8ion and a few healthy meals together."
"we" -- just like "I" is subjective.
"I'd sure like if *we* were to share company..."?  üòâ
Maybe someday I'll become able to recognize the distinction you're making. I don't seem to have much intuition about objective versus subjective yet.
Ok.
Wolf: "I would sure like to see and read your 27 Axioms. I was interested in the 29 Pieces-of-Light, the last bunch you had. If you have anything else?"
Here's the story on the Pieces and Axioms, Wolf.
I share them with others -- the same way that they were shared with me.
Wolf: "Good."
The 29 Pieces are shared as a group -- all at once.
W: "I can't w8 to hear 'em."
They are a package.    They "go together".
The 27 Axioms are shared one-at-a-time.
When you "need" one -- you get one.
When you don't need one -- your mind does not need to be cluttered up with ideas that you don't need.
Sometimes I am asked:  "Why don't I need the others ?"
     And the answer usually is:
          You are already living the others.
So did you watch our first new PedantPip with WiseWolf video yet?
Absolutely.
And -- I have about 2 hours of comments --
Cool.
     just for starters.
I think we have time.  üòä
But -- before we go there -- I'd like to continue on a "lingerer" from tonight's chat session.
Puedo ?
Yes.
Thank you.
 
A "Summer 2021" move to the "warm-farmland"
state -- sounds like a good target.
 
How have your plans to "begin generating a
personal income in January" been coming along ?
Poorly so far. Hopefully my prospects will improve soon. At least I'm making some iter8ive progress on Octology and starting to get some YouTube video content online (both of which I hope to keep doing more of). Supplementary income will probably depend on landing a Perl-Programming position somewhere eventually. I'll likely search more concertedly on Monday and Tuesday ahead.
For the Perl position ?
Yes.
Good.
     I shall aw8 that report with b8d breath.
üòä
 
Have you received a "simulous" check
from Uncle Sam recently ?
Not yet.
Well -- when you do -- that may be a bit of a helper to the move to Pasadena.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Maybe. Thanks. I ‚ù§
you too.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
I might spend the majority of the amount on my car registr8ion ($85 due by Jan. 30th) and an inexpensive laptop which can dual-boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu GNU/Linux decently. These might help me to eventually earn additional income to hopefully move back to Venice in August.
Good.
Maybe I'll be able to save a good portion of it for funding my eventual move though. We'll see.
Is Venice your first choice now ?
Wolf and I would probably do well to get identical laptops so that I can teach him everything he'd like to learn and I can ensure that as much of my Octology code can work effectively on both of our machines.
Yes. Venice has remained my 1st choice throughout most of my life.
Sounds like a goood idea 2 me.
Why's that ?
Some of the best times in my life were spent in or around Venice. I remain more fond of it than anywhere else on Earth I can imagine living.
I see.
Those sound like great reasons.
I've never lived in any of those shore communities.
But I've had a number of friends down there.
I guess one of the reasons I've shied away from a residence there is -- they have a number of rather coolish evenings.
I'm fond of Corona Del Mar and Laguna Beach also.
Most of my "LA area" residences have been in the SFV.
Warm days.
Warm nights.
I love it.
I lived somewhat close to waters in San Rafael, San Bruno, Rodeo, and Milpitas (all in Northern California).
I worked in Laguna Hills for a time.
But I commuted from the Valley then.
Yep.   You liked Northern Calie ?
I did, but not quite as much, as I still prefer Southern Cali to Northern under almost any circumstances.
I understand.
I love the LA area.
I've lived in 4 areas of Calie.
LA / Bakersfield / Monterey --
     and my (absolute fave):  San Luis Obispo.
My first Calie home was East Hollywood -- which was your Mom's first home with me.
That area is now known as "Koreatown".
Nice.
Good memories.
üòä
Yeah, nice!  üòä
Wolf: "I can't w8 to make new memories myself."
Yes -- memories have a lot to do with our fondness for a locale.
You will Wolf.
     The best is yet to come !!
I love "Little Tokyo" or "Japan-Town", but yeah Korea-Town and China-Town are cool spots for me to frequent too, when possible.
That area is quite a bit changed in the past 50-some years.
Yeah. So what comments do you have about our "What is Love?" video, and have you watched it more than once?
I lived in 3 different places in that "Wilshire & Western" area of LA.
Cool. I'd like to get myself back there this Year!
One of them was just a block away from the Ambassador Hotel -- where Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 -- while I was living there.
The Ambassador had since been torn down.
/had/  /has/
Wolf: "I was in California when the Hotel-California was still standing."
W: "When I was about 10 Years-old, my friends took me to WoodStock."
Is there a (real) "Hotel California" ?
There was.
I didn't know that.
I thought the Eagles just "made that up".
Wolf: "Nope. Real hotel."
W: "It was a Devil's-Cult hotel."
Ah ha.
What does that mean ?
"Devil's-Cult" ?
W: "Devil worshippers lived there, and they practiced Devil-worshipping."
Ah so.
Well -- I'm ok with never visiting there then.
Yes -- you turned 11 years old about 2¬Ω weeks after Woodstock Weekend.
Pip's Mom & I had our first date on Woodstock Weekend.
Wolf: "Yep. My hippie friends took me there in a hippie bus, from Florida to New York."
     But that was in Beverly Hills.
     Not southern New York State.
What was your favorite act (or acts) ?
Wolf: "Janice Joplin singing 'Me and Bobby McGee' and 'Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz'."
Yep.   Me too.
I didn't get to Max Yasgur's Farm -- but I very enjoyed the movie.
Of the 32 acts that performed there -- I had 4 (well 5) faves.
Number 1 was Jefferson Airplane.
But right behind them was  ‚Ä¢  Joe Cocker  ‚Ä¢  Sly Stewart  ‚Ä¢  Creedence -- and (of course)  ‚Ä¢  Janis !!
                     Your video ?
      Watched it multiple times ?
I did.
Thanks. Thoughts?
In fact -- at 2000 G / 1900 P -- I got your "Appleton" message.
And spent the next hour and 10 minutes writing up 5+ pages of notes that I will (someday) share with you.
Almost forgot to return to the chatroom.
How was Appleton ?
It was okay. Wolf and I prefer OshKosh. We just had to pick up some smoke-ables and vaporizables.
Why do you decide not to share those 5+ pages of notes with us today? I'm curious.
I never said that.
I used the word "someday".
     Just a "teaser".
üòä
"someday" could very well be "today".
Okay. I guess I look forward to "someday" arriving then. Today would be nice.
Actually -- the 5 pages are only the tip-of-the-iceberg of what I would like to share.
I have tons of comments.
Please share some.
     And quite a few questions too.
One question first.
     How much prep-time did you put into your 10:14 video ?
Almost none.
And why was that ?
Wolf: "It was my first time on... doing that."
Ok Wolf.   Good answer.
Pip -- same question please.
I prepared what I had for my computer profile and arranging the few vivid Red props I had to color-coordin8 things a bit nicely, and figured I'd just record something unrehearsed and casual with Wolf here and then just upload it since it seemed to come off pretty decently, turning just 2 minutes of source-material into another 8 minutes of our own rel8d thoughts.
I'd like to become more comfortable having a camera running and speaking personably into it clearly.
Good.
GOP
I figure I'll just get it rolling this Year, and leave myself room to improve.
lol
ok
I'm hoping to record and upload another 8-10 minute video by Tuesday, Jan. 12th, then another on the 16th, then 19th, then 25th... and so on hopefully on or close to those Days every Month.
"Tuesdays With Wolf & Pip"
I'm probably not going to script much or do any post-production editing for a while. Just see what I can do with minimal effort or prepR8ion to start with.
         Sounds good to me.
üòä
Thanks. Glad you like our style.  üòä
       Did I say that ?!
Define "style" please.
Tuesdays with Wolf && Pip sounds good to you. I read into it that you like what we've done and can do.
So then 2 nights ago, did you say you have like 9 PCA items and 23 questions or something like that?
Hmm.
w8.
Let's not mix 2 topics into this casserole at once please.
The 9 & 23 are about an entirely different subject.
Okay. Sorry. Yeah, let's continue on the video.
The 9 && 23 l8r.
             And we'll get around to that -- when it's time.
The video  :::
You've already said a number of things which we could (advantageously) explore further.
But let's start with -- you had said:
     "I figure I'll just get it rolling this Year, and leave myself room to improve."
I sense a somewhat cavalier bent to this video undertaking.
And -- I wish not to press forth any judgment about that.
But -- I have another Q.
     Puedo ?
Yeah. I'd like to eventually get into a groove, a good routine, become somewhat formulaic and consistent about putting out at least 4 videos each Month, but to start with, just leaving myself leeway to get a somewhat slow and lack-luster start. L8r I can work on polish and professionalism I think.
Proceed.
Ok. 
Thank you.
That answers quite a few of my questions.
And -- it also tells me that (at least) 115 minutes of the 120+ minutes of things that I had written down to possibly share with you -- should be held for another day.
H'ever.
If you'd like to stay (a little while longer) on this "video" topic -- why don't you ask me questions -- if you'd like.
Okay. Did you find what Wolf and I said on the topic of "Love" to be worthwhile things to voice?
Sorry -- lost Gchat again.
Ok -- on the last question --
"Okay. Did you find what Wolf and I said on the topic of "Love" to be worthwhile things to voice?"
        Yes.
Did you (and you) ?
I did. It should be a good intro to delving into the topic more deeply l8r.
Wolf: "Yeah. For my first video, yep."
Ok.   Another question.   I'm guess you upped this on Tue (the 5th).
How can I tell the date-of-upload ?
I uploaded it just today, but we recorded it last Saturday.
I tried to upload it earlier in the Week from a different browser ("Epiphany"), but that attempt failed. FireFox succeeded today though.
Beneath the title of the video, it usually says how many views and how long ago it was posted. It is probably also down from the video itself of when it went up.
Sorry again for the delay -- major Gchat issues.
Thank you for your patience.
It's okay.
Hopefully you'll run FireFox someday and experience fewer difficulties.
Ok.
I've got:
8 views   Jan 8, 2021
below the video window.
So -- that date coincides with when you actually upped it -- yes ?
Yes. Uploaded it today. Recorded last Saturday.
Got it.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
8 views.
0 comments.
Did you wish comments ?
Please comment, if you could care to.
Yes, please.
No -- not me -- I know you want some from me.
I'm asking about the other 7.
Did you wish comments from those 7 ?
Yes.
Or -- don't care ?
Yes.
Ok.
You'd like comments from them.
Why ?
Few viewers post thumbs-up like / dislike or comments though, so I'll probably need hundreds of views before there can be that level of engagement with any of my content.
Ok.   Good answer.
Thank you.
Next Q.
I'd like feedback. Comments about the topic, or just my process so far would be welcome.
Why did 7 people watch your video ?
Maybe YouTube's algorithms recommended it to them.
And that is based on what -- do you suppose ?
Maybe expect8ion that people who subscribe to Lex Fridman's PodCast already might be interested in others commenting on his material.
Ah so.
Ok.   Thank you.
2 more questions.   Please take them -- in order -- sequentially.
#1  -  why do you believe that most people post videos on YouTube ?
"most people"
#1: Because most people want their videos to be watched by the general public and to become popular.
Ok.   I got that part.   I'm guessing that the term "general public" essentially means "a lot of people" -- yes ?
Yes, and "a lot of people that probably don't know me yet and have never heard of me before".
Ok.   Now the second question.
         not "most people"
Why do *you* want to post videos on YouTube ?
Many reasons. To become well-known by an eventual audience. To show off some of Octology running smoothly and well. To become popular. To have another crE8ive outlet. To formul8 and express my opinions and insights. To eventually attract p8rons and sponsors for supplementary income.
Ok.
Thank you.
So -- is the additional income the ultimate goal/intent ?
In a sense... but the other goals also should remain valuable as things intended for too.
Ok.
Thank you.
You've answered my 2 questions.
Do you have another Q for me ?
No more at the moment.
Ok.
Wolf ?
Anything from you ?
Wolf: "No, not right at this moment."
Ok.
Pip -- you used the word "polish" a bit earlier -- and said that you would get around to attending to that later -- but you are concerned with heavily pressing into that endeavor -- at the moment.
I'm ok with that -- as long as you are.
However -- just know these 2 things.
    #1  -  Your Dad (for himself) is always into polish.
   #2  -  Your Dad is an expert on "Presentations Polish".
So -- when it's time -- I'll be here for you (in that department) -- as much as you'd like me to be.
(//)
Thank you. I will try to keep you in mind for when I become ready to focus more intently on polish.
You're welcome.
     Just enjoy doing these videos.
          If it stops being fun -- maybe it's time to halt 'em.
(//)
Wolf: "Talking more and seeing myself on the computer can get me more used to potentially narr8ing for FtR scripts in seminars, in front of audiences."
That sounds like a good idea Wolf.
But -- you understand that -- the FTR's Script Narrator -- will be un-visual (invisible) always.
Yes ?
W: "Mm hmm."
What we commonly refer to as "The Voice of God".   It just magically comes from "who knows where".
Wolf: "I look forward to the opportunity to read your scripts and books and stuff. It would help me too."
He is not a strong rEader yet. He needs practice rEading. He doesn't know how to write yet, and will have to learn that skill.
Good.
First -- to Wolf:
There are no books.
Just about 600 Scripts.
Scripts run about 8 to 10 minutes in typical length.
The "James Allen" script (of course) was not written by my hand -- but it is a good example of the type of material that nearly every one of the FTR Scripts are focused on.
W: "Okay."
FTR's Narrator (really) does not need to be able to "write" at all -- even though that is a generally valuable skill to have.
However -- the ability to "read" is a definite *must* for our Narrator.
And not only read -- but also be a master in "delivery".
W: "Yeah. I can deliver."
As you join Pip in producing these "Tuesday" videos -- you will get lots of opportunity to develop refined "delivery" skills.
I cannot stress enough -- the importance of doing your "57" after each one of them.
     And -- come to think of it -- writing is necessary to do your "57".
My channels will not only be on Tuesdays. Sorry if you got that mistaken impression. I aim to be active next Tuesday. I plan to eventually focus on the 12th, 16th, 19th, and 25th of every Month.
Ah ha.
I don't recommend that plan.
But -- these are your videos -- not mine.
My channels: CC8 (CaptainCaption8) on each 12th (starting next Tue.), GG (GuyGooway) on the 16ths, JJ8 (JewJesus8) on the 19ths, and PP (PedantPip) on every 25th. About 2 Weeks of intense work for my 4 YouTube channels each Month, then about 2 Weeks off or doing minor prepR8ion.
You must do as you deem best.
             (  Axiom #18  )
Are you off on another trip to Appleton ?
Nope. We're just watching a Lex Fridman PodCast.
    'S been 19¬Ω minutes of quietness.
So -- are we done for this evening, mes eleves ?
Wolf: "Do you have any more questions for me?"
NATM -- BIW.
Not at the moment -- but I will (have more later, if I may).
Hearing no substantive reply -- I guess it's time for me to say:
Thank you Wolf (and Pip) for this chat gentlemen.
I ‚ù§
 you Wolf.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
You're welcome.
Stamp me ?
Wolf: "Thank you very much. In time I'll love you too."

Sat Jan  9 00:20:18:13 -0600 2021
Good night Dad.
Good night Son & Wolf.
6'01-09-21 - 0121 Gtime / 0021 Ptime
Wolf: "Good night."
sniff   sniff
No love from you.
It's ok -- I'll get                                           over it.
6'01-09-21 - 0122 Gtime / 0022 Ptime
L1FLJ00L
Hi Dad. How are you?
5'01-15-21 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Shabbat Shalom Philip.
I am well.
Wolf: "Hi. Glad to talk again."
Thank you for asking.
I am celebrating.
You're welcome. We're good here too.
Your week went well ?
It did, thanks.
You said "we".
Is Wolf in-the-house ?
Yep. He just said "Hi." above.
üòä
Hello Wolf.
     Good to see you again.
Wolf: "What are you celebrating?"
Oh.
Didn't Pip tell you.
?
The day that made him possible.
Wolf: "Let me guess. Your anniversary?"
That's the baby.
üòä
Married in Hollywood.
Saturday evening.
At the top of Highland Avenue.
Wolf: "July 7th 1990 was my marriage to Barbie."
January 15, 1972.
W: "Congratulations!"
About 2¬Ω years after you went to Woodstock.
Thank you.
I can't figure Pip out.
He remembers me on my birthday.
He remembers me on Christmas.
He remembers me on Father's Day.
I try to. Don't always remember those.
But -- I've never gotten an Anniversary Card from him.
January 15th is harder for me to remember.
Maybe now that he has you for a friend --
     you might remind him.
Maybe some Year I will remember today too.
Had there been no wedding -- he would not be your friend !!
Wolf: "Well I'm glad he is."
Me                   too.
üòä
üòä
Wolf: "What do you plan to do with your stimulus check?"
What makes you think I got one ?
W: "Everybody is supposed to get one."
Did you get one ?
W: "Not yet... but soon."
Did they tell you how much ?
We've heard these ones are supposed to be $600 each.
As of last Friday -- Pip told me that he did not get one.
Hmm.
600 is nice.
Yeah, I still haven't received one.
Hopefully soon, my Payee will get it on my behalf.
Mine came.
W: "All right!"
Not sure on its use yet -- but I highly suspect --
it will go toward my current Tera problems.
                     (my desktop computer)
Hopefully you'll get Tera in good working condition again soon.
                I hope too.
We'll be talking about that.
Biden says that after the $600 check, we're supposed to get a $1400 check after that.
        What are you going to use yours for Wolf ?
Wolf: "Pip and I are going to buy computers (laptops)... so I can learn how to do it."
That's nice from him -- but I think I want to hear
Hopefully we'll be able to set him up with internet-access at his apartment too.
what he says 5 days from now (first).
Pip -- has Wolf picked out a machine yet ?
I've recommended we both purchase the same PineBook64 machines which should run us about $200 each.
Wow.
           Cheap !!
That way we'll be able to figure things out for each other easily.
Yeah.
Probably pretty good bargain. Hopefully they'll work out decently well for both of us.
If I can get Octology running well on both of them, maybe you could buy one and I could set all my software up on it for you too. We'll see.
Hmm.
Do you have specs on it ?
Yeah, they have a $200 version that's better than the $100 one.
The only specific8ion I remember right now is 1920x1080 resolution. I forget the others right now.
Ah ha.
SPECIFICATIONS
‚Ä¢Allwinner A64 Quad Core SOC with Mali 400 MP2 GPU
‚Ä¢2GB LPDDR3 RAM
‚Ä¢1080p IPS Panel
‚Ä¢Bootable Micro SD Slot
‚Ä¢16GB of eMMC (upgradable)
‚Ä¢HD Digital Video Out
‚Ä¢2x USB 2.0 Host
‚Ä¢Lithium Polymer Battery (10000mAH)
‚Ä¢Stereo Speakers
‚Ä¢WiFi 802.11bgn + Bluetooth 4.0
‚Ä¢Headphone Jack
‚Ä¢Microphone
‚Ä¢0.3 MPx Front-Facing Camera
‚Ä¢Full-Sized Keyboard
‚Ä¢Large Trackpad
‚Ä¢3.5mm OD/1.35mm ID (5V 3A) Port
              Does that look about right ?
That looks like it. Yep.
2 Gig of RAM looks mighty thin -- but I believe it'll be sufficient to get you guys up on Windows 10 -- and onto the Internet.
Plus -- it will accept Octology -- right ?
We should be running Ubuntu GNU/Linux instead of MicroSoft Windows.
I don't think it comes with Windows licenses. Ubuntu is free though and there's some indic8ion that it should run smoothly on the hardware.
I thought you said you wanted to get Octology onto a Windows platform.
Oh.
I see.
I still do want to do that at some point, but probably cannot do so yet.
Wolf: "I'm computer-iller8. I have to learn from scratch."
We all start from there in our learning of everything !!
W: "This should be a good learning experience."
When Pip was born -- he didn't know how to walk.
But -- he started from                          scratch.
           And -- he's fairly good at it now.
üòä
üòä
W: "I learned to walk within a Year."
W: "Me and my big feet.  üòä
  "
Yep Wolf.
The rule is:
     Walk at one.
     Talk at two.
     Get a computer at 62.
üòä
W: "LoL!  üòä
"
Yes Pip -- I notice that my "spec list" does not tell us of an OS at all.   Yes ?
Correct.
14 double-D --right ?
Feet.
You weren't using those at age 1 -- were you ?
W: "12 triple-E. I wear a 14-D cowboy boot though."
Where do you park your horse in Osh ?
W: "No, not at age 1. When I hit 12 or 13, that's when I started wearing a 12 triple-E."
W: "Hahaha!"
W: "I wish I had a horse. I grew up with them."
W: "I also had 2 German Shepherds and they bred when I was about 9 and they had 18 puppies."
So Dad, is anything on your PCA for tonight?
Yep.   At least 4 items.
But -- I'm having too much fun here.
     Do we need to go to PCAs ?
W: "Me too."
No, we can w8.
üòä
Wolf: "I can't w8 to come up there to meet you."
W: "I used to live in Allentown, Pennsylvania. I lived there for about 9 Months."
Hopefully once I have another friend here I can trust to take care of Darjee while we're gone, it would be nice if Wolf and I could take a trip to visit you for a Day or 2.
I've heard of Allentown.
Billy Joel did a song about that place -- didn't he ?
W: "Yep."
When were you there ?
W: "Oh, I don't remember the Year. It was in my teens. Maybe 17."
You turned 17 in September of 1975 -- yes ?
W: "I would think so."
Did you listen to the radio there ?
W: "Hmm. I don't know. I don't remember."
Ok.
Pip's Mom & I lived in Allentown -- for (exactly) 9 months.
March to December -- in 1972.
W: "Right after there, I went to Vermont. Stayed there for about a Month. Got caught in a river. Was safe from that though. Then went back to Florida and then to Wisconsin."
     You were 14.
W: "I got confused. I was 21 when I came up here. I've been all over the place. I don't remember all the places."
Did you live near Burlington ?
W: "Winuski, right next to Burlington."
Ah yes -- Winooski is actually "Northern Burlington.
I visited Burlington in October of 2012.
W: "I swam in the Winooski river, off a waterfall."
               Beati fullll !!
Wow !!
                   Is this it ?
 W: "Yep. That's it. I used to swim right there. That's Pearl Street."
üòä
I went for a hot-air balloon ride in that area.
     We could see the falls from the balloon.
W: "Oh, that's cool!"
'Twas indeed.
                                  I loved it !!
W: "I went for a hot-air balloon ride in Stinky-Creak Tennessee, on my honeymoon."
s/Creak/Creek/;
You and Barbie ?
W: "No, Barbie didn't go. She was afraid of heights."
W: "I went for a helicopter ride too."
I love helicopters.
Especially the Bell 206.
What year were you married ?
W: "July 7th, 1990."
31¬Ω.
How old was she ?
W: "Barbie was umm... uhh 20. I think she was about 20 when we were married."
And where is she now ?
W: "Lives in Oshkosh. She is the Treasurer of Omro, Wisconsin."
W: "We're still good friends."
Ah ha.
Good.
Well -- here is in memory of your honeymoon.
Oh -- but that's July.
            Here is October.
W: "Yep. I remember that sign well."
W: "Barb and I drove all the way from Oshkosh to there. She has family in Stinking Creek."
W: "We didn't have to pay for a room or nothin'. We had 4 different places to stay."
That was nice.
You remember the bridge ?
W: "Yes. Very well."
             Well -- if I zoom out ?
W: "Yep. Walked across it many times. Used to go hiking in the woods and the forest."
I haven't seen much of Tennessee.
         Just a bit of Memphis really.
W: "Barbie's ancestors are from the Cherokee N8ion, just on the other side of the mountains."
You met here there ?
W: "No. I met her in Oshkosh."
Oh.
W: "We d8d for 3 Years before we got married."
3 years is a good prep.
Dottie and I did 2¬Ω.
W: "Mmm."
W: "Yeah, we were married for 21 Years."
Pip visited Memphis with me and Dot and Ange and Tim in 1981.
He had just turned 4.
We knocked on Elvis' door.
W: "Haha. I'm an old man.  üòä
"
-- but he didn't answer.
                Guess he wasn't home.
W: "I was a big Elvis fan, but I never went there."
And -- you called it quits in 2011 ?
              Wanna share why ?
W: "Yeah. It's a long story."
I've got an appointment in April.
     Can you share the story by then ?
W: "Someday."
Ok.
          I can w8.
W: "It was a good divorce. We're both still good friends."
Dot and I saw Elvis in person -- in Las Vegas -- at The International Hotel.
1971.
W: "Wow!"
W: "I saw RedFox in Vegas."
W: "I don't remember where. In a casino, but I don't remember which one."
At that time -- part of his show was to do "Love Me Tender" -- and in the middle of the singing of it -- (a long version) -- about 7 or 8 minutes -- he would kiss every girl who came up front to the stage.
I told Dottie to go up.
"You'll never have this chance again!"
W: "Yep. Did she?"
            But she wouldn't.
W: "Barbie's Mom would've fainted if that happened to her. She was a big Elvis fan."
I said:             "Ok.   If you won't -- is it ok if I go up and get your kiss for you -- and then I'll bring it back -- and deliver it to you ?"
üòä
W: "She had every piece of Elvis memorabilia you could find. Thousands of dollars worth of stuff."
No.                         I   did   not   go.
I was told that Elvis did that in every Las Vegas show -- for a number of years.
                           What a guy !!
He loved his fans.
W: "Yes, he did."
How was Red Fox ?               Good show ?
Wolf: "Mmm. Swore a lot."
Yep.   I guess so.
                 That's why I never cared for him.
W: "I didn't either. It was a free show, so I went to it."
He was a funny man.                 He really didn't need that language.
W: "Yeah, true."
Free ?           Why ?
W: "I was with some people who let me in for free."
I see.              And you saw.
üòä
Ok.   It's trivia quiz time.
You can play too Pip.
Are you both ready for the question ?
W: "Oh, no. I'm bad with trivia."
Okay.
W: "Sure."
Good.
Here it comes.
Burlington, Vermont is a town -- which holds a distinction which no other town in the other 49 states can match.
What is it ?
W: "I haven't a clue. All I know is the ski-resort, named after Dewey's family."
I don't know either.
W: "The fastest winds in the country?"
Who is Dewey ?
W: "He was like my second Dad. He brought me to Wisconsin."
Hmm.
Haven't met him.
Did you say "thank you" to him ?
W: "He died about 14 Years ago."
These rumors abound.
W: "Oh, yes. All the time. I thanked him a lot for... we were inseparable."
That's good.
W: "He was a schoolteacher in GreenLake."
           Although -- based on Wisconsin's weather -- I'm not sure he did you a favor !!
I like schollteachers.
W: "Oh, yes he did. I love Wisconsin weather."
        I are 1 2.
W: "I walk around in the Winter in shorts and tank-tops, if I can help it."
lol
Well -- somebody's gotta make the cheese.
üòä
W: "LoL. Yep. I worked on a dairy-farm making cheese, for 8 Years."
I'll stick with avocado country myself -- thank you.
Of course you did.
            And I think you for it.
What is your favorite cheese ?
W: "Bleu-cheese."
/think/  /thank/
W: "... and Habanero Cheese."
Ah so.
And yours Pip ?
Hmm. Probably Habanero or like Ghost-Pepper or even just Spicy-Jack maybe... but I also dig Smoked String as well I guess. Not too much of a cheese guy myself."
Oops.
No double-quote intended on the end there. s/"//;
W: "Appleton has a Scorpion-Cheese. Supposed to be one of the hottest in the world."
Pip likes HOT stuff.
Usually, yeah.
I don't cotton to much of anything warmer that an iced tea myself.
W: "Haha!"
And -- I can't eat Habanero -- because --
-- I don't have the right hat !!
W: "Haha. LoL big time."
Now --
     as much as I've enjoyed all of this --
          I suspect you guys are just trying to skirt the "Burlington" issue -- Yes ?
W: "I don't know the answer."
We just got diverted temporarily onto favorite cheeses. We can get back to Burlington.
Ok.
W: "There is no monster in the Lake."
I didn't know that !!
But that's not Burlington's "famous for".
I shall share it here.
W: "Maple syrup?"
     Write it down please.
No -- the whole state is famous for that Wolf.
     But good try.
Sorry, but just having this chat log will hopefully suffice. Neither of us are in good shape to write anything right now.
It's ok.
It just happens to be something that all teachers are required to say -- at least 7 times per hour -- in the classroom.
Burlington is the smallest largest city in all 50 of our states.
W: "I didn't know that. Thanks for sharing."
       Are you writing it down, mes eleves ?
You're welcome Wolf.
The chat history will keep it for us. Wolf doesn't know how to write yet, and I am busy typing.
Complain.             Complain.               Complain.
üòä
Well it's almost 9PM here, so I'm thinking we should try to start wrapping things up for the night.
What about my PCA ?
Yeah, maybe we can schedule for trying again tomorrow or Sunday night?
Oh yeah ?
I probably need to give Wolf a ride home shortly, unless he's sure he wants to walk?
Which ?
Let's try for tomorrow (Saturday) night at our usual time.
That works for me.
Cool. Hopefully see you then.
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
Thank you to both of you for a very enjoyable chat tonight.
Wolf: "XXOO"
I ‚ù§
 you both.
You're welcome. Thank you goo.
s/goo/too/;
Got 'em Wolf.
Thank you so much.
W: "Gr8!"
You're welcome goo.

Good Evening Dad.
6'01-16-21 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
And how was your Saturdays ?
Plural because you each had one -- yes ?
So-so. Wolf stayed home to watch the Packer game.
How was yours?
Ah ha.
You can't get the Packers at Mallard ?
Maybe I could. Not sure. Don't have regular TV. Just Cable/Internet.
I see.
Why was it a so-so day ?
Wanted to be productive but couldn't really get "in-gear".
Maybe you need a new clutch.
Yeah.
     Or -- is your transmission automatic ?
üòä
I had a good day.
I'm glad.
     Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
But -- the best is yet to come !!
I sense this may be a quiet evening.
Are you troubled by something ?
Sorry, yeah. I don't have much to say or much on my mind right now.
Feel pretty listless and tired.
Well -- I have a list.
Would you rather postpone until tom night ?
Maybe. Could that work out just fine for you?
Possibly.
Could we do just one tonight ?
Thanks for your flexibility. Hopefully I will be in a better mood tomorrow night.
Yeah. Go ahead.
Ok.
Thank you.
Do you have a backup system for Oni ?
Sort of.
GOP
All 4 of my desktops have much hardware compatibility. Each are configured quite similarly in software too.
Aku(ma) is my main backup for Oni. Then Ryu. Then Ken.
In reverse order of them being built, thus Ken has the oldest and basically worst parts. Oni has newest and best.
I see.
Do any of your machines have SSDs -- or are they all all HDDs ?
All HDDs, but I have 1 SSD w8ing a new setup for Oni. Just haven't gotten around to doing it for him yet.
Is that going to replace Oni's current harddrive -- or be additional ?
Additional.
A RAID1 system -- or ?
No. Without any RAID.
Oh.   Ok.   So -- are you going to use it as a backup for the primary drive -- or as an extension of your storage capacity ?
Well technically I'm going to keep the current HDD that's bootable in there as backup, then I'll install the SSD as primary new boot drive along with a new Cg8 2TB HDD for mainly media d8a-storage on a few partitions where the SSD isn't the best option. So basically extension of storage capacity with much higher performance, but different wearing issues.
Talk to me about "wearing issues" please.
SSD's wear differently than HDD's. Find articles on it. I can't explain it better than they can.
Ok.
Thank you.
If I were to get an external drive to use as a "mirror" backup for Tera -- would you recommend an SSD or a HDD ?
HDD is probably better external, but I haven't researched SSD as altern8ive for that purpose, so I might change my mind if I did. Not sure.
Ok.
Thank you.
And -- thank you for tonight's chat Pip.
I appreciate it.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
You're welcome.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Hopefully chat with you more tomorrow night. I ‚ù§
you too.
Thank you Pip.

Good Evening Philip.
And how are you this evening ?
I'm good. Thanks. How are you?
I think I'm ok.
Thank you for asking.
I had a pretty lonnng snooze today.
Nice.
Yep.
Guess I needed it.
Are you in better spirits tonight than yester ?
Yes. Thanks.
You're welcome.
What would you like to chat about ?
Well I guess to be my usual pedantic self, I can mention that I usually prefer "mood" to "spirits" just as a matter of clarity, even when intent might remain pretty well understood.  üòâ
Ok.
Thank you.
Scratch my last question please.
You're welcome.
I think mood is a less confused term, generally.
Let me try again.
Is your moood this evening gooder that 'twas last evening ?
Indeed, it is.  üòä
üòä
s/that/than/;
Xcellent !!
                      Yep.   "than"    Thank you.
U R wLcome.
üòä
So I don't have too much prepared to try to discuss tonight from my end. Anything you'd like to get into?
Yes.
Now ?
Let's.
Good.
Thank you.
One (small) lingering thing from Friday night.
Wedding Anniversary -- and how to remember it.
Our Wedding Anniversary is a National Holiday.
Ah.
And (therefore) -- it is on the calendar.
We were married on Dr. King's 43 birthday.
Hmm. I thought tomorrow Jan. 18th was Dr. MLK Jr. Day this Year though. Why is that?
Most years (because of the "Monday Holiday" tradition in this country -- the calendar suggests that we were married -- somewhere between January 15th and January 21st.
Aha.
But on some years (like 2024) -- it hits it on the button.
Cool.
Dr. King hasn't complained about this discrepancy -- so Dot & I have decided to follow his lead -- and just live with the idea that The United States honors us -- even if they are off on the true date by several days most years.
I would guess that usually after a divorce, a wedding anniversary would not be an occasion which is traditional to commemor8, but I'll try to remember that you still celebr8 the d8.
Well -- since you brought that up -- here is how I see it:
Dottie got divorced.
Her husband did not.
I see.
Due to that perspective, Jan. 15th seems a bittersweet Day to me.
And -- whether any of that makes sense to you or not -- the fact remains that there are 7 children walking around this planet -- as a direct result of that "Sat Jan 15 1972" ceremony -- plus -- Mandy could not have had *her* wedding -- if Dot & I had not had ours.
Yes.
I can see how you might see it as somewhat "bittersweet" -- but I do not.
There was a time when the situation was painful (and sad) -- but I have better eyes now.
And I only celebrate the sweetness of our union --
Hmm.
because that is all that lingers within me.
May I please ask you a potentially painful question?
Dorothy Ellen Florence Mathews was the greatest teacher in my life -- and also remains my best friend ever.   Her wisdom and insights speak in my head often.   And I dream about her teaching (at least) once a week.
     In fact -- another just last night.
üòä
I shall love her forever.
And I'm glad that she has Rosie in her life.
Yes Pip.
Ask away please.
Doesn't it necessarily also linger somewhat that instead of sweetness, Dot turned out to be treacherous, abandoning you, back-stabbing you, and discarding you for her own rather selfish gain, when she lied about your abuses and insanity in the family-courts?
Or were you and are you insane?
You're still typing.
I'll w8.
Maybe you suffer from Aphasia at least. I am unsure. Sometimes you seem maybe pretty delusional, as I can be too. Maybe we both periodically suffer from BiPolar Disorder, or SchizoAffective, or Schizophrenia. I'm not sure.
Yeah, sorry. Got off on a tangent sort of, there.
I believe you answered your own questions for yourself.
Yes ?
I don't know.
Sanity and lack of it perplexes me. Sometimes I think what is called and considered "normal" is pretty nutty.
lol
üòä
Regarding Aphasia, I heard in an intriguing video on YouTube recently that some p8ients experience renewed ability to speak by spending time trying to hum lyrics to songs they've loved and known well the words to. Have you ever tried anything like that?
Maybe you could spend some time trying to sing along to "You're the Inspir8ion" by Chicago, or other Beatles tracks that you've always loved. Maybe with time, attempting such could enable you to vocalize words again.
I do better than hum.   I sing (with full lyrics) in my head -- nearly every day.
Ah. Have you tried to make the corresponding vocal sounds though too?
I wish you could speak again, maybe more than even you do.
There are a number of people that wish I could speak again.
Each one has their own reason (or reasons).
What is yours -- if you'd like to share ?
Probably several reasons, which I will try to share some of now.
Good.
Thank you.
First, I'd like us to be capable of chatting over the phone, in addition to typing together online, as we already have made a nice regular practice of.
It has been a very long time since I've heard your voice, and it saddens me that I may never get to hear you speak my name or convey pride in me vocally again.
I imagine that your life would become much easier if you were able to speak again. Most people can and do speak so routinely that it's unimaginable how different things might become if that ability were lost somehow. I'd like your road to be less rough.
I think you could have a much better chance of making Fix-The-Radio successful (as well as your other pursuits) if you were able to narr8 for yourself, or at least vocally guide whoever you ultim8ly get to fill that role. I think Wolf remains genuinely interested in being a candid8 you could consider and coach to coax into the role. We'll see. Hopefully he will be getting a laptop and online from his apartment within the next Month or 2, so hopefully you two can e-mail and chat directly together after then to discuss such possibilities.
I think you have many thoughts and ideas which you consider to be important to have said... literally spoken aloud. Pieces-of-Light. Axioms. Nuggets of wisdom. I wish you could say whatever you wanted to.
All good ones Pip.
Thank you.
Any others ?
That covers it for me, for now. I will let you know if I think of any other biggies worth mentioning l8r.
Ok.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
If you still would prefer to be capable of speaking for yourself, I wish you could become able to again somehow... especially because your life would probably be less difficult as a result.
All 6 things that you just shared -- suggest to me -- things that I could say in response.
However -- I'm not sure that any of that is really important.
Your sharing of your feelings with me is greatly appreciated -- and cherished.
Thank you so much Pip.
You're very welcome, Dad.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
I got it.   I feel it.   I love it.              Thank you Pip.
                You are a treasure !!
So are you Dad!
üòä
üòä
Might you please tell me what might be your own top reason why you'd like to become able to speak again?
Well --
all 6 that you mentioned -- sound like pretty good ones to me.
However --
Right on.
because your said "top" -- the one which is most frontal in my soul -- is the one about the FTR Seminars.
I started teaching --
about 3 months after I turned 12 years of age.
And -- it is my most favorite thing in the world to do.
Always.
Well -- next to breathing (I guess).
üòä
üòä
  I thought maybe next to eating too... just like Josh (I guess) !  üòâ
Hmm.
No.   Eating is further down the list.
What did you teach to who (at 12 Years-old)?
My (over)eating is not (really) from an affection for food.
It is a flaw within me.
I use food as a drug.
In November of 1955 (near the beginning of 7th Grade) -- one of my Junior High School teachers came to me -- and asked if I would be willing to tutor a number of my fellow stus in mathematics.   ‚Ä¢   Everyone knew that I was a "wiz" at it -- both teachers and students alike.   ‚Ä¢   And (of course) I said:  "yes".
Sweet!
And -- for the first 36 years -- I taught with my mouth open.
In October of 1991 -- one thing changed.
No -- I did not stop teaching.
In fact -- at that time -- I was a Business Consultant -- in San Luis Obispo.
And my clients (up until that time) heard my voice plenty.
But my teaching did not stop.
It just changed.
In the beginning of 1992 (January) -- I moved from California to the east coast again.
And in Wilmington, North Carolina -- I was teaching in a local college again.
And later that year (1992) and into 1993 -- I was teaching at another college in Reading, Pennsylvania.
I've never stopped teaching.
The FTR Project presents some new challenges.
But we shall solve them.
The way it looks right now -- we won't be (truly) starting our Seminars until around the late-Spring or early-Summer of 2022.
So we've got time to prepare for all of that.
I am at --
(//)
Nice. Peace is usually good. Glad you're there with things.
Me too.
My hope is that you get there too Pip.
Hmm. Yeah, in many ways, I remain at peace with life. Some rel8ively minor parts of me want to go to war though too, in the events that peace proves inadequ8 to bring about needed change, primarily.
The largest of all of the problem with war -- whether between nations -- or just between 2 people -- or even within our own self -- is -- that there is *never* a winner.
In every case -- always -- *both sides lose* !!
/problem/  /problems/
That may be true, in some critical senses, but may be overlooking the fact that usually one side of a war loses significantly more than the other, and can be meaningfully said to be the gr8r "loser".
Loss is loss.
Period.
Many things have been gained by the victors of past wars though too.
Yes, war may always necessit8 there being losses of some kind or another, on both sides... but it is also possible for sides to gain much by waging war too, which potentially can gr8ly outweigh the losses of that side.
If 2 nations go to war.   And "Side A" loses 10,000 lives -- and is "called" the losing nation -- and "Side B" loses only 1 life -- and is "called" the winning nation -- and you are the mother of that 1 life lost by the winning nation --
are you a happy loser ?
Possibly. Depends what else is at stake.
If governance over the combined land of each respective adversarial n8ion is determined by which one "wins", then there might be a "happy loser" of a mother who lost a soldier son but kept her home and the rest of her family and her country intact.
Said more succinctly and generically: "Some things are worth fighting and dying for."
Have you and your Dad ever had a fight ?
Probably not any physical fight between us before, no... but I think our respective minds have jousted quite a large number of times intellectually, and are quite likely to continue to go "toe-to-toe" many times again ahead.
Right now, our minds could be said to be fighting each other about whether we've ever "fought" before!  üòâ
LoL. Pretty silly.
I agree.
Yes.   The peoples of humanity *are* pretty silly.
But when they start "talking" with bullets -- this farrr beyond being silly.
‚òú(Ôæü„ÉÆÔæü‚òú) farrr/  /this is farrr/
that didn't come out right
don't know what happened
I get it.
‚òú(Ôæü„ÉÆÔæü‚òú) farrr/  /this is farrr/
hrumph
Bullets talking almost always say very serious (not silly) things.
same mess
I went to Vietnam in 1966.
Took (my) M-14 "brother-killer" (rifle) with me.
Never fired it.
Not even for training?
Not even to test whether it was still working properly --
which was were all encouraged to do every few weeks.
It has a rather ominous name there.
Guns are made to kill things.
If for food -- maybe that's ok.
Many are made for target practice primarily.
Marksman competitions.
Even Olympic events.
But -- to use them to kill my brothers -- I do not cotton to that -- nor will I ever.
Does "cotton" there mean like "condone" or something?
You ask about training.   I was "trained" to shoot the M-14 here in the states.
I did not balk from that.
It was required of us.
And do you consider every human being to be your "brother"?
But -- when I got to Vietnam -- I was not required to use it.
Only to keep it clean -- which I did.
That's interesting.
Your last question.
Do you (really) need me to answer that one ?
You know I do.
Even people who would wish you dead are considered your misguided "brothers" too?
Yes Pip -- in this context -- "cotton" could be translated as "condone".
Makes sense, from context.
But -- a more general definition of "cotton" -- would be:  "find myself attracted to"/
Ah.
However -- in the above context -- you were correct -- "condone" is good.
Cool. So may we please move on to your other PCA items next?
lol
You're sick of this one huh ?
üòä
Me too.
It just seems sufficiently wrapped up for now, but we can discuss more of it, if you'd prefer us to?
No -- been laid aside.   I'm at peas with that.
     Thank you for a good discussion.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
                    And no bruises on either of us too !!
üòä
Haha.  üòä
You're welcome Pip.
Not this time... but just you w8! I'll bruise your ego one of these Years!  üòâ
So -- we're done (then) with the "Wedding Anniversary" PCA -- and what-all that
transitioned to.
Cool.
Ready for my next PCA ?
Yep. Shoot.
Good.
Here it comes.
 
Back on Friday November 6th 2020 -- you told
me that you were "2 days sober" -- staying off
both THC (marijuana) and amphetamines -- and
that your plan was to stay off them and alcohol,
et cetera -- for good.   ‚Ä¢   And furthermore --
that it was your intention to (henceforth) be
using only legal caffeine and nicotine.
That only lasted for a couple weeks. I've returned to using a bit of amphetamines and THC weekly.
I may try to stay sober again at some point, but am no longer trying to adhere to that for now.
 
This means you began this journey on Wednesday,
November 4th 2020 -- and that would make today
(Sunday January 17 2021) -- Day #74.
 
So -- I've been wanting to ask you --
have you been successful for the 74 ?
Oh -- sorry.
I have not. I stayed sober for about 2 or 3 weeks, then returned to my previous usage tendency to have a little each week.
You answered this while I was thrown off of Gchat -- and trying to get back in.
That's okay.
Well -- thank you for the update.
What caused you to initiate that resolution back in November ?
You're welcome. I will try to let you know if I decide to remain sober again, but until then you should be able to assume I use a little each week.
A lot of reasons made me resolve to stay sober back in November. I remained that way for the majority of that Month.
The main reason was wanting to make it more likely I could get off this Mental Health Commitment I have with Winnebago County here.
I also wanted to stop wasting my money on poor quality substances and have more to spend on other things I need and want.
There are upsides and downsides to using for me, which make it quite a challenge to stay off amphetamines in particular. I can usually do without THC pretty easily.
And have you decided that (a) being in the MH Commitment is desirable -- and (b) not having money to spend on other things is good for you ?
No. I'm still hoping I can get off the Commitment eventually, even if it isn't as soon as might be possible if I were to remain sober.
Similarly, I still wish I could have more money to spend on other things, but purchasing some amphetamines with the discretionary monies I get still seems worth affording on usually a weekly basis.
Ok.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Apparently -- it is not your "time" to become sober yet.
And I say "good".
Yeah. Not yet.
üòä
I have a few more Qs on this.
Puedo ?
Proceed.
Thank you.
Have you thought about what might happen to your relationships with Mom, Ange, and Tim -- if you were to report to them that you had your 2 or 3-month chip for sobriety ?
I have thought about that somewhat, but I'm not all that concerned with trying to rekindle close rel8ionships with any of the 3 of them.
Ok.
That's a reasonable answer.
Thank you Pip.
I've been a mostly responsible substance-taker (i.e., drug-user, but not abuser) throughout my adult life. If they can't rel8 well with me as I truly am, then I'm probably better off without them.
Maybe I will get and stay sober someday though, and then reconnecting and rebuilding kinship with them might become possible again, and I might see it as worth doing at that point. We'll see, I guess.
Sounds fine.
Everything in its proper time.
Axiom #27.
Just 10 minutes ago, my d8 clock read: "L1HLLLLL" with 6 L's in it. In 4 Days, it will have 7 L's in it in my time-zone. Pretty rare and cool.
Yep.
You're a kool dude Pip.
üòä
That will be January 21st of 2021, in -0600 zone at 9PM, 21 minutes, 21 seconds, and 21 phasses (60ths-of-seconds).
One other thing on this subject.
Thanks.  üòä
Puedo ?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Here it is.
January is half over.   How is the Perl job search going ?
Pretty poorly so far. I've forgotten I was even wanting to try to pursue it seriously. Thanks for reminding me.
I should re-dedic8 myself to the search during the Weeks / Months ahead.
You're welcome.
I believe I hold (at least) 3 good things that could come out of that.
     ‚Ä¢   Get off of the MH Commitment
     ‚Ä¢   Get some desired computer equipment
     ‚Ä¢   Move to Venice
Yes ?
Yep. All things I want which would probably be better for me than what I've had.
Well.     I'm not gonna push you toward this Perl thing.
But I am going to ask you about it 23 times per week (or so).
üòä
Okay. There don't seem to be all that many opportunities out there for me to find. I may have to seek out more System Administr8or positions and job-boards, if I can find those.
I don't care what you do.
I care about 3 things.
(1)   You are bringing in supplementary income for the 3 things above.
(2)   You have the self-satisfaction that comes with gainful employment
(3)   You are happy with the direction that your life is going
(//)
Good things. Thank you for caring about all 3 of those.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
Love gives caring.
Yes.
So shall we maybe wrap this chat up for tonight and plan to reconvene Friday Jan. 22nd at our usual time?
                                          I'm thinking  ...  ...  ...
Sounds like a pretty good plan.
You realize -- we shall (by then) have a new President -- yes ?
Yes.
Ok.
If that's ok with you -- it's ok with me.
Cool. Thank you for such a delightful chat tonight.
I'll plan on the twenty-tooth -- for our next chat.
Me too.
You are welcome Pip.
My sentiments exactly.
Thank you.
You're welcome.  üòä
     Eye enjoyed it.
And                                                           I ‚ù§
 you.
I ‚ù§
you too.
                 4       ever     !!
üòä
Thank you Pip.

Good Evening Dad.
Good Evening Philip.  
Wolf is here with me again. We're both doing pretty well today. How are you?
Shabbat Shalom.
üòä
And how are you this evening ?
We're good. How are you?
Hello Wolf.
Good to see you again.
Did the Packers win ?
Wolf: "Hello back.  üòä
"
Wolf: "Yes, they're going to the Super Bowl!"
Wolf: "So I hope."
Wow!
Playing whom ?
Wolf: "They're probably playing the Chicago Bears next."
Next.
It's not for sure that they are in the S.B. yet ?
Wolf: "No, no, they're playing the Buccaneers."
It seems not quite decided yet.
Oh.
Have you ever been to one of their games in Green Bay ?
Wolf: "No. Never got there yet."
Hmm.
Wolf: "I went there one Year to clean the snow off the seats and got pictures of the field. Paid $15 / hour."
Wolf: "Too many people. Big crowds I don't like."
Ok.
So how has your week been Dad?
Pretty good -- thank you for asking.
And --
You're welcome.
I saw your question about "how I am" too.
Thank you for asking.
I am good.
Both Wolf and I are glad to hear that.
Didn't mean to ignore you.
Just got into the Packers first.
Sorry.
üòä
No worries.  üòä
Wolf: "I went to a Brewers / Cubs game in Chicago. Didn't like it. Too many people."
I am not sure that it is fair that your answer questions -- b4 I ask them !!
lol
I understand about lots of people.
Many people have a problem with that.
Why -- for you ?
Hopefully any unfairness can be forgiven.
All is fore-given.
         But then -- you knew that.
üòä
Wolf: "Well I feel claustrophobic around so many people. Except for one time I went to a wrestling match up in Green Bay. It was the last match."
Piece #24.
Whoops -- no.
Piece #25.
Sorry.
That's okay.
Shall I share my "Penn State" story ?
Both of us: "Yeah, please. We'd like to hear."
Ok.
 
It starts with a little quiz.
Ready ?
Both: "Yes."
Good.
 
What are the 2 largest cities (by population) in Pennsylvania ?
Wolf: "I don't know. Only place I have been in Pennsylvania was Allentown."
Pip: "Probably Philadelphia and Pittsburgh?"
Good Wolf -- we'll get back to that one shortly.
Correct Pip -- Philly & P-burgh.
And -- in that order (of course).
Now --
In the last half of the 20th Century -- Pennsylvania had 2 cities that were the 3rd largest city in the state.
No -- not a tie.
They alternated.
What were those 2 cities -- and why did they alternate ?
Wolf: "Hmm? Very interesting."
Pip: "My guess is: Allentown and some other, so all I can come up with is Reading? Maybe there was an exodus from one to the other for some reason?"
Good -- yes -- in the late 1900s -- Allentown was 3rd -- with about 106,000 people.
Ah, maybe they altern8d multiple times, jockeying for 3rd place over the last half of the 20th Century, so not just one giving way to the other, hmm?
You see Wolf -- I said we'd get back to that.
Wolf: "A guy I was helping there had an apartment building burn down and I helped him do dry-wall and carpeting in the whole place."
Very nice of you Wolf.
W: "It was fun. I learned new things all the time then."
But here was the deal.
About 5 or 6 days per year -- Allentown was not 3rd in PA population.
And here is why not.
Allentown had about 106,000 people for about 360 days per year.
And on those same 360 days -- State College PA had about 42,000.
But when Penn State had their home games -- State College became the 3rd largest city in Pennsylvania --
W: "Before the Pandemic, EAA in Oshkosh would get a million people here."
because Beaver Stadium seats 106,000 spectators !!
Both: "Wow!"
Yep.   You are right Wolf.
But still popul8ion counts probably shouldn't really include temporary visitors who are merely fans of a local sports team. Seems like Allentown's 3rd place popul8ion-wise should be persistent to me.
1 Milwaukee 594,548
2 Madison     254,977
But -- during EAA -- Oshkosh become Number One !!
Popul8ion figures normally indic8 residents, not merely tourists.
Well Pip -- in this Century -- this cute little statistic is no longer.
Because Beaver Stadium is still only 106,000 --
and Allentown is now just slightly over 120,000.
Yes.   Yes.   Ok.   Of course (technically) you are correct.
      But I thought it was a cute statistic when I heard it.
I'm sorry.
                       I did not mean to offend the actualarial experts in the crowd here.
It *is* a curious and cute statistic though to note when local events draw large enough numbers of out-of-towners to indic8 that temporary adjustment of numbers of people within certain cities causes a re-ordering of the top ones. I'm not offended.  üòä
Hehe. Sorry PedantPip can be an actuarial expert sometimes.
/actualarial/  /actuarial/
Thank you for correcting my sppeling.
üòä
You're welcome.
Wolf: "You're such an interesting person. I can't w8 to meet you."
Well Wolf -- as I've said before  :::
RUBY & THE ROMANTICS - Our Day Will Come

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw9RVjEN9OI
Wolf: "That will be very good. Can't w8.  üòä
"
Both: "We're listening to the song now."
Wolf: "Oh, I know that song! Hmm hmm."
Of course you do Wolf.
But Pip probably doesn't.
Correct.
         Well -- he does now !!
You're welcome Pip.
üòä
Getting introduced to it. Thanks!  üòä
wLcome.
Wolf: "I had that record... with Frankie Avalon and all of them."
Wolf: "My Mom had Winchester Cathedral, the Brass Band."
Well Dad, is anything on your PCA for tonight?
I love music Wolf.
Wolf: "So do I. I love all kinds of music."
Even got paid for playing records for about 25 years --
Pip: "I love music much too."
Wolf: "Awesome! I met Wolf-Man Jack once."
     as a disc jockey on about a dozen radio stations around the country.
He (Wolf-Man) was one of the greats -- and a really nice guy too.
Wolf: "Yes, he was."
Where did you meet him ?
Wolf: "I won a contest in Orlando, Florida to meet him. I can talk like him somewhat. I have the (*deep* gritty) 'voice to say it'.  üòä
"
lol
I'll look forward to hearing you do that Wolf.
Wolf: "And his old saying: 'Yeah, baby! Howooohl!'."
When I lived in Southeast Hollywood -- in the late 60s -- the station that Wolf-Man worked at was just 4 blocks from where I (and Dottie) were living.
Wolf: "Ah, that's cool."
Wolf: "Do you know the GrassRoots? Barbie's step-Dad married the lead-singer of them. I met him a couple times. He sang at a restaurant Barb and I stayed at. The band was there."
Wolf: "I don't remember his name... but he was 20 Years older than his wife."

American Graffiti (9/10) Movie CLIP - Wolfman Jack (1973) HD
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99z-H_NEccU
Wolf: "Yep. That's a young picture of him."
There is a 3:28 clip from the movie he was in.
Wolf: "They played a lot of the Beach Boys' music."
Wolf: "I didn't know he was in a movie."
Both: "We're watching that clip now."
Both: "Very cool clip. Yeah!  üòä
"
I am very aware of the Grass Roots.
Wolf: "I remember watching 'Sha-na-na' on the TV back when they came on, with Bowser. He was my favorite."
I was the Quality Control Supervisor at the Los Angeles record pressing plant that manufactured all of their records for all of the states west of the Mississippi.
But -- I'm confused.
Did you say:  "Barbie's step-Dad married the lead-singer of The Grass Roots" ?
All of their vocalists were guys.
What am I missing here ?
Wolf: "Ah, woops. Barbie's step-Dad's daughter married the lead-singer."
Ah ha.
*daughter*
Yeah.
Now we're on the same page.
Thank you Wolf.
üòä
Wolf: "Dennis Heinz was Barbie's step-Dad's name. Same as the ketchup, but not rel8d."
Wolf: "Very good.  üòä
"
I don't remember Dennis being in The Grass Roots.
Wolf: "No, his daughter married the lead-singer."
Wolf: "He was a supervisor of making fire-place mantles in Oshkosh."
Lead-singer of what group ?
GrassRoots.
I'm still confused.    Help ?
Dennis' *daughter* married the lead-singer of GrassRoots.
Dennis was Barbie's step-Dad. His *daughter* married the lead-singer.
Ah-ha.
Thank you.
Now you've set my head on straight.
Wolf: "Glad I could help."
Well maybe it's about time we could wrap things up for tonight and maybe plan to chat again next Friday evening?
Excuse me -- be back shortly.
Or maybe Sunday evening, if you have more you'd like to try to get into before Friday?
Okay, we'll w8.
Had to visit the P-room.
I'm back now.
Wolf just had to go right now too.
Ok -- well when He gets back let me know please.
He's back.
Wolf: "My Grandma had the big player with the horn on it with the big cylindrical discs with tubes before records."
Well I think I'm about ready to run Wolf home soon. Can we plan on chatting more again either Sunday or next Friday evening please?
Yes Wolf.   I never had that record player -- but saw it in a museum.
My first record player was a used one that I got around 1948 -- but I'll save that story for another time.
Do we have time to finish this thing up with Wolf here.
I had a couple more questions -- or did you want to suspend us right now ?
Okay. We can handle a couple more questions now.
Good.
Thank you.
Let me get my facts straight.
Be right back.
Well let's just suspend for tonight then, and just shoot again for Sunday or next Friday night for more. I'm running out of steam for typing.
I'm going to drive him home. Let me know when you'd like to plan to chat again next. I'll check it when I get back.
Wolf: "Goodbye.  üòä
  üòä
"
Good night guys.
Thank you both.
Much ‚ù§

You're welcome. Thank you too. I ‚ù§

Shabbat Shalom Dad.
Wolf is here beside me. We should be ready to chat whenever you are. I sent you an e-mail a few hours ago regarding our recent videos, which hopefully you can watch and respond about whenever you get a chance.
Since it looks like you're not online yet, I may run to the kitchen for a few minutes and be back shortly to see if you might be ready to chat then. Wolf will still be here in the room watching the chat window, if you might want to type anything to him to read and think about until I return. Feel free.
Back and ready whenever.

Good Evening Philip.
So sorry mon ami.
I've been here for 19 minutes
-- but I couldn't get Gmail to load.
That's okay. Hopefully you will get a better setup soon. Any news on Terra repairs?
Good evening Wolf.
              Glad to see you again.
Wolf: "Oh. All right!  üòä
"
üòä
Ah yes.
     I see your smiling face too.
Oh -- Tera.
     Lonng story.
          More on that soon.
Ah. Did I misspell it with two R's but it should have only one? I've forgotten.
Just "Tera" and "Sammi"?
It's ookk.
I kneww what you meant.
"terra" means "land".
     "tera" means "1,000,000,000,000".
-- as in "one-trillion".
So gentlemen --
Right on. I think we have time for the long story about Tera, if you'd like to explain now?
     how were your weeks ?
     sniff, sniff                -- I don't want to talk about it.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
Wolf: "Pip just showed me pictures of you and you're just like I thought you'd be. You look just like each other.  üòä
"
Okay, we can talk about Tera l8r, whenever you're ready.
Actually -- we don't really Wolf.
     Pip still has hair !!
üòä
Wolf: "Aaamm, I think so."
Ok.
You're de boss.
W: "Hahahaha...  üòä
"
Ah -- I now see your 1700 G / 1600 P Gmail about the Video #2.
Thank you.
Did you wish I should watch it now --
     or in April ?
It's about all 5 videos that are up now. Probably 4 of them are ones you haven't watched yet.
Five ?!
I wish you would please watch one of the ones you haven't seen yet, then come back to chat just about it.
                     interrobang
5 total, 4 probably new to you.
Ok.   I can do that.
I see 5 links.
One of them is like 41 minutes long, so that might be a poor choice, unless you're sure you want to spend that long watching right now.
Which one should I watch first ?
Probably pick any of the other 3 to watch first, then return to chat.
Appoint one to me please.

Ok.   "LQ" looks like 19:53 (Your Uncle Mike's year-of-SSA).
Is that the one I am assigned to watch now ?
Yes, please.
Uncle Mike was your brother? ... also... What does "SSA" stand for again? I primarily assoC8 that with "SocialSecurityAdministr8ion" but your confusing assumption that it's recognizable and comprehensible was "SkinSuit... " something... like Abandonment or what again?
Ah... "Arrival" for birth? I was thinking it was death, but didn't see what the dur8ion made without the colon between the minutes and seconds indic8d as Year. Seeing 1953 as a Year clarified that you mean birth with SSA, not death.
Hmm.  More Gmail connection problems.
Wolf: "I'm sorry if I said anything in the video that you might be offended by."
Bummer.
     Sorry.
Hopefully you can resolve soon... but take your time. We're here and shouldn't have to go anywhere.
Yes -- Michael is my brother.   Actually -- you (Pip & Wolf) are my brothers too.
But Michael is a bio-brother.
That is -- a "close" bio-brother.
Wolf: "Haha. Thank you very much. I'm glad someone thinks of me that way.  üòä
"
Cool.
You are both bio-brothers too.
But you (Wolf) are not as close (bio) as is Pip.
Mike's SSA was in December of 1953.
Mike's SSS was in December of 2005 -- if I'm remembering correctly.
Wolf: "He was 5 Years older than me. I was born in 1958."
This is correct Wolf.
     I remember the day of your SSA.
Do you remember the precise d8s of Uncle Mike's SSA and SSS? I'd like to make a note of them please.
Yes -- I can give then to you.
But we are getting loaded up with assignments for me here.
(1)   watch LQ
Any order is fine.
(2)   day Wolf was advented into the air
(3)   Uncle Mike's stats
Which am I assigned to do first please ?
Command me please.
September 5th 1958, around 8AM was Wolf's BirthDay (SSA).
Then please find (if you have to), and provide Uncle Mike's d8s... then watch the PedantPip and WildWolf video.
September 5th 1958 was a Friday.
1958 was the year that Elvis went into the Army.
March 24, 1958.
That was a Monday.
Wolf: "My Dad was in the Army. He was in Colonel Patton's infantry, tank division: 'Hell on Wheels!' it was called. My Dad was in the movie about Patton too."
Your SSA was 22,792 days ago Wolf.
The average SSE (skinsuit expectancy) is about 30,000 days.
SSA means SkinSuit Advent (or Arrival) into the air of the Earth.
SSS means SkinSuit Surrendered.
Yep.   That is also correct Wolf.
     I knew that about your Dad.
üòä
Thank you.
Your birthday (this year) will be on a Sunday, Wolf.
My SSA was a Sunday.
Pip's SSA was a Monday.
W: "Yes."
Angie = Thursday.
Tim = Wednesday.
Your birthday is 219 days away, Wolf.
In 1958 the most popular baby names were:   Michael & Susan.
Michael is the name of my bio-brother.
Susan is the name of my bio-cousin.
Susie was also SSA'd in 1943 -- as was I.
She is my elder by 6¬Ω months.
Hey Dad. Friend just called and said we have to go pick up from nearby gas-st8ion. We've gotta run out for maybe half an hour. Please watch the other videos and take notes. We should be back here pretty soon, and will message again once we're back. We'll try to make it quick.
Don't make it "quick".
     Axiom #27.
I'll be here.
You've given me plenty of assignments to work on while you're gone.
     I'm a happy man.
Have a good time.
See you in a little while.

The word "cousin" was derived from "co-son".
Son means "proof".
A "son" is a "proof" of her (or his) parents ==
-- and grandparents -- and all the ggg-grandparents before in the chain.
A "co-son" (cousin) is a "co-proof" of all one's lineage too.
"co-proof" meaning "an also-proof".
You are a son (proof) of your father and mother.
H'ever -- your (1st) cousins are also-proofs of your (and their) grandparents.
And that is the "origi-story" on "cousin".

Well -- my friend.
I've been "working" on your LQ video for nearly 1¬Ω hours now --
Cool.
and I'm only up to 10:40 of the 19:53 of it.
That's fine.
Want to just discuss the first half of it?
I was commanded to take notes.
Which I did.
Tons (so far) !!
Please feel free to share them, or whatever else your opinions and perspectives on what you've digested so far are.
Thank you.
Although I have no idea what comes after the 10:40 --
I would say that this one is Xcellent.
Good job gentlemen.
Thanks!
You're welcome.
What about it makes you consider it "Xcellent"?
I'll get to that in a moment.
Okay.
 
First, Wolf -- I wish to make a comment on your
"hope" (earlier) -- that you "hoped" that nothing
you said "offended" me.  ‚Ä¢  I do not become
"offended" easily.  So -- be not concerned about
that.  But -- thank you for the sentiment.  I know
that you are a kind man -- and your basic approach
to conversing with others is soft and courteous at
all times.  You are a nice man -- and thoughtful --
and well-spoken -- all of which I respect greatly.
 
So -- offended "no" (am I). --- H'ever.  This
does not mean that we agree on everything.  As
Pip well knows -- I (also) love and respect him
magnanimously -- but I disagree with him on many
things.  This (disagreement) then -- becomes the
fodder for some of our most interesting discussions
-- and I learn so much from him through them.
 
You (also) are in the very same basket -- and
I thank My Father for having sent you to teach me.
Wolf: "Very nice! I'm very pleased."
 
(//)
Wolf: "Ah. Cool!"
Good.
Me too.
Someone is typing.    I w8.
Wolf took an IQ test today and was surprised and pleased with the results. He did better than he thought he would. He's been told he was "dumb" almost his whole life. He scored a 96 (slightly below average) today. His actual score likely should have been much higher for at least 2 reasons though.
He answered almost every question right away. He had an average of 1 minute available to ponder each question before giving an answer, but he answered most questions within 2 to 16 seconds. The whole test had to be completed within 20 minutes, but he finished in just 5 minutes (since he didn't quite understand that he had much more time available to consider possible answers much more carefully than he did).
The second critical reason is that he skipped 3 out of the 20 questions, but then could not return to them after the last one had been answered, in order to provide answers for those ones too. The next time he takes such a test, he'll probably be able to answer all 20 str8 away (without skipping any), or instead will know to return to the skipped ones before answering the last one. I'm expecting his next test to result in a score probably somewhere between 115 and 125. I'm pretty sure he's significantly above average. We'll see. He's proud, as he should be.  üòä
Wolf: "Wow. That's the nicest thing anyone ever said about me.  üòä
"
Ok.   Now it's my turn ?
??
Yep. Go ahead.
Thank you.
I shall make a few comments on this IQ thing.
And then will open for comments and/or questions.
I don't know which IQ test you took -- but it was not a good one.
The most well-known one is the "Stanford-Binet" IQ test --
which does not attempt to "score" the applicant within
a mere 20 minutes.
I give my own "IQ" tests -- but rarely share the results with anyone.
Here are some notes on that.
Pip has an "above average" (101+) IQ.
His is not as high as Angie's.
Wrong!
My IQ is significantly higher than Angie's.
But he is showing signs of approaching her level.
Quiet please.
You don't know the two of us well enough to understand how and why yet, but someday you will.
It is still "my turn".
I reiterate:
Pip's is not as high as Angie's.
But he is showing signs of approaching her level.
Now.
Why do I say that.
?
Because -- one's IQ is not static.
It fluctuated over the course of one's lifetime --
and this is primarily due to the spirit of that person.
Now.
Pip & Angie aside.
Let's get to Wolf.
I have known you for a number of months.
I have not set a "Stanford-Binet" on your desk.
And have not asked you to write out this & that.
But I can tell you this:
96 is not correct.
Now.
I said that one's IQ fluctuates over the years.
What causes it to rise ?
Flat out (and simply):
           one thing.
Curiosity.
If you ask questions --
you escalate your intelligence.
Most people have a nice IQ for their first 10 to 12
years of breathing. 
For the next 8 to 10 years -- some rise.
And some fall.
But then -- after the age of about 20 -- most
tend to begin to decline.
This need not be a permanent path.
But often it is.
Some people (later in life) become re-interested
in increasing their intelligence.
It may happen at 42.
Or -- for some -- around 62.
Now --
I have one question for you Wolf.
And then I shall open for comments and/or questions from either of you.
Wolf:
     Why the recent interest in "finding out" what your IQ may happen to be ?
Wolf: "Because I was told all my life that I was stupid. I didn't know anything. This was my chance to find out."
Wolf: "I didn't have the opportunity to go to school a lot. We moved every Year as a kid. I learned almost everything just in the wild, by myself. I stopped school in 9th grade."
I am stupid.
And that is the only person authorized to make that judgment.
Me.
If I say I am stupid -- then that settles it.
             I am.
I am my ultimate (and always) judge.
W: "OK."
üòä
I ‚ù§
 you Wolf.
W: "Haha. I ‚ù§
you too."
Thank you Wolf.
W: "That makes my heart-strings sing.  üòä
"
             Good for you.
Dancing is good exercise.
      It unfolds our soul.
W: "Yes."
I never finished my comments on when you SSA'd Wolf.
Here is one more thing:
What song.
Beethoven's FurElise!
What song was #1 in America -- on the day of your SSA ?
W: "I don't remember."
Rarely does a song in a foreign language make it --
to the top of the charts.   But on the day of your SSA --
this was not the case.









































Overview
Sorry
Having Gchat troubles again.
"Nel blu dipinto di blu" was the #1 song in America on Sep 5 1958.
It was sung by Domenico Modugno.
It means "in the blue painted blue".
What does that mean ?
     I have no idea.
üòä
It comes from the Italian.
The song was also alternately entitled: "Volare".
     -- which means "to fly".
And (I believe) this was a message to you Wolf.
Your "birthday song" was to suggest your destiny to you, Wolf.
Pip:  Birthday song:    Tonight's The Night.
Mon Dec 13 1976.
An interesting note on the artist who recorded that song.
Your Dad's first (given) name is "Gerard" --
even though he is customarily called "Gerry".
Another (occasional) nickname for "Gerard" is "Rod".
Why is this ?
Some might say that this is because the "rard" part of the name sound somewhat like "rod".
This may (or may not) be the reason -- but if --
we look into the actual meaning of the word "gerard" --
we find that it actually means "mighty-spear".
The "ger" is like unto "gore" (a spear).
The "ard" is an abbreviation of "hard" (mighty).
So -- the nickname "Rod" is about a "spear".
Anyway.
Who sang "Tonight's The Night" ?
           Rod    Steward
See the connection to your Dad's name ?
üòä
Yep.
Whoops.
Sorry.
Rod Stewart.
Angie -- "With A Little Luck" -- Paul McCartney & Wings -- Thu Jun 1 1978.
Tim -- "Upside Down" -- Diana Ross -- Wed Sep 30 1980.
W: "Ah. Cool."
W: "Got'cha. My birth-stone is Blue Sapphire."
Ah so.
And this means what to you ?
W: "I love blue... like the Italian song title had in it."
Xcellent Wolf.
Piece of Light 5b.
          There are no accidents in my universe.
Oh.
Correction.
I said Tim's SSA was a Wednesday.
W: "I don't believe in accidents either. I believe in f8."
     Wrong.
Sep 30 1980 was a Tuesday.
Sorry.
Define f8 please Wolf.
W: "Umm... *sigh* ... Everything has a reason, and a reason of being... and I live on a path that is made for me. It's a path you walk, the for the first time, and when you run into people, it's meant to be. I have no other way of saying it. My path led to Pip, and I am very happy."
So we're kinda winding down here, and I'm about ready to run Wolf home. Maybe we can plan to chat more again Monday night together?
Maybe you could watch all the videos and note whatever your thoughts are about all of them before then.
Monday (Feb 1st) sounds doable.
One more item now ?
Puedo ?
Yes. Go ahead.
Good.
Thank you.
You asked for stats on Uncle Mike.
 
Michael Arthur Stuart
   SSA: Sun Dec 27 1953 
   SSS: Fri Dec 02 2005
   AGE: 51.9
(//)
Mike was SSA'd on a Sunday at 2029.
Your Dad was SSA'd on a Sunday at 2030.
Thanks! Why did he die at 51.9 Years-old?
He did not die.
He merely surrendered his skinsuit.
Of course -- you actually meant:  cause of breathing cessation.
And -- I'm not sure that I know that.
Diane (his wife) would probably be able to answer that one.
I have her address -- if you want it.
Thank you for this nice chat -- Wolf & Pip.
That's okay. I was just curious if you already knew.
I appreciate it.
You're welcome Dad. We've enjoyed it too.
I ‚ù§

I love you too Dad.
W: "I'm getting to know you, and I love you like a brother... and that means something.  üòä
"
Thank you Pip.
üòä
Thank you Wolf.
Yes -- we are brothers.
But --
you are also my son.
W: "Thank you."
Enjoy the rest of the videos and hopefully we can all reconvene Monday night, Feb. 1st 2021 around 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime.
You're welcome.
But -- you "signed off" on it too.
Sound like a plan.
Thank you                               all.

Happy GroundHog's Day Dad.  üòä
üòä
First of all:
 
I have no excuse for my failure
to show up last evening.
 
My only request is:
Please forgive me.
 
(//)
You're forgiven
.
Thank you.
 
Shall we do the weather next ?
Sure.
Ok.
Here goes.
Yes -- Pennsylvania had quite a substantial
snowfall over the past few days.
We got about 4 inches on Sunday (Jan 31).
And then after a short break -- a "second
round" of the white stuff on Monday (Feb 1).
 
This map was given to us after "The First Wave"
-- to suggest what might be added to
the original 4 inches.
By the end of Monday February 1 2021 -- we had
gotten about another 10 inches -- making the
grand total in the general range of 14 inches.
 
Did you get any of it in Oshkosh ?
Little so far. Probably about 4 to 8 inches expected tonight and tomorrow, it sounds like from what Wolf just indic8d, over the phone.
Ah ha.   He is not there with you tonight ?
No, he isn't. We had planned to hang out this AfterNoon tent8ively, but I have been in a bad mood and needed some sleep, so we re-scheduled to hang hopefully tomorrow, maybe a better day instead.
Ok.
So -- want to share any of your last 91 hours
-- and/or your bad mood stuff ?
Hmm. Thinking. Are you sure you want me to?
lol
Well -- now that you ask that --
     I'm not sure.
üòä
But yes -- if you would like to --
     I would like to hear it.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks Dad. I ‚ù§
you too.
Thank you Pip.
Umm, I have enjoyed a pretty nice WeekEnd and MonDay, hanging with Wolf and watching a bunch of gr8 YouTube videos mostly and discussing them. Several excellent ones by a newly discovered and subscribed to channel by Dr. Becky, probably a brilliant AstroPhysicist, who is super-smart, and very pretty and sharp, and playful too.
Good.
     I believe I see a "non-bad" mood there.
          That's nice.
Thank you for the link you sent me last evening.

I could not get it to come up on IE.
But I went over to Chrome -- and it loaded just fine there.
I have not watched the whole thing yet.
But -- began it.
Thank you.
Your turn again.
Ah. Hmm. Thinking.
Had to get some juice from the fridge.
Ok.   Now you have me "thinking" about juice.
üòä
I guess today was rough because I've had many visions of widespread death and judgment (maybe hopefully mostly justified though)... and destruction, devast8ion, widespread grief, agony, and panic.
Dark stuff, bloody battles, strewn bodies around. Hopefully avoidable. Not sure if it will be. Might be prescient or vivid premonition.
So -- what's that all about Pip.
Just judgment.
Judgment because of ?
Evil.
I do not deny that evil exists -- but
I do not care to focus on it.
For -- what I dwell on -- expands.
I prefer to focus on loving thoughts.
      And thereby -- love abounds.
Yes ?                                  No ?
Are you mulling ?
         Or -- just busy with your juice again ?
Sorry. Yeah, busy getting the juice bottle to bring into my computer room... and now thinking...
Judgment because of maybe mainly thoughtlessness, widespread.
üòä
I don't think focusing on loving thoughts necessarily causes love to abound. It might, but probably doesn't always do so.
Are you a thoughtless person ?
     I don't think so.
So then -- you -- just by being you --
diminish the widespreadness of thoughtlessness
in the world.     Don't you ?
No. It abounds in most other people, despite it often diminishing within me. I am anomalous.
Does it abound in me ?
Unfortun8ly, I must say: "Yes. There's too much thoughtlessness (from my perspective) in you for me to deal with sometimes."
Interesting.
Tell me more please.
I sometimes challenge your purported opinions or so-called wisdom, especially f8h and Christian beliefs, beyond just lame Axioms and Pieces-of-"Light". You scarcely contend with any direct critiques.
It seems you're too thoughtless, too brainwashed, indoctrin8d, etc. and I wish you could speak, on the phone, over video-chat somehow someDay. We'll see. Maybe you can pray. Whatever. That's not for me. I have a different trajectory.
Trajectory ?
My path.
My aim.
My targets.
Tell me about your path please.
Where does it go ?
What is your desire ?
My path scarcely (if ever) includes prayer anymore... is what I was saying.
That's fine.
What *does* it include ?
I don't know where my path goes, but may well lead to becoming judge, authority, philosopher && warrior, gr8 King over this world. I desire this somewhat too.
I'd like to hear more about your Kingdom please.
     I shall be living in it.
          What will it be like ?
Hopefully my path includes reloc8ing to Los Angeles again this Year, or next (if infeasible through 2021).
I've got that.
And (as you know) -- I fully support that.
But what about your Kingdom ?
What will it be like ?
What my Kingdom will be like should depend gr8ly on which of a bewildering array of routes it comes about. Everything that happens between here and there may impact what it will be like, at least somewhat.
s/about/about through/;
Well -- your Kingdom will be designed by you --
but I (as one of your subjects) shall live within it.
What will change in my life --
because of the "ways" of your Kingdom ?
I'm not sure. Can you please try to ask more specific questions about what I most have in mind for my Kingdom? The overly general: "What will change for me?" is not specific enough to answer well at the moment.
Hmm.
Will I like living in your Kingdom ?
Or -- will I (mostly) dislike it ?
It gr8ly depends on how well we rel8 between now and then. Could go either way.
You probably won't like major parts of it, as well as many of the things I may have had to do to establish it.
Do we relate well now ?
Today ?
Sometimes.
Somewhat.
At this moment ?
Fine for now.
What do you expect you will have to do to establish your Kingdom ?
There's a somewhat distant possibility that I will need to kill maybe many enemies and assassins. Hopefully won't need to though. We'll see.
Will I be among them ?
Hopefully not.
Among those that require killing ?
You say "hopefully not".
What might I do that would make me be one who "needs to be exterminated" ?
Try obviously and seriously to assassin8 me.
Or try hard to sacrifice, crucify, expend, etc. me.
How many times (in the past) have I tried to do that ?
I'm not sure. Hopefully few, if any.
Well think on this please.
If there has been one -- should I not need
to know about it -- and be given an
attitude adjustment / a teaching / a correction
of my ways / my thinking ?
Possibly. Sometimes re-educ8ion seems to be an opportunity to reform old unacceptable behavior... but sometimes things must be dealt with quickly and harshly. Peaceful and gentle ought to be strongly preferred, but sometime can't be afforded as much as might be hoped for or intended.
What needs to be reformed in me ?
     That I might (better) be fit to live in your Kingdom ?
Probably reform8ion will be needed, for your beliefs... in eternity, infinity, the always, the never, the absolutes of illogic and incompatibility with observable life as we know it.
Leaving those behind and embracing the finite, the measurable, the discrete... should be a big step in the right direction, if you're serious about prepR8ion, for my Kingdom that's coming and maybe cumming in ways too.
You've lost me here (a little).
I think I need more specifics.
Are you saying that I need to change some of my beliefs ?
And -- if yes -- which ones ?
     Well -- let's start with one.
Which belief do I need to change first --
in order to fit better into your Kingdom ?
Deny that eternal existence qualifies to being called "life". Eternity is infinite, and thus unattainable, not achievable. Forget it. Anything that's supposedly "forever" is not a good thought.
GOP
Accept finitude. Long life may be good. "Living" forever would not be.
Do you wish to have an "end" ?
I do.
Well -- for me -- that stinks !
If you are a good and wise King -- it is my
desire -- that your be my King forever.
Is not this a standard saying of all the subjects of every kingdom ?
Well maybe I can be "forever" King as far as you're concerned, or will know, as long as you simply die before I do.
                  "Oh -- live forever -- our King!"
It might be a standard saying. Many people think finite life "stinks" and that they'll inherit some eternal one somehow. That's stupid though. Life is finite. It ends. Life dies. We should come to terms with the truth.
I'm aware that "kings" don't need to be "voted"
into office.  But -- you get my vote / endorsement.
I believe you will make an Xcellent King.
Thanks. Nice to know.
But -- come to think of it -- I see a *big* problem.
I may. I may not. I'll try to be an excellent King though, if I become one. We may see ahead.
Isn't your becoming The King -- predicated on the death of your Father ?
Don't I have to die -- before you can become The King ?
I don't think it must be that way. There should be plenty of ways that allow you to live.
GOP
To be a trusted advisor to the King could be a primary role of yours, even remaining also a citizen, civilian, serf, subject of the Kingdom.
How could I possibly be a "trusted advisor" ?
I believe in forever.
You might also be treated approprE8ly as royalty. A sort of ex-King honorarily, implied by our rel8ionship, and my throne.
You cannot *trust* that !!
You may not hold belief in forever forever.  üòâ
I can trust those who believe in forever somewhat, but it will probably dwindle over time.
A king cannot get inside the head of his subjects.
Nor can any person do that.
Oh yes I can, one way or another!
GOP
Literally or figur8ively. It's possible to get in people's heads. Not always pretty, but feasible.
Ok.
You got me there.
Hmm.
I do not detect that "bad mood" you had talked about a while back.
Do you still say that you have it ?
I'm in a somewhat better mood now.
Whoopie !!!
                                 I'm a happy Dad.
üòä
See my face ?
Yep.
You happy make me.
         You are a "happy-making" King.
              We ‚ù§
 you.
We hope that you are our King forever.
Oh.     Sorry.     That's not possible.
I do not intend to reign forever. Maybe just a long time.
Why should you ever step down ?
Another might prove to be better able to rule.
Is Tim going to succeed you ?
Maybe.
          Or Angie ?
Probably not her.
No -- not Angie.
       She will not take care of the kittens in the Kingdom very well.
Will Tim allow kittens in the Kingdom ?
He should. Cats are mostly gr8.
     Or -- will he require them to remain "outside the walls" ?
Sounds like a person opin to me.
I heard that Tim and Mandy are puppy persons.
     What have you heard ?
Little to nothing. They don't give a shit about me anymore. Not in touch. Don't care to be.
Both cats and dogs will be mostly welcome in my Kingdom Cum.
Changes are coming Pip.
Mandy is not happy with the situation between you and Tim.
She holds family ties to be an important thing.
She is just (mostly) quiet about it -- for now.
But --                               changes are coming Pip.
                        ‚ù§
                    is coming !!
Probably you're right.
At least about changes, even if not ‚ù§
.
                               Ye say well -- oh King.
I *am*.
First (and foremost) about ‚ù§
 .
Secondly -- about changes.
Any changes -- which are not born of ‚ù§
 -- are not good changes.
                You can carve that into the mantles of your porticos.
(//)
I won't. I don't agree. Many changes I would consider to be good should be born out of all sorts of better things than love. Love scarcely matters to me anymore. I've had enough of it. Hardly want it any longer. I probably won't need much love, if any, ahead.

Cool d8 just passed. Wanted to note it.
Yes -- I see it.  --   It says:   Love too to Love Love Love Love Love.
I'm glad you saw it important enough to make a "printed" note of it !!

Listen to this: "Long Live Literacy Lord Lion!"
Is it my imagination -- or -- has it been quiet in here for about 12 minutes ?
Do you have anything on your PCA?
Nothing hot.
I'm tired and winding down, nodding off. Need sleep soon.
How about you ?
Well -- thank you for tonight.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
     I found it very interesting.

Hello Dad. Wolf is with me here again. How are you tonight?
Shabbat Shalom Gentlemen.
Good evening Wolf.
Is that Pip there beside you ?
Wolf: "Glad to be here to talk to you again."
I am doing better.
Thank you for asking.
How are you ?
Glad to hear it. You're welcome.
     And you ?
I am quite good, thanks.
Wolf: "I'm doing fantastic. Had a beautiful day yesterday, shoveling snow."
Ah ha.
W: "Wore a blister on my thumb."
     You got some snow ?
          It must be Christmas again -- yes ?
Over the past 24 hours or so, yeah, we got about 6-inches of snowfall.
Well -- the snow is good.
I don't think I'd say it was "Christmas" again, but I guess you might.
     The blister is                                ouch !!
It froze my car-door shut. Rather frustr8ing, but it happens.
How much snow has Reading, Pennsylvania received throughout the past week?
Well -- that's good.
Reading ?
Wolf: "Blisters are like a badge-of-honor to me. I like to do it."
4 inches on Sun Jan 31.
W: "Means I'm working hard."
10 inches on Mon Feb 1.
Total ... uh ...  I'm thinking ...
4 plus 10  ...  ...  ...  
          uh -- I'm not sure.
That's okay.
Does anyone have a calculator ?
We've got an idea that it's already a good deal more than we've seen over the same time-frame.
Good enough.
W: "Now we're falling into the sub-zeroes... and I love it."
I'm not nearly so pleased with sub-zero temper8ures, but will hopefully cope with them okay.
W: "I can walk around in T-shirts and shorts in that kind of weather."
Rather you than me Wolf.
W: "Hahahaha! Funny... funny.  üòä
"
I visited Wisconsin once.
July.
I didn't mind the cold weather there at that time.
But -- I when home in August.
     It was starting to get a little too chilly for me.
üòä
W: "I could live in Alaska and love it."
/when/  /went/
Have you ever been to Alaska ?
Were you here in Wisconsin during some July for E.A.A. in Oshkosh, or somewhere else for something else?
I haven't. Wolf hasn't yet either.
Nope.   Not E.A.A.   Went through Wisconsin on
my way to Grand Forks, North Dakota.
My Uncle Thurman was living there then.
W: "North Dakota is beautiful. Been there a few times hitch-hiking. I like the 'BadLands'."
I spent about half of that summer at his home.
I believe it was 1958.
Just about a month before your SSA, Wolf.
Wolf: "The Year I was born! Must've been a good Year."
It was a spectacular year.
W: "That's why my Dad named me: 'Kenneth' meaning 'Handsome'."
That March was also "The Blizzard of The Century" in Pennsylvania.
I did a bit of show snoveling that winter too.
Hmm.
          "show snoveling" ?
Is that right ?
Hmm.
üòä
Spoonerisms are gr8.
Yep.   I ‚ù§
 'em.
üòä
Reverend Spooner was a fun guy to sit under.
And -- he didn't do them on purpose.
But I do.
They're phun !!
I ‚ù§
them much of the time, but am somewhat growingly concerned that they may do some harm to language among the general average popul8ion of people who aren't well-versed with the nuances of language, etymologies, and correct versus crE8ive (mis-?)spellings.
When I was a radio announcer -- I enjoyed doing the weather reports in the winter.
I told my listeners when to expect flow snurries.
You're right.
I find that the vast majority of people tend to terminate their study of language in their early 20s.
It's sad.
You're right.
Wolf: "I'm still working on it... and improving."
Good for you Wolf.

One of the fE8ures of Octology which I suspect you'll appreC8 is the wrapping of the local dictionary d8a-base look-ups with a d8-stamped log of the query history so that it becomes quite convenient to review (and include comments regarding) what you have been learning for vocabulary. A very useful ability and upgrade wrapping the default behavior. My code also re-formats and dynamically colorizes the typically just plain-text output. Hopefully you'll be able to run and enjoy this code someday soon.
Wolf: "I would like to hear one of your Axioms or Pieces-of-Light when you can describe one, so that I can go home and think about it tonight."
Well -- you need not to ask me Wolf.
Pip has all 29 of the Pieces-of-Light -- and about half of the Axioms too.
True.
Wolf: "I thought you might have something new to say about any of them... because I'm very interested."
He may not be able to expatiate on every one of then to the extreme lengths that I sometimes do -- but he knows quite a bit about many of them.
Before he heads home, probably after we're done chatting, I'll be glad to review what I have on your Axioms and Pieces-of-Light.
And then -- beyond that -- I am available for questions -- when anyone wishes to dig deeper.
At our Seminars -- I frequently do about a 10-minute Lesson -- on any one of the 56 snippets -- when someone asks for it.
Sounds good. If Wolf comes up with any questions that I can't clearly answer already, we plan to make notes of any such quandaries, so that we can pose them to you the next opportunity we have to all chat together. Wolf wants you to know that he already mostly agrees with what he has heard so far from your material.
Noted.   Thank you.
So Dad, have you engaged with your Father at all this past week regarding no longer adhering to "eternity" as anything that can even conceptually be good or acceptable for what seems increasingly likely to become something like a fundamental tenet of my eventual Kingdom? Just curious.
What is your definition of "eternity" ?
"Eternity" is unlimited time, or something lasting forever, without any end. I don't believe this is (or can be) a good concept. Long periods of time for things may prove to be just fine, but for anything to persist without any end ever, is probably a very bad thing for life (as far as I can tell, so far).
Wolf: "I believe living forever is passing your genes on to future gener8ions. I can't do that though, so I'd like to pass on my DNA."
Hmm.
                   I'm thinking.
And how might you plan to do that Wolf ?
And Pip -- thank you for your answer.
Wolf: "Through my blood-line."
You're welcome.
I'm going to run to get us drinks and me some candy from the fridge. Be right back...
Bring me a beverage too please.
     I'll skip the candy for now.
üòä
Heh. Back. What might you prefer to drink?  üòâ
Through your blood-line Wolf ?          
Tell me more please.
Wolf: "Hmm. I'm not quite sure. I'll leave that up to science."
What do I have to pick from (beverages) ?
Ok.   Thank you Wolf.
Cherry cola, Citrus Drop soda, Cran-Mango juice, Fiji water, milk, or I could brew any of 7 flavors of coffee... oh and also have a few flavors of fine teas too. Many options. You've probably gotta get yourself here though, to partake of them.
Well (of course) -- that's a no-brainer !!
     What brand is your cherry cola ?
Generic Kroger's "Big-K" brand.
     Hmm.
Only 89-cents per 2-liter bottle. Quite a value!
Ok.   I'll try it.
Wolf: "I like to buy big bottles of Cranberry juice."
Kroger is the largest grocery store in America.
I'll w8 to pour it until you arrive. It'll probably go flat if poured now, in anticip8ion of your eventual arrival.  üòâ
Possibly in the world.
      But I don't know that for sure.
My study was only for America.
Wolf just suggested that probably WalMart is even larger.
Walmart is the largest retailer in America.
And that is extreme !!
They move a lot of grocery items too.
Walmart's revenue is 2¬Ω times that of the #2 Retailer in America.
However -- only a small part of Walmart's income is from foodstuffs.
That is why Kroger is the #1 grocery outlet in America.
Wolf: "Ah. Okay. Understood."
I have never had Kroger's cherry cola.
So I cannot pass judgment on it yet.
However -- I *have* had a number of different brands of cherry cola.
Wolf: "I'll have to try it someday."
And -- and of those that I *have* had -- by far -- Shasta is the very best !!
W: "I like Shasta. I used to drink it in Florida, when I wasn't drinking alcohol."
üòä
Pepsi used to make a cherry cola -- and it was quite acceptable.
I haven't seen it lately though.
I've tried cherry Coke.
And -- just like regular Coke -- I do not like it.
Wolf h8s Pepsi. He's a Coca-Cola person. I tend to prefer any flavor of Pepsi (especially 'Wild Cherry') to comparable flavors of Coke. Wolf adds that 'Mountain Dew' is okay.
I rarely drink sodas anymore.   I might buy a 2-liter bottle of A&W root beer -- possibly 2 or 3 times a year.
Wolf: "I haven't drank soda-pop in Years. I mainly drink water or juices."
But my mainstay beverages are water and Mott's "Natural" Apple Juice.
I usually prefer juice to soda myself, but the soda is more affordable so I've tended to drink more of that over the past several Years.
Wolf: "We used to drink A&W when we'd go to the drive-in when I was a little boy. They had it just outside of the thE8r."
I understand the "affordable" thing.
W: "We watched: 'Good, Bad, and the Ugly' one time."
But I have never used "cost" as a strong determinant in my purchases of ingestibles.    
Wolf: "The more I'm getting to know you this way, the more I'm starting to love you as a friend.  üòä
"
Wolf: "Like people say: 'I'm dying to meet you.'  --  I say: 'I'm living to meet you!' "
Makes sense to me.
So is anything on your PCA for tonight Dad?
Conversation is the very heart of our connection to one another.
Notha.
Yours ?
Yours Wolf ?
W: "Mmm hmm. I respect that (convers8ion being the heart of connection together)."
No PCA items from me, at the moment.
Wolf: "None for me either. I'm just very pleased to know you and can't w8 to meet you."
üòä
Wolf: "I've never had people like you and your son to ever include me in convers8ions as you two do. It's very exhilar8ing to me."
W: "I'm honored."
Different people have many different ideas -- concerning what they believe God wants from us (His children).
It generally falls under the category commonly referred to as "worship".
Wolf: "I worship life."
I (personally) have come to believe that there are only 2 things which He wants of us.
I am honored that you are honored Wolf.
I treasure our conversations.
Thank you for being my friend Wolf.
Wolf: "You're welcome, very very much, with all my heart.  üòä
"
You have a good heart Wolf.
You are a wonderful person.
W: "My heart has been broken a lot of times, but I've been able to mend it, with good thoughts."
That is the ticket.
Vast numbers of people never learn that.
The Book of Philippians is very short.
Only 4 chapters.
And one of the most powerful verses in Philippians -- is the one that teaches what you just said.
It happens to be the longest verse in that Book too.
But I will capsulize it here.
                                                Mend your mind -- by feeding it only good thoughts.
Which -- is what you just said that you do.
           You are a very wise man Wolf.
Wolf: "My saying is: 'Never give up on humans.' "
Heartbreak is an important part of the earthly journey.
And -- learning to dwell on good thoughts -- is heartbreak's prime lesson.
W: "Understood."
Of course you understand it.     You are living it !!
Wolf: "That's exactly right.  üòä
"
Which is what true "standundering" is.
Oh.    The verse is:   Philippians 4:8.
Wolf: "I've never heard of Philippians before, but I see that we have the same understanding."
Reading The Bible is not the only way to wisdom.
Many people read it regularly -- and have gleaned very little wisdom from it.
You (it seems to me) have come by much of your wisdom -- from entirely within your self.
I'd argue that the Bible contains very little wisdom which is even possible to glean from it. Most non-Biblical books and other sources of perspectives on morality seem to contain more wisdom than the Bible, as far as I can tell so far.
This is your path.
Wolf: "I haven't read any books yet, but I will read the Bible, to try to understand it."
There is no prescribed path to wisdom.
Solomon said:   "Get wisdom."
I think Octology is becoming such a path to wisdom, which might someday become prescribed far and wide. We'll see.
     He did not say that there is a particular way to get it.
He just said that it is important to *get* it.
This is true Pip.
We'll see.
For -- seeing -- is what we all see      k.
Wolf:       The key to understanding the Bible -- is to -- ask questions.
W: "I am full of questions."
üòä
Yes you are Wolf.
It's one of the things that I *so* love about you.
Wolf: "Thank you, very much!"
You're welcome Wolf.
But it's not my fault.
The "fault" for your greatness is all yours.
üòä
W: "Hahaha. I thought the same thing.  üòä
"
Wolf: "Gr8 minds think alike."
Well it looks like we're winding down here, so may we please schedule to chat again next Friday night at our usual time?
Wolf: "With all my love, good night."
And mine also to you.
           Do I look like I am "winding down" ?
Wolf: "Until we talk again."
Am I a clock ?!
Our chat is winding down, not you so much.
Thank you both for tonight.
Maybe our enthusiasm for chatting here too.
You're welcome. Thank you too.

A good week -- was it ?
Yes, it was a good week. Thanks. How was yours?
Wolf: "Good Evening, my friend.  üòä
"
Had better.   Had worse.
     It was perfect.   Thank you for asking.
Good Evening Wolf.
     And how was your week ?
Why was yours good Pip ?
Wolf: "My week went very very well. Got to shovel snow... watch kids make a snowman."
Just watch ?
     Why not help ?
I was able to at least provide a prompt stop-gap work-around temporary solution to a user of one of my old online code libraries that he reported a troubling bug which he legitim8ly wanted fixed, in order to improve his JohnConway's Game-of-Life Simul8ion code that he had found pleasant to write using my Curses::Simp code. I was glad to be able to determine at least one way to facilit8 his desired behavior, and he (JimGuion) was kind enough to share his simul8ion code with me afterward, which I haven't studied much or attempted to run myself yet, but may attempt to do so somewhat soon, when my time permits.
Wolf: "They were just making 'snow-kids', only about 2 feet tall. They made a bunch of them."
Ok.  Thank you Wolf.
Well then Pip.   I'm glad for you -- and your friend.   Code is more satisfying -- when it works.

"Satisfaction" was the "Song of The Year" in 1965.
Last night, Wolf and I started talking about his ideas that there exists something like a "spark-of-life" and that the Earth might be like a living crE8ure. Your thoughts on either?
I quite like the Devo cover of the track: "Satisfaction".
     It held the #1 slot for a full 4 weeks (beginning of July to beginning of August) in 1965.
But I never liked the version that was #1 in 1965.
Ksenona does a better job on it.
I'm not sure if I've ever heard the Devo cover.
I can e-mail an audio-file of it to you, or maybe easier could be to upload it to Pip.BavL.Org for you to grab it from. Would you want to hear the Devo version I like?
Tell me more about your "spark-of-life" please.
I think I've got it.

Is this it ?
Oh, yeah. That's probably it too. That's easy.  üòä
Listening now.
In the Summer of 1965 -- I had just started my first full-time job as a radio announcer -- at WPAZ -- in Pottstown PA.
    I was there until November of '65 -- when Uncle Sam said:   
          "Set down that microphone boy -- tote this M-14 rifle for a while."
I wasn't happy about it.
     But I said:  "Ok.   If I must."
Everything was (and is) perfect.
     I went to Viet Nam for half of my 2-year hitch.
          Never fired my rifle there.
Met a lot of interesting people.
     Learned a lot of life lessons.
Wolf: "What branch of the military were you in? My Dad was in Patton's Infantry, Tanks-Division, Hell-on-Wheels."
          And "played" radio announce over there for about 6 months too.
Yes Wolf.   You had told me that before.   I remember.
Wolf: "Yeah, my Dad sparred and boxed with Joe Lewis."
Viet Nam was very much an "infantry & artillery" type of war.
Not sure if we had any "armor" divisions over there or not.
If we did -- I was never aware of any.
I was in 2 different artillery units during my 12 months in country.
6 months each.
Hq-7-13.
C-1-30.
(company/battalion/division)
The 7th Battalion had 105mm howitzers.
The 1st Battalion had 155mm howitzers.
The 155mm shells weighs about 93 pounds
-- and required 2 guys to lift one into the back of the cannon.
I never had to do that.
I was in "Fire Direction Control".
That is -- part of the team that computed (by hand / not computer) the data (settings) for the cannons to use.

Wolf: "Yeah, I wanted so badly to go into the military. I didn't care what branch. They said I wasn't smart enough.  üòû
"
Wolf: "I passed all the physical requirements with flying colors."
Well -- they were wrong -- but I am glad you did not have to go.
Wolf: "I wanted to defend my country... and I still do, if an enemy wants to come into this land."
I had a number of friend who did-not-come-back from that (highly) unpopular war.
Wolf: "Yeah, I had a lot of rel8ives that didn't come back."
Viet Nam was not about defending America.   That was what the great bulk of the protests were all about in the 1960s!
/friend/  /friends/
I never joined it any of the protest marches.
But I agreed with there sentiments.
I just did not agreed with their way of "speaking out" against it.
Wolf: "What I meant by 'spark-of-life' was: when crE8ion starts in the human process. When the sperm cell goes into the egg, that's when the spirit and the soul connect to make you a person."
/there/  /their/
s/joined it/joined in/; && yeah also s/there/their/; Caught that too.
s/agreed/agree/;
Yep.   Thank you Pip.
You're welcome. PedantPip at-your-service!  üòâ
üòä
Hmm.   Yes.  Lotss fo tyops tonihgt !!
You asked if I might make comments on the "spark-of-life" matter.
First -- I believe I need some definitions.
#1  -  spirit
#2  -  soul
Wolf: "They're 2 different things. Soul is what connects when you are crE8d in the egg... and if the Spirit connects with you, it's like having a person with you, without being able to see them, but you know that they're there because you can feel it."
I'm skeptical and doubtful that there's any tangibility or consistency or coherence or reliability or adequ8 predictability for either concept, but I acknowledge that my apparent opposition to ephemeral presumably super-n8ural or meta-physical entities as having veracity.
Err... I acknowledge that my experience may be incomplete and atypical. Something like that.
Hmm.   So it sounds to me like the 2 of you have quite a few points to "butt heads" on already.   Me thinks ye need not a 3rd kabbitzer added.
You could be correct about that. I think Wolf was hoping that you'd have any insight or opinion that you'd be willing to share and weigh into our differences of opinion on a potentially important matter such as the possible existence of Souls, Spirits, Spectres, Shadows, Shades, Ghosts, Apparitions, etc..
Wolf: "Mine don't argue. Just gives facts that it knows. I never learned any of this stuff. The words just come to me and make so much sense. Like he's tutoring me in the right direction."
If you think so -- ok.
Pip and I have some fairly different holdings on these kinds of issues.
And -- I'm ok with that.
Socrates loved "different holdings" in his coterie.
Wolf: "Animal and I both agree with you."
     And -- so do I.
          It makes for much learning -- on the part of everyone who participates.
Who is "Animal" ?
It can. Differing opinions are usually beneficial to have brought to bear on curious or significant topics.
Animal is Wolf's Spirit-Guide's primary name for now. It used to be "Wolf" and he was "Animal", but at some point they swapped. Wolf can't see Animal or he has no shape. Wolf: "He's just a part of me that I struggle to explain. He tells me things, when they seem necessary to hear."
Wolf: "Animal has saved my life many times."
I see.   Thank you.
üòä
Dad, can you please attempt to offer a definition of #1 Soul && #2 Spirit (assuming some distinction between)?
I can.
First -- an important preface.
You probably know that I am an avid "dictionary reader" -- as well as a quite fervent student in both etymology and morphology.
And -- since I have bothered to use those 2 words -- I should think that I should also offer a succinct definition for each one -- before we proceed further.
             They follow.
Very thoughtful. Both Wolf and I thank you for being so consider8.  üòä
etymology  =  the study ("ology") of the evolution of word usages.
                                    e-tym-ology      from-time-study
morphology  =  the study ("ology") of the formation (piecing-together) of words
                                    morph-ology     form-study
My "preface" now continues.
Wolf: (as a quick aside, which he wanted to inform you of in case you're interested and anticip8ing it, as we are): "The Stimulus Checks have been approved, and we should be getting them anytime now."
I have never found a dictionary (ever!) that has (either) a reasonably good definition for the word "soul" -- nor an entirely valid definition for the word "spirit".
Most dictionaries do (pretty well) on spirit -- but then they go on to make the matter very muddy -- by suggesting that "soul" and "spirit" are synonyms.
Wolf: "Animal tells me that he was around when the Earth began, and just went from crE8ure to crE8ure. I have a very old soul. He says it's as old as time."
                     They    are    not    !!
The big problem with dictionaries is:
           A word's definition -- is entirely dependent on how
          it is used.
And -- in the case of "soul" and "spirit" -- people use those words in so many different ways -- that lexicographers (dictionary writers) just end up scratching their heads.
I can say more on this -- but I shall stop for now.
I don't agree that it's "entirely" dependent, but can accept that they generally are predominantly dependent on usage, yeah. Some dictionary entries are more descriptivist while others lean more toward prescriptivist, in attitude toward "proper" usage or applicability.
Okay. We respect that. Thanks for sharing that much.
You're welcome.
Wolf: "I saw on TV, that they were talking about all kinds of different languages... and in different ones the word: 'dog' may not mean a canine, so they don't know where dog came from."
I will grant you that (occasionally) a lexicographer needs to tell us (in his dictionary) how *not* to use a word.   But -- if we do not heed his nudging
-- in the next edition -- he will "allow" our usage -- if it has become fairly widespread.
If you so wish -- we can (later) come back to this "soul/spirit" thing -- but (for now) I would like to get into something which Wolf has interjected here.
Puedo ?
Proceed.
Thank you.
Follows.
Wolf said:
"Animal tells me that he was around when the Earth began, and just went from crE8ure to crE8ure. I have a very old soul. He says it's as old as time."
Question for you Wolf:
Wolf: "Shoot! Go for it."
           How do you feel about what Animal has told you ?
Wolf: "Enlightened."
Good.
Am I accurate in stating that "Animal" is a spirit ?
Wolf: "Yeah... and he has a spirit too. He has a very intelligent spirit."
Ok.    But I want a bit more clarification -- if you can give it to me.
Does Animal *have* a spirit -- or -- *is* Animal a spirit ?
Wolf: "He is an old spirit. His spirit was a crE8ure that lived and died, and he just wandered through the forest as a spirit and like I said, when they built the Sanitarium Hospital, it was like a magnet, and they congreg8d... they went there because there were people there that had spirits that weren't nice, but they went there to be with them and when I was born, mine luckily, connected with me. He wasn't w8ing for me. He was just there... and when I was born, there was a connection, like we knew we were meant to be together."
Thank you Wolf.   I have noted all of that -- and I like it.   And I would like for us to get (much) more into all of that -- but first -- I'd like to make sure that  *I* am on *your* page.   ‚Ä¢   I believe that you have (therein) said that Animal does not *have* a spirit -- but instead Animal *is* a spirit.
          Is this correct ?
Wolf: "Yes. Very much so."
Good.
Thank you.
     Next question follows.
          You said:
"Animal tells me that he was around when the Earth began, and just went from crE8ure to crE8ure. I have a very old soul. He says it's as old as time."
There are 3 statements there.
The first one makes 2 points.
The other 2 statements each make 1 point.
First -- I'd like to get at this statement:
     "I have a very old soul."
Is that Animal speaking -- or Wolf speaking ?
Wolf: "Animal told me what to say."
And are you saying that about yourself, Wolf -- or about Animal ?
Sorry for the delay. Wolf asked about your Chinese Celestial Zodiac sign, so I was diverted away for a query to discover that your Sun. Aug. 8th of 1943 BirthD8 (SSA) was the sign of the Sheep. I made a note of it along with some of the typical tr8s or characteristics assoC8d with your sign... and Wolf would like to add: "No, we're not going to sheer you!  üòâ
"
That's very nice.
Wolf: "I'm saying that about Animal. He gives me insight. From what I can tell, we're like twins. We love, and like, the same things. He likes the cold and I love to please him by going out in it. He loves to roam in the woods or forests."
Good.   Now.   Let me see if I've got my notes correct here -- so far.
                Animal has a very old soul.
Is that correct ?
Wolf: "Exactamundo!"
Good.
Thank you.
Now.
     You also just said:
 From what I can tell, we're like twins.
And -- in most cases -- twins are usually the very same age -- at least within a few minutes (or so).
Yes ?
Wolf: "I'm a very old person. I've lived many lives."
Would I be correct in concluding that you (Wolf) and Animal are the same age ?
Wolf: "I can't exactly say 'Yes' or 'No'... but I can say we're like Siamese-Twins."
I'm seeing that it very strongly seems that you (Wolf) and Animal -- are essentially one (rather than two entities) -- except for only a single difference:  you have a skinsuit -- and Animal does not.
     Yes ?
Wolf: "Right! Yeah. Very good... very good. I never thought of it that way.  üòä
"
Xcellent.
This (then) will (naturally) bring me to (also) conclude that -- if Animal was around when the Earth began -- so were you -- albeit -- without having "put on" your skinsuit yet.
     Yes ?
Wolf: "Beautiful!"
Now.
I'd like to rewrite your 4-point / 3 sentences -- and then ask a few more questions.
Puedo ?
Wolf: "Yes. Be my guest."
Good.
Here we go.
 
Here is the original:
 
"Animal tells me that he was around when the Earth began,
  and just went from crE8ure to crE8ure.
I have a very old soul.
He says it's as old as time."
 
Here is the re-write:
 
Animal and Wolf were around when the Earth began,
 and we just went from creature to creature.
We (Animal and Wolf) have a very old soul.
Our soul is as old as time.
Wolf: "I thought the same thing. I just said what you say. I went from 'skin-suit' to 'skin-suit'."
 
Is the re-write accurate (correct) ?
Wolf: "Yes."
             Now.
Ready for the question ?
W: "Yes."
Good.
 
But first -- another re-write:
  
I (Wolf) was around when the Earth began,
 and I went from creature to creature.
I (Wolf) have a very old soul.
My soul is as old as time.
W: "Correct."
 
And now for the question.
W: "But I have a merciless soul."
 
What does all of this tell you ?
And -- after you have answered my question -- I'd like to return to the comment you just interjected.
W: "That I'm very much at peace with myself."
Good.
I was expecting (a bit) more -- but that is excellent for now.
W: "That's why I want to learn more about your Points-of-Light, because I very much agree with what I've heard of them so far."
 
         ... is a very goood thing.
W: "Hahahahaha. I love it! That's funny. LoL!  üòä
"
I love you Wolf.
W: "I love you back."
     You are a very spiritual man.
üòä
Thank you Wolf.
W: "You're very welcome."
I've got another question Wolf.
Puedo ?
W: "Please do."
Good.
It (of course) is based on:
  
I (Wolf) was around when the Earth began,
 and I went from creature to creature.
I (Wolf) have a very old soul.
My soul is as old as time.
 
Are not you (Wolf) and Animal (in truth)
the creators of the world -- the Earth
-- and all else ?
W: "Oh... I can only wish."
Nope.
You must eat truth -- to live truth.
And -- he who lives truth -- is Truth itself.
W: "Ah, yes. Very wise. Confucius couldn't say it better."
Although Pip may dance around at the hearing of this -- You (Wolf) and Animal are God.
You created all.
W: "Oh, my God! That's deep! I can only... I'm at a loss for words."
Just because you don't remember doing it -- does not mean it is not so.
Is a "God" necessarily immortal? What is a God?
We (here) are not talking about "a god".
There is only One.
And the skinsuit that sits beside you Pip -- is that One.
W: "I'm humbled."
As you (also) were before you spoke the heavens and the earth into being -- with your mouth.
     Piece of Light #27.
W: "Ah. Gr8! Thank you."
Genesis, Chapter I -- is not a story about someone else.
It is your story.
The word "genesis" means "beginning".
And Genesis, Chapter I -- is the beginning of the story of you.
Pre-skinsuit.
W: "I'm glad I met Pip, and the both of you made me feel very... very welcome.  üòä
"
Me too.
I'm glad you met Pip.
And -- I'm glad I met you, Wolf.
üòä
W: "I don't want to repeat myself over and over again... but I can't w8 until we can meet face-to-face.  üòä
  üòä
"
Humph!   üòä
Oh yeah ?   üòä
Well.   üòä
You're   üòä
just   üòä
gonna   üòä
hafta.   üòä
Piece of Light #13.
W: "Excellent. You're officially part of my pack.  üòä
"
Uh -- Pip -- is that a good thing ?
Heh. Probably. He can keep you guessing a bit though.  üòâ
lol
That he can !!
üòä
Wolf: "Is there a chance that you could please mail me copies of your Pieces-of-Light to 808-A Frederick Street, Oshkosh, Wi 54901 so that I could read them and learn more about them myself, from the comfort of my own home? That would be totally fantastic!"
Thank you for asking Wolf.
The answer is (respectfully):   absolutely not.
W: "As you wish."
The proper (and ordained) way of receiving The 29 Pieces of Light --
is to take out your pen and paper --
and copy them down for your self.
W: "That's possible too."
I am told that Pip has The 29 Pieces of Light written down.
If he is willing to show you his copy -- there you go Wolf.
And -- as you may be wondering -- what are you to do with them -- once you have them down on paper ?
                                    Eat them.
W: "Like, I guess my 'Pieces-of-Light' is what I say, over and over again. No matter what, survive, endure. What doesn't kill me makes me stronger... and Don't give up on humans."
And -- as you eat them -- they become the very "who" and "how" of you.
How do you learn more about each of the Pieces ?
W: "Survival."
         The answer is:    Piece of Light #11.
Use pen & paper.
Ask your questions on paper.
Then wait.
W: "I'm working on it. It's not easy. I'm trying the best I can."
And when the answer comes -- write it down too.
Then -- ask your next question.
All good things take time.
I believe in you Wolf.
You shall become one of the greatest teachers of the Pieces of Light -- on this Earth.
Wolf has very little educ8ion toward literacy. He's steadily learning to read more and more proficiently each day he attempts to expand his pronunC8ion capabilities, but still has very little practice or guidance regarding how to write. He also faces additional challenges due to having undergone surgeries for Carpal-Tunnel syndrome in both arms, so has difficulties with the dexterity required for precision writing implement control, as far as I understand it.
This is one of the reasons that you are in each other's lives Pip
You are to be his rabbi.
As (also) he is to be yours.
And -- you both are mine !!
Yeah, we do teach each other.
üòä
Wolf: "What's uuup? Hehe."
W: "I'm getting tired. Was up practically all night last night. I'm running out of words."
I don' know.
Possibly our "time" is up for tonight.
Shall we reconvene at another time ?
I loved our chat tonight gentlemen.
     Thank you so much.
I ‚ù§
 you both.
You teach me so much.
Wolf: "Yes, please. Next time, I'll have a sharper mind, because I should have had a more proper amount of sleep... but it was good chatting with you."
     I appreciate your friendship.
Thanks, Dad. I ‚ù§
you too.
W: "All my love!"
üòä
When is our next session ?
     Fri Feb 19 2021 ?
     Or  ...  ?
Sure. Sounds good, probably for both of us here.
Ok.
It's a date.
Thank you gentlemen.
Have a gr8 rest of your night, Dad.  üòä
     Have a good night, weekend, and week.
Thank you Pip.

I'm going to run to the kitchen for a few minutes. You can please feel free to talk to Wolf all you want, and I should return shortly.
Shabbat Shalom Gentlemen.
Dear Pip.
     I am here with Wolf.
I have a question for both of you.
     Puedo ?
Proceed. I am back.  üòä
Thank you.
     Question follows.
          Am I ready for you ?
No. You couldn't be "ready" for what we represent!  üòâ
What do you represent ?
Wolf: "We represent the past, the future, and the present!"  Prepare yourself!  üòâ
  üòä
How might I do that ?
You might have to determine that mostly by yourself. Ask questions, and we may assist though.
Thank you.
I have determined that I am not ready for you.
     How shall we proceed ?
Wolf: "You might prepare by developing your wits!"
Wolf: "That's how I survived."
Wits ?
Where shall I find "my wits" ?
W: "My inner thoughts. The thoughts that Animal tells me, in my head."
Ah ha.
     Thank you Wolf.
You're welcome.
Wolf: "How's your Day doing? Would love to hear it."
It was a good day.
     A number of things accomplished.
          I'm glad about them.
How has your day (and your day) been ?
Wolf: "Oh... my Day has been very very nice. I'm very happy with the way things are going."
Thanks, Dad. My Day has been quite good too.  üòä
W: "... and now it's even better now that I get to communic8 with you."
Well (1) good (2) good (3) very sweet of you.
üòä
Wolf: "Oh, sure, sure. That's gr8."
Are we communicating ?
     The "room" seems a bit quiet.
Yes, we're communic8ing... to some limited extent. The "room" (Google HangOuts Chat Forum) is rel8ively quiet. Type something, if you want more "noise".  üòâ
W: "LoLoL!"
Ok.
I can do that.

 Do you want us to watch and listen to this right now... and then maybe comment about it, or just continuing to listen to our own music here, and just imagine your Beatles suggestion?
We've got Obsidia's "Unity (all people of Earth are truly, *not One ScotsMan*!)" finished up just past, && now "United" on from OurStolenTheory as coolio DrubStep trax.  üòä
My Ubuntu DisplayManager DesktopEnvironment thingy is also called "Unity".
I see.
Thank you.
It's also the name of a highly popular Game-Development-Engine software used to develop many top-notch games. I have little experience with it, so far.
You're welcome.
We're listening to Something now. Wolf loves it, and is singing along somewhat. Also, we're recording our chat session tonight as a video, maybe eventually for my JewJesus8 YouTube channel eventually, since we're going over other Octology stuff and he's working on writing some MorseCode descriptions from .Hrc and we may chat about other stuff since he joins as guest on many of my channels.  üòä
Wolf: "That was wonderful! I remembered the song well. I went to a Beatles ... uhm, re-enactment, and they did YellowSubmarine, Mr. NoWhereMan, just a bunch of different songs... and everybody was in the age-limit, and everybody sang back to them their song. We all just sang and partied. Hehe."
Sounds wonderful.
I'm glad you got to do that.

In late-June or early-July of 1969 -- I met Dorothy.
On Sunday, August 17th -- we had our first date.
 
In late-June or early-July of 1969 -- I met Dorothy.
On Sunday, August 17th -- we had our first date.
 
In September -- she began her Senior year of high
school -- at St. Bernard's -- located on the very
edge of Los Angeles International Airport -- while
I was just starting at Los Angeles City College.
 
1969 was also the year that The Beatles had veritably
risen to "the top of their game".  During that year
-- they had numerous mega-hits.
 
And one of them was "Something" -- which climbed
to #3 on The Charts -- by November of 1969.
 
(//)
Wolf: "No doubt. Yeah. The Beatles were rockin'!"
You were 11 Wolf.
Philip was still in heaven in 1969.
W: "I used to watch a TV show called: 'The Banana Splits' with Groover. You've probably heard of it?"
I wasn't in "heaven". Come on!? How could you claim that, or think you know such a thing?
Yes -- I remember "The Banananananas".
     I know how to spell it.
          I just don't know when to stop !
üòä
Well -- Pip --
It is my understanding that Wolf and Animal were together in 1957.
     Do you remember that Wolf ?
Wolf: "Uhhhmmm... no. I didn't know Animal until I got into my 50's and 60's. I just went by the name: 'BigFoot'."
Correct.    Knowledge frequently trails the actual happenings of events.
But -- you told me last week that:  You and Animal are One.
     Yes ?
W: "Oh, yes, we are! Very much so."
So then -- I guess my question really is:
W: "We keep each other company, when we're by ourselves... so I don't go crazy due to loneliness."
     Where was Animal in 1957 ?
Of course.
     Loneliness was God's #1 problem on the 5th day.
Wolf: "Animal... he was probably in the Sanitarium. He was floating around. He was in the Sanitarium Hospital... and when I was born, when I was coming out of my Mom, that's when we connected, and he's been my best friend every since."
Xcellent Wolf.
     I'm so happy for you !!
üòä
W: "Eh, hehe."
Wolf: "When we come up to see you, I'd like to try to hear you talk to me. I want to hear your 'Radio-Voice'."
W: "Even just making noise, I can take that as trying."
W: "I have a very wide range of communic8ion."
I have a recording of a small portion of a radio show that I did on WHUM 1240 AM -- in Reading PA -- back in late 1980 -- the year that Pip turned 4.
However -- it is on vinyl -- and I no longer have a phonograph machine.
Wolf: "Oh. I'd like to *see* [sic, hear, er um read] that."
So -- I guess you'll have to wait on that.
Some day -- I'll probably get someone to transfer it to a CD for us.
üòä
Ah well. Yeah, if you can recover that audio as maybe an MP3 or OggVorbis or maybe FLAC would be gr8 someday.
W: "Oh, yes, I would love to hear your voice."
I would too.
That would be rad. CD's are excellent.
I also have a photo of 4-year-old Philip from that same time (Dec 1980).
But it is on Tera -- not Sammi.
     So -- that's a w8 too.
üòä
Okay, Dad. I think we're going to wrap things up for tonight. Wolf: "It has been gr8 talking with you. My best wishes for the good night. Can't w8 to talk to you again."  üòä
  üòä
Hopefully we can plan to chat again on next Friday evening, Feb. 26th, around our usual time?
Wolf: "2 Days before my sister's BirthDay. She's going to be 45. She might be the same age as Pip right now. She's got 3 kids (or just 1?) in their 20's. I think it's her daughter that's 23 or 24."
Ah yes -- Date of Birth:  Feb 28 1976.
     Her name is ?
No. She's like 46 actually, turning probably 47 at the end of this Month. He just got her on the phone.
Tracy, I'm pretty sure. They're talking over his phone now.
Nice.
So -- she was born in 1974 ?
Wolf: "Yep."
Good.     Tracy -- Feb 28 1974.
I had one other thing on my PCA for tonight.
Not important.
But -- do we have time for it ?
Sure. Go ahead.
Ok.
Thank you.
I shall.
 
I've been using credit/debit cards for over
50 years now -- and I had never lost a card.
 
Also -- I had never found someone else's card.
 
     Until -- very recently.
 
Last week's Wednesday (Feb 10) -- I lost my
card.  But -- I did not become aware of it
until 3 days later (Sat Feb 13) -- when I
went to use it again.
 
    It was gone/gone.
W: "Wow. I had a debit card for 21 Years. That was the only one I've ever had. Now I'm getting (hopefully) an Amazon $1000 gift-card."
 
I thunk about it some.  Figured out where I
had last used it -- and guessed that I must
have dropped it before leaving Wednesday's
store.
 
So -- on Monday (February 15, 2021) -- I went
back to that store -- and asked if anyone had
"turned-in" my card.
 
    And -- someone had.  
  
I was "through-the-roof" with JOY !!
 
The time was 1517 Wed Feb 15 2021.
 
And 46 minutes later -- I was at the
Reading Public Library -- at 1603.
  
And what did I find on the floor ?
 
Yep.  Someone had lost
their debit card there.
 
(//)
Okay. So again chatting probably on the 26th?
Yep.
Thank you (two) for tonight's chat.
Have a grreat week.
Cool. You're welcome.
You too!  üòä
I ‚ù§
 you both.
Thank you.
Wolf: "... and Same to you."
I ‚ù§

Shabbat Shalom Dad.
Shabbat Shalom Gentlemen.
Wolf is with me here. We're watching HTTPS://YouTu.be/FmTFk_UWBaE about grandpas smoking marijuana for the first time. You might enjoy watching it too.  üòâ
Thanks. We hope you're well too.
Eye  Yam.
     Thank you for the "prayer".
üòä
Yes -- I know (one of) you doesn't like to call it that -- but every "hope" is a prayer.
     Sorry.
I ‚ù§
 you both.
And how was your weeks ?
     Or -- should I say:  How was yourses week ?
I ‚ù§
you too. I also still insist that hopes most certainly should *not* be considered prayers. I don't believe there is sufficient evidence that any god has ever existed, and if any "God" were to exist that at all resembled the Being described in Bibles, such a being would not be worth respecting or praying to. I can hope things. I do not pray things.
Hmm.
     I'm thingging.
Ok.
I'm done thigging.
Comments follow.
#1 - you are correct.
Wolf: "I do not pray to my god. I talk to him. I also learned from my psychic named Elissa that maybe the more correct name for my 'Animal' guardian-angel is 'Yehuiah'. She told me I have wealth coming my way. I got lucky and won 2 Amazon $1000 gift-cards!  üòä
"
        Evidence that God exists ?
            No - anyone who says that He does cannot
            present any real substantial evidence.
So -- #1 -- I agree.
Wolf: "Okay. That's awesome! ... but I have my guardian-angel who doesn't exist in our plane, but I know he's around me."
#2 - Now.   I have a question.
     Puedo ?
Yes. (both Wolf and I are ready for your question) Please proceed.
I shall get back to Wolf soon.
The following Q is to you Pip.
If you (both) wish to discuss it before you (Pip) answer it -- that's fine with me.
But no 2 people on earth believe the same thing(s).
So I'd like a "Pip" answer.
     Here comes the Q.
You said that you hope that I am well.
And (in the very next instant) I reported that "I am".
What made me well ?
Perhaps what made you well was merely my genuine interest in, && concern or positive wishing, for you to be well? Basically my hope made you well?
You made 2 statements.
But you ended both with a question-mark.
This suggests to me that you are not (real) sure of either of your answers.
     But --
Correct. Unsure.
I liked both of your answers.
Shouldst I go on ?             Do you wish to ?
Yes. Yes, please.
Which?    You first ?    Or I ?
Ah. You can go on first.
Ok.
Thank you.
I shall.
The first thing I'd like to bring up is:
      a very astute point which Wolf had inserted.
He said:          "I do not pray to my god.    I talk to him."
And I say:           Xacktimundo !!!
The words "talk" and "pray" are (almost) synonyms.
Wolf: "... and I don't talk to my god. I talk to my angel. I don't believe in a god. He is my 'Animal'."
And the major distinction is with the word "pray".
"talk" is pure.
"pray" is "talk" plus something added.
I disagree that "talk" and "pray" are (almost) synonymous. They indic8 very different activities, in almost every instance I've ever been exposed to.
All prayer is talking.
But -- not all talking is prayer.
The word "prayer" (for most people's mental definition) is:
     "talking with God"   or (at least)   "talking to God".
But -- right now -- the 3 of us are assuming the non-existence of any God.
At least -- for the purposes of this discussion.
Now.
Next question for you Pip.
Puedo ?
I would also still contend that *not* "all prayer is talking" either. Talking overwhelmingly implies vocaliz8ions (i.e., making audible sound through utterances of voice), while much prayer is internal silent thinking, and *not* spoken.
Please proceed.
            You said:
Perhaps what made you well was merely my genuine interest in, && concern or positive wishing, for you to be well? Basically my hope made you well?
In spite of your Q-marks -- I say that both of your statements -- were spot-on.
You interest made me well.
Your interest made me well.
Your wishing made me well.
Your hope made me well.
I'm glad.
You (in none of those cases) asked any God -- or anyone else to make me well.
Some power within you (yourself) created the wellness within me.
            Is that not a fair assumption ?
Wolf: "That's very spot-on! Very well put."
I agree that it does sound like a fair assumption.
Thank you Wolf.
Wolf: "I don't talk. I speak in my mind, most of the time."
And -- thank you Pip also.
You're welcome.  üòä
Now -- let's get into the point that you were making on "talking" Pip.
You want to say that "talking" is always physically audible.
That's ok with me.
No... just usually audible.
Connotes audibility.
I see "talking" in a broader sense.
To me "thinking" is a form of talking.
Some people call thinking "self-talk".
It largely is for me too, although not entirely.
That's ok with me.
But sometimes we think not only in words.
Right.
Some of our thinking is in pictures.
Sometimes even (moving) pictures.
Agreed. Also many kinds of other sorts of mechanisms, at least for me it seems.
Sometimes our thinking is also in feelings.
When you think about me -- and the thoughts are warm and/or nice -- this creates wellness in me.
Wolf: "I love you like a brother... from a different mother. Haha!"
You make me well -- by your thought-power toward me.
You have the power (within you) not only to create your own world -- but also the worlds of those you think about.
Wolf makes my world.
I doubt such "warm" or "nice" thoughts can literally or directly "crE8" wellness in you. I don't find there to be credible evidence for psychic control of other's well-being to be amidst my cognitive powers... as of yet.
And also Pip's.
And you both make mine.
(//)
             You just said:
I doubt such "warm" or "nice" thoughts can literally or directly "crE8" wellness in you. I don't find there to be credible evidence for psychic control of other's well-being to be amidst my cognitive powers... as of yet.
Thanks, Dad. I don't agree that power resides within me to crE8 my own world, or worlds of those I think about. Not in a literal sense of the words "crE8" and "world"... but there can be some sense that I have powers to impact the world in ways that might be somewhat significant or even authorit8ive in some senses... which probably are not all that direct either, from many perspectives.
Are you saying that what you said about 45 minutes ago -- were (totally) empty and powerless words ?
             You said:
"We hope you're well too."
No. I'm saying that what is said is different from world-crE8ion that is individu8d for each possible being that can be thought about.
Words weren't empty or powerless, but neither are they likely to be sufficient to crE8 personalized customized worlds in-and-of-themselves either.
Then -- I must have lied.
Did I ?
Where (in this conversation) did you note that I intentionally lied ?
Maybe you misunderstood what would constitute "world-crE8ion" for me, without intending to deliber8ly lie about anything. We probably just disagree on critical meanings of terms which you've presumed are sufficiently shared.
You've lost me with that last comment.
     My question was:
Where (in this conversation) did you note that I intentionally lied ?
I didn't note that you intentionally lied. You probably didn't, and rarely, if ever, do.
Good.
Now.
I'm going to relate a few lines to you.
And -- I'd like to ask that you wait for the selah -- before responding.
     Is that ok with you ?
Okay. Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
--------------
You (both) said:
"We hope you're well too."
     The "you're" is equivalent to "you are".
"are" indicates present tense.
You did not say:   "I hope your week went well."   (past tense)
You did not say:   "I hope you were well before we called to chat."   (past tense)
You said:   "We hope you are well."
I responded with:   "Eye Yam"  /  "I am".
I did not have a week of total wellness.
I was not entirely well before our chat began this evening.
But --
     when you both (Pip & Wolf) "hoped" wellness upon me --
          I became well.
You're power (within yourselves) made me well.
     God did not do it.
You (Wolf & Pip) did it.
(//)
Wolf: "Now we can talk? I am very pleased, and honored to hear you say that. I have the best wishes for you."
I am similarly glad that our shared hopes that you would be well caused (or at least meaningfully contributed to) the likelihood that you would be so.
You (Wolf) are the co-creator of my life.
Without you in my life -- my life would be very different.
Wolf: "Oh. I'm glad to hear that. I am very ... at a loss for words.  üòä
"
If you (Pip) do not think that you have been a major contributor to the "making" (creating) of my life -- you just have not been paying a-10-shun (attention).
Your Mom has been creating me for nearly 70 years.
You -- for nearly 45.
Wolf -- for a few months.
I -- for a bit longer.
We don't know what you mean by that.
But I -- am a co-creation.
Your thoughts -- mold the being (me) of me.
What you say.
What you hope.
What you wish.
Those things make me !!
I have to urin8. Please feel free to keep typing to Wolf, and I'll catch up once I return. Maybe he can try to do some typing of his own, on my HappyHackingKeyBoard.
You are not only my friends.
You are also my teachers.
And -- thereby -- you are my Makers.
May I please ask why you were not doing so well before we began chatting tonight?
Of course
Stuff happens.
Some of it is pleasant.
Some -- not so.
Have you even found yourself in a "bad mood" ?
Of course you have.
Yes.
And what brought you out of it ?
         Wolf or Pip - or both ?
Q is open to whomever.
Usually just time, for me.
And -- what happens over the course of time -- that is able to repair my mood ?
Your outlook can evolve && eventually recognize newer, hopefully brighter, opportunities to look forward to ahead again, in spite of having weathered a bad mood.
Yep.
What causes an "outlook" to change ?
Attitude. Vantage-point. Distress. Optimism. Stimul8ion... etc.;
Yep.
And what changed my mood -- at the beginning of this chat ?
You did.
     You hoped me into wellness.
          Thank you Wolf                                 and Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
     You make me well.
I ‚ù§
you too. Glad you've been made well.
Thank you.
üòä
You're welcome.
I have some email comments and questions.
     Puedo ?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
Thank you for all of your emails of this past week Wolf.
     Very nice of you.
Wolf: "I'm just learning how to spell, and doing the best I can."
One is labeled:   Kenneth Van Clake.
     I like that label.   It tells me who is emailing me.
The other 3 each came with a label of only a 10-digit number.
     Very un-identifying.
Can we get those changed in the future ?
Wolf: "I'll try the best I can, and when I get better, I'll e-mail WolfGang@EMail.Com"
Ok.     Thank you.
üòä
Also -- a question for you Pip.
Each time you send me an email -- Gmail automatically puts a "Pip" tag on it.
I'm guessing I must have done something to make that happen.
     But I don't remember what.
How can I automate the "Wolf" tag to emails from him ?
Up until now -- I have had to do it manually -- for each one.
I'm not exactly sure, but I'm pretty sure you can select the option to crE8 a new "Filter" called "Wolf" which you should then be able to auto-tag any further incoming e-mails from him to the new tag by his name. Something like that. I can look into it more closely, and reply to you with more precise and specific details once I've had a chance to gather more for you.
Thank you.    Let me try that.
I'll give that a go this (coming) week.
Hold off on your (offered) research.
If I haven't discovered it by next Friday -- I'll ask again.
     Thank you so much.
Okay.
PCA items Wolf ?
                                             PCA items Pip ?
None for me, right now.
Ok.
Wolf ?
So -- are we all about "exhausted" for this evening ?
Wolf: "I'd like to tell you what Pip just discovered about a meaning of my name."
Do so please.
Wolf: "Ken is a synonym for cognizance, awareness, discernment, knowledge, etc. which we both found to be a remarkable and significant thing to discover.  üòä
"
This is correct.
But you have missed one of the primary 5.
You said:  "remarkable & significant".    Why ?
Because we had just been discussing consciousness and cognizance the Day before.
Ah ha.
Thank you.
Are you both asleep !!
No.
     Someone should be asking a question about now.
Wolf: "I didn't sleep last night, so I'll probably get some tonight."
Ok then.
I'll save the answer to the question someone should have asked -- until March or April then.
I was awake throughout the entire night too.
Wolf: "I'll probably contact you from my phone, maybe tomorrow sometime. Tomorrow I'm getting a nice leather chair for my house.  üòä
"
Sounds great Wolf.
I have spend much time in "my chair" over the past 60 years.
üòä
It's where I do most of my serious thinking -- and (also) a good deal of my writing -- usually hours per day.
Is it Z-ville time ?
Probably.
Well -- ok then.
Thanks for chatting tonight. I ‚ù§
you Dad.
Wolf: "I love you, and talk to you again soon."
Thank you so much for a nice chat session.
I ‚ù§
 yuhs too (two).
Shall we plan for next Friday night again?
Do all 3 of us want to ?
Probably.
Well let's see the Osh ballots.
     Pennsylvania votes "yes".
L2QLLULL
Yes.
Good.
W: "Yes."
Ok.
It's a date.
Have a good night y'all.
You have a good night too, Dad.  üòä
Thank you.

Happy Friday, Dad!  üòä
  Wolf is here with me.
5'03-05-21 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Wolf: "Hello, my friend."  üòä
Shabbat Shalom Gentlemen.
Shabbat Shalom.
Wolf: "How was your day today? Mine was great!"
Tell me about your "great" please.
Wolf: "Oh, I'm just having a wonderful day. I did a bunch of work last night writing down so much of what I've been learning from Pip about how to use binary code. It is getting so easy. I think they should teach that in Elementary. They teach Algebra and stuff... so why not?"
He can consistently count from Zero through 31 on just his left hand now, and is starting to add his right hand into the mix, getting up into the hundreds now with just 7 fingers so far. He learns fast and is enjoying doing it. He's a gr8 student. I'm proud of him.  üòä
I agree with you Wolf.
And I applaud you for your Xcellent progress.
I'm proud of you both.
Wolf: "Hmmm.  üòä
"
Can you count binary on your fingers yet, Dad?
Sorry.
Computer problems.
Can you count binary on your fingers yet, Dad?
No.   But -- I can on my toes.
Up to 1023.
I'll have to try adding my hands to that.
Nice. Yeah, you can get over a Million if you use both toes && fingers together.  üòâ
Yes -- actually 1,048,575 then.
1,048,575 total (for using 10 toes && 10 fingers together).
Jinx!  üòâ
Very good boys.
Who found that number ?   You Wolf ?   Or Pip.
I, Pip, did.
         In any case -- I thought I was smelling someone's feet !!
I have a super-high-precision calculator utility I wrote called "Q" (for cal-Q-l8or), so I just run in any of my text-mode terminal programs: `q 2xx20` to get result: "1048576".
Those might be mine!  üòâ
  I rarely shower, or use any body-soap when I do. Mostly just shampoo with a bit of lather all over, for the easy quick cleaning. My hot-water-heater barely lasts 10 minutes or so. Wish I had a bigger one that would let me take much longer hot showers, when I need one. Hopefully someday, I will... at my next apartment, maybe back in Los Angeles. We'll see.
Neat program.
üòä
You'll have it too, once you start running && learning Octology, as we do.
Well -- when you buy the Mallard complex -- I hope you install better HWHs.
My standard shower length is 12 minutes.
I guess that clinches it.
I won't be moving into your building.
My (corrent) hot-water-heater is good for about a 37-hour shower.
Awesome!
Of course -- that's what you get when you live in a building designed to serve 300 residents.
Do you have a HWH for your own apartment -- or one for all 8 units in your building ?
I have a small one just for my unit. Part of my problem is the stopper on the bath spout that sends the water up to the shower-head doesn't make anything like a good seal, so only about a 3rd of the water even goes up && most of it just pours str8 down the drain. Oh well.
Well then.   We certainly see that your situation is not a heater-capacity problem.
     Have you called maintenance about the seal ?
Wolf: "Pip just e-mailed me your 29 Pieces-of-Light and the 13 Axioms he has, out of your 27. I am going to read them carefully when I get home tonight. Pip read them to me before, and I found them to be very interesting.  üòä
"
Maintenance here never does anything about service requests. They're terrible.
So -- move to Venice.
Their maint departments are much gooder.
üòä
When I can, I will... or North Hollywood, to be near Danny.
Wolf:   Throw them all away please.
Have you communicated with Danny lately ?
Yep.
Good for you.
Wolf: "Why?!"
How is he doing ?
He's mostly quite good. He's just starting to get into doing embedded programming for the ARM Cortex M4 processor and I am going to try to get the same development hardware that he's getting, so that we can both learn how to code for it together.
Great.
üòä
He has to take care of his Dad every day though, which is pretty tough, because his Dad is suffering from escal8ing dementia unfortun8ly.  üòû
And this is good -- why ?
Wolf: "There's nothing good about it."
If you wish to believe that -- that's ok Wolf.
But it will not make you a happy camper.
Wolf: "What's wrong with campin'? I can be a 'happy-camper'!  üòâ
"
Because -- when you choose to harbor a "non-happy-making" untruth -- you (of course) shall be un-happy.
Wolf: "I don't understand."
Good.
Every situation / occurrence / experience / circumstance -- has (both) a good side -- and a bad side.
Wolf: "My reading is good."
If I see only one side -- that is a result of my own choice.
Wolf: "Yeah. I can see that... and I only have good thoughts."
Good for you Wolf.
However --
     when any of us says (about anything):   "There's nothing good about it."  -- then:
            "I only have good thoughts"  -- is not a truth.
Wolf: "I try to see the bright side of everything... but if gloominess comes upon me, then so-be-it. I work through it to the best of my ability."
Xcellent Wolf.
"gloominess" is a part of life.
And -- it is a good thing.
It is a gift.
W: "Yeah, it is. Sometimes not good, but you just have to keep going."
W: "Like that song: 'If you're going through Hell, keep on going.' "
If this is not true than Piece of Light #29 is wrong.
s/than/then/;
Gloomines, sadness, disappointment, frustration, et al -- are all part of life.
Yes -- I agree -- they do not feel good.
But -- they are good.
And -- they are gifts.
Wolf: "The gifts in life, to me, are education, through experience."
The purpose of Piece #29 -- is for just those situations in our lifes.
s/lifes/lives/;
And -- you are right Wolf -- Piece #29 is education.
And saying "lifes" when one means "lives" is education too.
üòä
T.Y.P.
(thank you Pip)
You're welcome.
Wolf: "What are you thinking? Haven't heard from you in a while."
I was thinking that you have asked me some questions that I have not answered.
W: "So, I gave you some questions that you have no answers for? Sorry about that!)
s/$/"/;
Not your fault.
s/\)//;
When people talk -- a number of issues (usually) tend to "fall through the cracks" as other issues rise to a greater importance at a particular moment.
If those that fell -- are of sufficient importance to someone in the conversation -- it is up to one of those persons to re-bring it back up.
In a text-chat -- this is (somewhat) easier to do -- than in strictly verbal communication --
because we can look back over that text -- to find "the lingerers".
And no -- I did not say (and do not mean) that you " gave me some questions that I have no answers for   ".
Wolf: "I was just talking about life-situations, learning, ... I don't know."
I just meant that some of your questions ended up "falling out".
No -- I think the "life-situations" subject came to a reasonable end.
Of course -- no subject is (ever) "all talked out".
But -- some have reasonable "ending points" and others tend to have definite "lingering" elements.
Wolf: "Like I said before, I've never had conversations with people like this, and it's all still new to me."
lol
Me too.
üòä
Pip came to my crib in March of 2007 -- and demanded that I get an email account.
Wolf: "... but these conversations are very enlightening to me.
And in October of 2019 -- he demanded  that we chat every Friday evening too.
I love Pip.
I love you too, Dad.
And I love Pip for these (and other) "demands".
He is not only my son, and my friend.   He is (very much) my teacher.
As (also) are you Wolf.
My son / my friend / and my teacher !!
W: "Thank you. That's very kind!"
You're very welcome Wolf.
Thank you for being my teacher.
     And son.
          And friend.
W: "I just do my best.  hmm.  üòä
"
I ‚ù§
 you Wolf.
Wolf: "Same back to ya."
10-Q Wolf.
Shall I re-open one of the lingerers now ?
Wolf: "When I read your Pieces-of-Light, I might e-mail you to tell you my thoughts of them, to the best of my ability."
I told you to throw those away please Wolf.
Wolf: "No. I'm interested in them."
Wolf: "I want to get to know you... and what you think."
Good.   Be interested -- if you wish -- but throw those lists away please.
Wolf: "Why?! They're your writing."
But they are not.
Wolf: "Then why did you write them? I'm interested."
I share them -- because I walk them -- and in the walking of them -- they work for me.
Wolf: "... and if you have the books that you would like me to read, I would like to get them too. Would you like me to practice them, so that I can speak in front of a group, for [Fix-the-Radio] ? "
     And thereby -- I believe that by sharing them with others -- others may (possibly) be helped by them also.
W: "Hmm. Maybe they'll help me somehow."
Throw them away please.
Wolf: "After I read them, I might... if you want that."
No.   Throw them away first.
Wolf: "I will, if you send me the books that you're writing for your Seminars."
I cannot do that Wolf.
I'm sorry.
W: "Why not?"
A number of reasons -- a few of which follow.
#2 - there are no books.
#3 - the Seminars "content" is not mine.
Wolf: "I'm still interested to meet you, as a person."
I am looking forward to that Wolf.
When shall we do that ?
Wolf: "As soon as I can."
Why do you wish to see my envelope ?
Wolf: "Because I've heard so much about you. I'm all about people. I'm a people-person. I like to meet people."
That's good Wolf.
W: "Especially when I've gotten to know you over the e-mails. I've never done that before. I'm interested in you."
Tell me the first name of a person you met last year (2020) and only saw them less than 5 times please.
Wolf: "I don't judge a person by minutes."
Wolf: "Like the first time I met Pip... from the first moment he asked me if I wanted a ride, I didn't know him but from when we met at Salv8ionArmy, I knew we would be friends."
And you are.
     I'm glad about that.
For both of you.
     And for me too.
Thank you Wolf.
W: "You're very welcome."

              whoops

Wolf: "I know we're gonna be friends for a long time."
Okay Dad. I'm getting pretty tired. Let's please wrap chat up for the night, and schedule for again next Friday at our usual time please?

Happy FriDay Evening Dad. Wolf is here with me again.  üòä
How are things with you?
5'03-12-21 - 2001 Gtime / 1901 Ptime
Shabbat Shalom Gentlemen.
Shabbat Shalom.
Well.   I thought I was ok.
But -- at 2000 G 1900 P -- Gchat wouldn't let me in.
But I'm here now.
So -- all is perfect.
Thank you for asking.
How are you ?
You're welcome.
I'm doing decently, thanks.
Wolf: "I'm doing good."
Wolf: "Still working on the Binary Code."
Good.     Good.     And what are you planning to do with the Binary Code ?
Wolf: "I want to be able to read the special writing that goes with it."
W: "Get smarter."
"special writing" ?
He's referring to my Base-64 encoding of 6-bits per character. It starts with digits Zero (0) through Nine (9), then does UpperCase 'A' through 'Z', lowercase 'a' to 'z', then last just Dot '.' and UnderScore '_' (which I've started experimenting with calling "Low-Bass", like a SubWoofer's deep rumbling, but a bit bitter because my Sub stopped functioning this past Week and I quite miss it).
Ah.   Thank you.
He's got the first Zero '0' through '31' down on his left-hand, which includes most of the UpperCase AlphaBet already too, only needing a right-hand finger to catch "W, X, Y, and Z" before he'll start incorpor8ing into his muscle and mind memoriz8ion the lowercase letters (technically as number-base digits throughout many Octology uses). He's doing gr8, as an enthusiastic and persistent learner.  üòä
Xcellent.
Wolf: "Mm hm."
Do you have a regular employment Wolf ?
Wolf: "No, I don't. I have been laid-off from work for a lot of Years already. I get SocialSecurity."
Do you wish to become "laid-on" ?
Wolf: "I wish I could go back to work. I love work."
Doing ?
Wolf: "I wish I could go back to doing what I used to do. Hard work. Hard labor. Making vinyl-plastics again would be what I'd most like to return to doing."
Wolf: "... or a Fork-Lift driver."
Have you applied anywhere recently for either of those ?
Wolf: "I know how to drive those Ryder trucks, but they won't let me have a license."
And -- why is that ?
Wolf: "Because I am declared 'incompetent', by law."
Based on ?
Wolf: "Psychiatrists."
What do they know   ?!?!?
Wolf: "Exactly! I believe I'm 'very competent'."
I have declared you competent.
Tell 'em I said so.
Wolf: "Haha. All right. Thank you."
     And go get a fork-lift job Wolf.
Why do you laugh ?
     Do you think I am not competent to call you competent ?
Wolf: "I can't get a full-time job because I'm on SocialSecurity. I can get part-time work."
Wolf: "Hmm."
I am on SSA too.   But I can work 3 hours per week -- or 93.
What is different about you ?
Wolf: "I have a bad back. That's because of the hard LakeSide Plastics work I did. Destroyed my back. Repetitious disease is what they called it."
That has nothing to psychiatrics.   That is physical.   I'm confused here.
/to/  /to do with/
Wolf: "It's hard to explain."
W: "... at the moment."
Ok.   So don't bother.
Do you wish to be employed ?
Wolf: "Yes, I do. I would very much love to get another job, part-time."
And -- you are doing what about that ?
Wolf: "To be honest, nothing at the moment... but I'm looking forward to getting something, getting some money."
Now I'm confused again.     Do you want to be employed -- or do you want more money ?
Wolf: "Hmm. I would love to get a job working in a restaurant, but right now with the CoViD, it's hard to get a job. I would be a dish-washer, if I could get the chance."
Ok.   I accept that answer.   But ...
     when we are through with this covid gift -- ye shall 
     expect I shall have more Qs for thee.
Ok ?
Wolf: "I don't know how to run a cash-register."
What does Axiom #23 say ?
Wolf: "I don't remember. I read it, but then I erased it because you asked me to."
Good.
Write it down now please -- and keep it forever.
 
Axiom #23:
                      Not knowing how to do something
                      -- doesn't mean I can't.
Axiom #23.
Wolf: "Why? You told me to erase it! If you hadn't told me to erase it, I would have it."
You now have it -- because you *need* it.
Wolf: "It seems like a contradiction to me. Did you want me to not have it? Writing it again is not easy. You could send it to my e-mail and I could get it on my phone again, if you want me to have it."
 
When my grandfather gave me my first Axiom
-- I asked if I could also have the whole
list of his Axioms.
 
He said: "No my boy."
 
"The Axioms are each to be given --
at the moment that they are *needed*."
Wolf: "When do you know when they're needed, when you don't have 'em?!"
 
You said: "I don't know how to run a cash-register."
 
This told me that you needed to have Axiom #23.
 
So -- I gave it to you.
 
As you write it down -- it is now yours forever.
 
But (as my grandfather told me) you are not to
give it to anyone else -- until: you see that
they *need* it.
Wolf: "All things aside, how was your Week?
W: ' " '
I'm sorry.   What does "all things aside" mean ?
     I've never used that term -- because I don't know what it means.
Wolf: "Hmm. I was just making ah, convers8ion."
What does Axiom #8 say ?
Wolf: "Answer: No (bad folks) not included, I was just making convers8ion. I don't remember Axiom #8. I will look it up when I get home."
 
You don't have it ?
     Good.  Write it down please.
Wolf: "I have it. I just have to read it when I get home."
 
        Axiom #8:
the  Beginning
of    Communication
is     Definition.
                  Axiom #8.
Wolf: "Okay. Now I got'cha."
Good.
You now should have a total of 2 Axioms:     # 23  and # 8.
Wolf: "I just got again all the ones Pip has."
I'm sorry.
Apparently I have not been clear about this.
Pip's Axioms are Pip's Axioms.
Wolf's Axioms are Wolf's Axioms.
Wolf: "I don't understand. Please explain."
You are to share one of your Axioms with another person -- when you have determined that they *need* it.   Not before.
Pip is to share one of his Axioms with another person -- when he has  determined that they *need* it.   Not before.
And -- the same goes for me.
Wolf: "These convers8ions help my reading a lot. I have noticed that."
This is what Farfar (my grandfather) told me.
I see that you just said:
                "I just got again all the ones Pip has."
This is not right.
You should have 2 Axioms.
Pip should have about a dozen (I think).
13
Axioms are to be received *when they are needed* -- not before.
Wolf: "Well then I call my Axioms 'life', because that's what I learn by."
13 is *about* a dozen.
Wolf: "Baker's Dozen! Haha."
It is not up to me -- to remember how many who has.
Wolf: "I'll still read Pip's Axioms, because he's my friend and I want to know all the ones he has."
Wrong.
Wolf: "I call it 'knowledge'."
I do not have any control over who does what with what I share with them.   ‚Ä¢   Not should I.
I'm just saying that Pip -- when he shares *his* whole list of Axioms -- with another person -- *is not* sharing them -- as Grandfather specified.
And now -- you (Wolf) also know that too.
You should have only 2 Axioms, Wolf.
Sure, I am sharing them as specified. They're all *needed*, to be evalU8d together for any purported or presumed value (i.e., hardly any, so far... far). My own personal *needed* threshold is sufficiently met by mere curiosity, continuity, and context... essentially alone.
Wolf: "I have thousands."
Maybe also: "cohesion" (or lack thereof).
Wolf: "You did call me 'FarFar'... so I have thousands!"
Wouldn't you say something like: "Even Pip sharing all 13 Axioms he has at once, based on his own determin8ion of *need*, is simply *perfect*"? Yet another "gift", which you claim you too should be outwardly thankful for? There are "no accidents" in *your* Universe, or some-such, eh?
When I violate a suggestion from my grandfather -- it is perfect.
     It is not an accident.
He knew I would do that -- and it cannot wreck his plan.
     It is perfect.
And -- my choosing to violate his suggestion -- will become a teaching to me.
All is perfect.
Wolf: "I'm not perfect... by far! I make mistakes."
Pip is perfect.
Wolf is perfect.
They are both my sons -- and I love them.
I'm quite flawed in so many ways. Not perfect either. Your definition (or assumption) and usage of "perfect" is ironically terribly imperfect by itself already. You assert that quite faulty things (and people) are pure, perfect, flawless, etc. but you're quite off the mark insisting on this sort of easily refutable assertion, declar8ion, pronouncement... at least as I see it, so far.
Excellent.    
     More shall be reveeeled. 
Okay Dad. It's time for me to drive Wolf home. We both need to get some sleep soon. Thanks for the chat tonight. I love you. Can we plan on chatting again next FriDay Evening around our usual time?
Works for me.

How was you weekend?

Let me try again.  üòâ
  "How was your weekend?"
Quite ok.
I'm glad.
Mine was quite okay too.
     The Spring weather has finally arriven !!
I slept a lot. Yeah. I'm very glad that Spring weather is here too!
I was going to ask how yours was -- but I'm too late on that one.
     Thank you for answering it.
That's fine. You're welcome.
Beppu-san is probably coming to visit me next week and should be staying for just over a week. I'm very much looking forward to that and him meeting Wolf. Wolf isn't with me to chat with you tonight, but probably can be again this Friday evening.
I think Beppu-san is flying in next Tuesday, March 30th, then is flying back out to L.A. 8 days later.
Any chance you could come visit during that time too? It'd be gr8 if the 4 of us could spend time chatting together in-person, but I understand if you still aren't vaccin8d and remain reluctant to travel.
That's great Pip.
You & John are long overdue for a visit.
Yeah.
I seriously hope I can convince him to be my roomm8 again, either back in L.A. together, or here in Oshkosh. Either would be so much better for me than living alone here.
Has he given you any indication that that might be a possibility ?
(in Oshkosk) ?
"osh"
Not much. He probably won't be willing to, but I aim to try to see what might persuade him to become amiable to the idea.
Is his current employment based in a particular location ?
It doesn't seem so. He can probably live almost wherever he'd like to for now.
Well -- that's a point in your favor -- I'd think.
Yeah. I hope so.
How far away do you see your plan to return to Cali -- at the moment ?
It's not seeming as likely to return to Cali this year as I'd like it to be. Maybe unfortun8ly a bit more likely that I'll have to remain in Oshkosh another year than the chances that I'll be able to return to L.A. by August (when my lease here in Captain's Cove will end).
Hmm.
I've only been to Wisconsin twice -- and both times were in the summer.
Would I ever consider living there year-round ?
Apparently the house next to Wolf on Frederick Street is open for rent, but the landlord there is asking $675 / month, which is probably a bit too expensive for me to afford. It would probably have been nice to live next-door to him, if I should have to remain here another year.
Can't imagine any situation that would induce such an inclination.
The Winters here in Wisconsin are probably worse than usual Winters in Pennsylvania.
Although being nearer to your firstborn son might make it worthwhile for you to endure somewhat worse Winters.  üòä
No "probably" about it.
Wisconsin winters are flat-out "brutal" -- compared to Pennsylvania.
Yeah.
Is there anything you'd like to discuss tonight?
Sure.
You.
Okay. Ask away.
Do you feel that you are moving forward ?
In some ways, yes. I'm continuing to work on Octology and beginning to teach Wolf about it. He's thankfully eager to learn.
If I must remain in Oshkosh, hopefully much of the time can be spent well preparing to survive and thrive back in Southern California when the time is right to return to there.
What do you see that "preparation" to include ?
I'm not so focused on producing video content for multiple YouTube channels as much as I had during the beginning of the year.
I'm probably just going to focus on JewJesus8 and PedantPip channels, if I keep doing that much.
My "prepR8ion" should include probably saving money and establishing some rel8ively stable additional income to help sustain Darj and me back out West.
Yep.   And what do you see that as being ?
Improving Octology should also be good "prepR8ion".
Probably Patreon p8rons of Octology and maybe my YouTube channels would be the best way some stable supplementary income could be established.
Possible some part-time Perl-development work could fit that bill too. We'll see.
s/Possible/Possibly/;
I've always thought that Perl would be a great revenue generator for you.
But -- I sense quite a bit of reticence for you to go after that.
Am I correct on that ?
     And if so -- why ?
There aren't many Perl-development positions open anymore. Perl's relevance is mostly waning.
Ah so.
Also traditional employment has never been something I've been all that good about maintaining. I often have quite a bit of trouble doing what I'm told to do.
However -- underneath -- you are a computer programmer.   How about the vast possibilities in programming in some other language ?
It's difficult to get a job coding in another language without any professional experience to indic8 that I can do it.
I know I can code in other languages, but hiring managers don't seem as likely to look on me favorably as being capable of coding professionally in some language other than Perl (where the lion's-share of my experience remains).
Well then.   It seems to me that you'll just have to start your own business.
And ideas ?
I've already been out of work for about 11 years. Just getting back into Perl professionally would already be a stretch. Yeah, starting my own business might be one of the best possibilities.
whoops.
Any ideas ?
I'd like to start an Octology company. Selling both software and hardware could work out. I'm hoping such might come together eventually.
I don't cotton to the "eventually" notion.
What does "cotton" mean?
When someone has a good idea for a new business -- its fire-in-their-belly -- usually propels them to start to make it happen today & tomorrow.
"cotton to"   means "feel comfortable with" or "like".
How is "eventually" different from "make it happen... tomorrow"?
"eventually" normally implies that something will happen -- quite a ways off in the future -- after a rather lengthy series of events have occurred.
Okay... and "... start to make it happen... tomorrow" is not meant as quite a ways off in the future, but much closer temporally then?
If a "rather lengthy series of events" must occur, then they all proceed rapidly?
When I said "today & tomorrow" -- I really did mean -- Monday & Tuesday of this week.   I was actually suggesting -- what are you planning to due today (March 22) and tomorrow (March 23) -- to get your Octology Company on-the-road to producing revenue for you -- extremely soon ?
I have no "extremely soon" plans.
I plan to work on parts of Octology that might become impressive to Beppu-san during his visit. I'm trying to be somewhat productive without the benefit of Amphetamines again. I'm unlikely to be able to get much done toward starting a business literally "today" or "tomorrow". I don't yet have any particularly good idea for a new business. Maybe I will eventually.
Good.
What you just said -- sounds good to me.
Extremely soon (e.g., today) would be rushing things. I'm not prepared for an Octology Company to start producing revenue for me right away.
Get Octology ready for John.
     That sounds like a great idea to me.
Thanks. I will try to. I have just over a week to do so.
Xcellent Philip.
I had another curiosity.
Puedo ?
Yes.
To what do you attribute your recent sleepinesses.
Lack of Amphetamines mainly.
Ah-ha.
I've usually purchased some on Thursdays or Fridays, so am often stimul8d to stay awake Friday evenings to chat with you. Without them, it can be difficult to remain awake after my nightly prescribed Zyprexa (Olanzapine) medic8ions have been taken.
Zyprexa is essentially a depressant ?
Zyprexa is an atypical anti-psychotic. It is normally taken before bed-time, and may cause some drowsiness, but is not technically a depressant.
Well -- where I'm coming from on this is that -- every drug in the world is basically either a stimulant or a depressant.
And -- anti-psychotics are all of the depressant category -- are they not ?
I think technically, they are not.
Go on please.
Educate me.
You probably have a false-dichotomy with every drug being simply either stimulant or depressant. There are probably many more than just those. I'm not certain though. Maybe it can be valid to consider all drugs as either one or the other. Perhaps. I'm not sure.
I was taught that every drug is designed either to turn-on something in the body -- or -- to turn something off.
This made sense to me when I heard it -- as I could not imagine there being a 3rd category.
But -- I'm open to be further enlightened.
Some turn some things on while turning others off. There's probably lots of "gray-area".
           I'm listening.
For what?
Some drugs turn things on while turning others off, hence "gray-area".
More on this thing.
Look up drugs.
Thank you.
Are you ok with Zyprexa making you sleepy ?
No. Zyprexa has many side-effects that I do not like.
Yep.   Every drug does.
I keep asking my Psychiatrist to lower my dosage. I think I'm on 7-times the dosage I probably need to remain mood-stable. He rarely obliges me and lowers the nightly amount.
So -- that sounds like an appropriate goal to me.
Yeah. Getting my dosage lowered is a goal I hold.
Are we talking about Doctor Z here ?
Yes.
Dr. David Zerrien.
We've had these discussions before.
I believe that you are the one who is appointed to educate him.
Maybe. We'll see.
I'm getting pretty tired here. Can we please plan on chatting more again Friday evening around our usual time?
It is your body -- your life -- and your future.
Yeah.
Would you prefer 1700 G / 1600 P instead ?
No, thanks. I think 2000 G / 1900 P will still be the best to shoot for.
Ok.   Your wish is my command.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks Dad. I ‚ù§
you too.
Thank you for tonight.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
Get ready for John.
I will try to.

Happy FriDay Evening Dad. Wolf is with me again. How are you?
Glad you're getting high dude!  üòâ
Happy Kite Day Gentlemen.
Wolf: "Oh, it's Kite Day?! I didn't know that."
Not "getting".
     I live here.
Wolf: "Happy Kite Day back.  üòä
"
Thank you.
     üòä
If you stay "high", how do you even know that you are?
I took pilot lessons in 1984 and 1985.
Whether at an altitude of 30,000 feet -- or only 30 feet off the ground -- there is a definite sense of flying.
And both are high -- compared to almost everyone else.
Yeah. Okay.
Does that answer your question ?
Yep. Thanks.
... welcome.
     üòä
Wolf: "I was only on one airline and one helicopter in my life. One from Orlando, Florida to WisConSin, and the other was in Gallinburg, Tennessee on a helicopter."
You liked them ?
Wolf: "Yes, I did. Very much. I can't wait to do it again someday."
Neat.
I'm trying to think.
My helicopter rides ... hmm.
I think -- more than a half a dozen.
But (probably) less than a dozen.
Airplane rides ?           Uncountable.
Maybe 40.
     Or so.
Cool.
I had my first plane ride at about 5 or 6 years of age.
Of course -- I was not the pilot on that one.
I've probably been on around 32 different airplane flights in my life, and probably only 1 helicopter.
If I remember correctly -- that was probably on TWA -- maybe a tri-star.
Wolf: "I don't remember what airline company my flight was on. Just remember it was from FloRida to WisConSin. Other times, I took the bus."
But -- because it was around 1949 -- it was a prop airplane.
I believe the first commercial jet flew in 1958.
Wolf: "Woooh. A prop-plane!"
The Year Wolf was born!  üòä
Wolf: "Wicked, cool!"
Correct.
So do you do anything special for "Good-FriDay"?
That's April 2nd -- correct ?
Not sure. Thought it might be toDay. You could be right though. I'm not a religious man.
That term always confused me.
I always felt that any day that I woke up still breathing -- was a "good" day.
Wolf: "I'm not religious either. I believe in a 'Greater-Power'."
So -- I've had about 40,404 good Fridays (so far) -- haven't I ?
That's a valid perspective on each Day being sufficiently "good".
Should have, yep.
Whoops.
     I missed the decimal point.
          Better make that 4040 good Fridays (so far)
Maybe it's not so valid as I initially thought, but we probably don't need to squabble about it all that much. Just if you didn't wake, would you even be able to know it? So just plain "good" sort of no-matter-what for as much as you could be concerned with is probably vacuous and simplistically definitional I guess.
Okay. I didn't try to compute it. Taking your word (not very far).  üòâ
Actually -- now that I come to think of it -- the "day" that I wake up -- not  breathing -- will (probably) be my BDE.
Wolf: "BDE?"
However.   I have strayed into an area (here) that you may not agree upon.
Best Day Ever.
Wolf: "Oh. I never thought of it that way."
These 30,000 (or so) "earth" days -- are merely schooling.
They are our preparation for the (endless) BDE.
I've tried to get across to you that this is a ridiculous idea. How can this life on Earth be "school" for an "after-life" which we can know essentially nothing significant about? There's no clear connection between here and there.
If it's the "Best-Day-Ever" and "(endless)", then it sure isn't a "Day".
Wolf: "You talk about schooling. I had the best teachers you could ever want... life."
Possibly -- the day that Yeshua SSS (Surrendered his SkinSuit) -- was designated as "Good Friday" -- because it happened to be the day that his BDE began.
You bring up the "day" definition.
A "Day" is not eternal. Eternity is not a "Day".
If you study the use of that word -- you will discover that it is used in many more ways than just to signify a 24-hour period.
Rarely. It almost never should be used in such imprecise ways, as far as I can tell.
The (most) essential meaning of the word "day" is ::: "a period of time".
If you wish to campaign for the "shouldness" of the usages of given words in our languages here on earth -- I say:  "fine with me".
I'd say the most essential meaning of the word "Day" would be: "the time in which the Earth makes a single complete rot8ion about it's axis (along its much longer Year-long orbital path around our Sun [star])". Seems much better (and more corresponding with the vast majority of usages) to me. Wouldn't you think so too?
But -- until you receive quite a few baskets of votes on what you suggest -- I shall allow the dictionary to broaden my understandings of how my sisters and kids wish to use our words.
I'm mainly a language "descriptivist"... but occasionally get wrapped up in some "prescriptivist" approaches, and lean more toward the latter as I get older, it seems.
You ask:  "wouldn't I think so too ?"
My answer would be -- "essential" -- no.   But I would agree with what you said -- if we're talking about "the most frequently used" meaning -- yes.
"24-hours" could suffice nicely, I'm pretty sure.
Ah. Why then would "a period of time" be better than the most frequently used meaning?
If you'll look back a few cycles here -- I believe you will find that (exactly) what I said was:
The (most) essential meaning of the word "day" is ::: "a period of time".
Yeah. Maybe I misunderstood "essential" or something?
I did not say:    "the most frequently used".
I agree with you on frequency.
Wolf: "In my hitch-hiking Days, a 'Day' was just getting from one spot to another."
I guess I tend to consider "most frequently used" to be predominantly consistent with "most essential", but you meant the latter differently.
And -- are you then saying that in your hitch-hiking adventures -- that some "days" were 10 hours -- and some might have been 40 ?
Wolf: "Yes, exactly. Some Weeks."
Got it.
Yes.   Any given endeavor -- can validly be referred to as "a day".
Last Year, right before Good FriDay, I pulled together 3 crosses of Octology. YesterDay, I took a picture of the largest one spanning all 4 of my displays. Maybe you'd like to see it here? Might need to zoom some to see and read it.   HTTPS://Photos.App.Goo.gl/Hc6nB2LkTFSU8HQQA
My "Skylines Corporation" day  started on April 3rd of 1984 -- and did not end until 1991.
I'm pretty sure most "endeavors" cannot be "validly" referred to as a "Day". Too many endeavors would make no sense to call a "Day".
That was the period of time in which I was involved with the development of that company.
Why not say something more coherent and comprehensible, like just "period"?
Day mainly means 24-hours. Why confuse things pointlessly?
If you wish -- you may.
Both Philip and Angie were (also) somewhat involved in the development of Skylines Corp.
Pip was about 8 when he started helping.
Ange -- a bit less.
How did I help?
Thank you for the photo Pip.
You're welcome. I hope you like some of it. I've written code to gener8 it from the around 1,391 words I've collected in my 8.utf file in Octology. Enjoy!
Wolf is probably going to start studying that soon too.
Wolf: "Not probably. I'm going to! I'm going to know everything that you [Pip] want me to know."
Sorry.   When I went over to see your pic -- I lost Gmail.
But I'm back now.
     About the photo -- I have some questions.
Puedo ?
Wolf has already mastered binary coding on his hands of all the numbers and the UpperCase letters of my Base-64 encoding. He's a dedic8d and diligent and enthusiastic learner. I'm probably a pretty rotten teacher, so far... but will hopefully improve over time.
Yes, proceed.
Good for you Wolf.
Wolf: "I have a genius for a teacher."
Please teach  Pip that he is not a "rotten" teacher.
     Thank you Wolf.
Wolf: "And a genius I will become."
No Wolf.
You are already.
Wolf: "Thank you."
You shall only  become   geniuser !!
Pip ... all 4 screen are Octology -- yes ?
Sort of. There's one super-massively large Gnome-Terminal applic8ion window which is stretched to span most of all 4 screens at once. Because the monitors are offset, it can be rather challenging to see quite how they should be lined up together, but it still should convey a lot as-is, for anyone who cares to look closely.
In that terminal is the output of an Octology command called: `8plc` (for Pre-cursorLetterCounter).
GOP.
Actually it is output from the `8plc a` command, where the 'a' parameter design8s computing All the different processing types. The 3 crosses that lined up with Good FriDay of last Year were in the 80-column, 160-column, and 240-column forms of crafted results.
If you ran Octology, you could execute `8plc a` yourself, and should be able to see nearly identical results locally.
Understood.   Thank you.
You're welcome.
üòä
I ‚ù§
 you.
Thanks for checking it out. I think it's one of the best things I've ever made.
I keep trying to ‚ù§
in general, and to ‚ù§
you specifically.
What was another one ?
`ckm8`
`ftst`
`tsgr`
`reso`
You can see many of those in my GitHub Octology repository under the screen-shots ~/gfx/sho/ sub-directories. They're slick too.
Good.   Thank you.
You're welcome.
Well is there anything on your PotentialChatAgenda, or do you have any further questions for Wolf tonight?
Yes.   But first -- I'd like to answer a question of yours Pip.
Ok ?
Yep.
Good.
Thank you.
Give me a couple of minutes to get the text together please.
Ok.
I'm ready.
Cool.
Here it comes.
 
Pip - you asked:  "How did I help ?"  
(in the development of Skylines Corp).
 
This tells me that you (probably) don't
recall a whole lot from your involvement
back then.
 
So -- to refresh your memory -- and to bring
Wolf up to an understanding of what we're
talking about here -- I shall share a bit
of the background of Skylines -- and then
more on to Pip's initial helperies.
 
Skylines was a business idea which my Father
gave to me at 6:37 in the morning -- on
Tuesday, April 3rd of 1984 -- while I was
out on my morning jog -- running northward
on the eastern side of Reseda Boulevard --
in Tarzana -- just about a quarter of a
mile north of the Ventura Freeway.
 
The idea was simple enough.
 
Skylines was going to put laptop computers
on commercial airliners -- on a rental basis.
 
Today (in 2021) this sounds pretty silly --
because nearly everyone owns their own laptop
(or tablet) or whatever.
 
But back then -- a lot of people had no idea
what a laptop even was -- much less: own one.
 
Anyway -- we (Skylines) planned to rent people
a laptop -- while they were in the air.
 
The very first application that we were offering
was "word-processing".
 
Of course -- we also knew that very few of the
people in the world knew how to operate a
word-processing program.
 
So.  We put together a 40-minute lesson to teach
them how to do it.
 
We decided to test the lesson on about 30 people
who had no knowledge of how to do word-processing.
 
Philip was one of the 30 people.
 
Philip was 8 years old.  We figured that would
be a nice added feature to our testing.
 
It was.
 
He did great !!
 
(//)
Thanks Dad. Both Wolf and I found that interesting to have you tell it.  üòä
You're welcome.
It was an exciting time in my life.
And -- you and Ange were excellent assistants.
üòä
Well, we're probably going to start wrapping things up here on our end for the night then. I probably want to take Wolf home soon. Can we please plan to chat again next FriDay Night (which should be "Good FriDay")?
Sounds like a plan.
Actually -- 2 plans.
(1)  reconvene next Shabbat.
(2)  make sure Wolf gets his "beauty sleep".
Thank you both for tonight.
I ‚ù§
 you                                   both.
You're welcome. Thank you too.  ‚ù§
You're welcome too.
Oh -- just one more thing :::
Yep?
Wolf: "I don't need beauty-sleep. I'm already handsome!  üòâ
"
lol
Sorry.   My mistake Wolf.
Goodnightall.
Stamp me Pip ?
Cute image text. We both chuckled.  üòä

Happy After-Easter MonDay Dad.  üòä
1'04-05-21 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Greetings Philip & Company.
Beppu-san: "Heh. He found me. Tell him I say: 'Hi.'  üòä
"
Hello to you John.
üòä
Wolf: "I met John. We get along good. We go to the gym in the morning together and work-out."
Xcellent Wolf.
I have not met John yet.
But if Pip likes him -- I like him.
So how was your past week and Easter weekend Dad?
Interesting.
Wolf: "I don't eat candy. I eat sushi!  üòâ
"
Nice.
Learned.
Thank you for asking.
And yours ?    And yours ?    And yours ?    
I especially like Reese's Peanut-Butter candy. Yep, especially Reese's Pieces.  üòä
Quite good.
I'm a "fish" guy too, Wolf.
But I don't care for sushi.
It has been excellent having Beppu-san here. I wish he could stay longer, but we've had a very nice time visiting together and being productive on our respective projects during his stay.
I (also) am a Reese's nut.
Good on yas.
I'm happy 4 ya.
So glad he and Wolf get along well. He got to meet my good friend, Nate, yesterday too.
                               Grreat.
Nate is your "Madison" friend ?
Nah. We met back in Appleton but have mostly been close friends for the entire almost 6 Years I've lived down here in Oshkosh.
I meant:  he is someone your go to the "Madison Games" with -- yes ?
/your/  /you/
Nope. I went with Mike Lopresti and Luke and Wesley down to the Go (Baduk, Wei-chi) game nights in Madison a few times back in 2019. Almost everyone just plays online now, instead of in-person.
I see.
     I am now straightened out.
          Thank you.
Darjeeling came from Madison originally though. That's where Angie found her.  >~..^<  *purr-meow*  ‚ù§
               Ah yes.              I remember Darj.
                               I think I remember Angie too !!
‚ù§
So John --
     Where all have you gone this past week ?
          And done what ?
Wolf: "I'm buffing up. I'm going to be going to the gym a lot. Now that I know it's close to where I live. At 63, I'm doing okay."
How far from your crib, Wolf ?
We've hardly gone anywhere. Just mostly to the grocery stores and a couple fast-food drive-throughs. Beppu-san has gone to the Public Library here a few times, since he has had some troubling difficulty breathing well in my smokey apartment.
If I'm remembering correctly -- you are only 63 (ANB) -- not fully.
     Yes ?
Wolf: "Yep. Indeed."
I didn't know that the Osh Library had oxygen equipment.
The Reading PA Library doesn't.
Heh.
               Is this the one, John ?
Yep.
It is not as old as our (Reading PA) library -- but it appears to be considerably larger.
Yeah. Ours is quite spacious and has a fine selection of reading material and study spaces.
Glad to hear it.
It is my belief that libraries are the most important institution that we have.
When I was very young -- my father said:
I'd say plumbing is more important!  üòâ
Tithing is a good thing.
But give your money to a library -- not a (so-called) church.
I highly doubt tithing is a good thing. Why did your father think so?
I agree Pip.
Plumbing is very good too -- but --
not a very useful place to put your spare change !!
We asked him that too.
He said:  Why do you think tithing is not  a good idea ?
Then electricity, heating, and internet would be my next concerns, if these are even "institutions". Maybe they're not really in the category with Libraries.
My recent thinking about numbers is increasingly indic8ing that decimal numbers are evil. Our whole number-systems are stupid, backwards, and severe hindrances to our capacity to comprehend logic, reason, quantities, values, math, measurements, rel8ionships, approxim8ions, etc..
I'm going to work to deprec8 and decim8 decimal not8ion.
Hmm.
GOP.
Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal, Base64, Base128, Base256, etc. would be vastly superior for comput8ion and represent8ion of phenomena which arise in n8ure.
Wolf: "I can't w8 to get good at it, learning more of Octology."
Wolf said that I'm a gr8 motiv8or for him.  üòä
           Good Pip.
You are also a hefty motivator for your Dad.
He might be the first person beyond me who learns to appreC8 Octology as a found8ion and advantageous new system of cognition, represent8ion, memoriz8ion, categoriz8ion, and organiz8ion. We're planning to buy PineBook64Pro laptops for Wolf to become able to learn as much of Octology as possible.
     But then --
Thanks, Dad.
          you probably knew that.
You're welcome.
     Thank you.
          üòä
I wish some parts of Octology could have already motiv8d you to learn how gr8 much of it is. You've had almost 8-Years of opportunity, but have seemed either incapable or disinterested in comprehending even the more basic aspects of it. You've hardly asked any questions or shown curiosity or recognition of breakthroughs I've made there.
Wolf is already quite excited to learn about Octology mechanisms for diverse coloriz8ion capabilities.
I am expecting Wolf to teach it to me.
Maybe he will.
Wolf: "If I get good enough and I have the chance, yes... I will."
Maybe he can author a MicroSoft Windows-style manual that you've suggested you'd most need to become capable of discovering Octology's capabilities. We'll see.
               That sound very good to me.
                                       Do it Wolf.
Wolf: "I even dream about learning Octology in my sleep."
/sound/  /sounds/
Anything else on anyone's PCA for tonight ?
I guess I'd like it if you could try to appreC8 some component of Octology soon.
Wolf: "Well, the weather's getting hot. I h8 the heat!"
Anything on your PCA for tonight?
I love the heat.
Wolf: "I need to find somewhere to swim."
I love the heat too.
My apartment in Tarzana had a pool.
I remember.
     I lived there 7 years.
          And used the pool bunches.
Yes, Pip -- I would think you would.
For John and Wolf :::
I was in #128 in that 60-unit complex.
If you walked straight out my front door --
I most remember the minE8ure N.Y.Islander's blue and Ranger's red hockey-sticks that we'd play against the chair-pillow goals in your living-room there.  üòä
and didn't make any turns for 3 more steps --
you had just fallen into the shallow end of the pool.
Yep. Cool that your unit-number was 2^7th power.
Yes.   We did love our hockey back then.
Yes.     Want to know another cool apartment number ?
Yeah.
Ok.
See who can get this answer first.
What is the lowest number (above 1000) -- that has 30 factors ?
1200?
Nope.
Lower please.
1080?
Nope.
     Lower please.
Wolf: "I'm not that fast at the numbers yet. I'm just starting to learn."
Good Wolf.
     Keep practicing.
          You're get there.
1024?
Good try.
     Lower please.
I give up.
Pip's Dad has lived at this address for more than 20 years now.
Wolf and Pip: "Okay."
üòä
üòä
Ready for another riddle ?
Okay.
Good.
     Here we go.
Wolf: "What was Dorothy of the Wizard of Oz's middle-name?"
  
What did the one hat 
say to the other hat ?
"What are you doing hanging around like that?"
That's certainly a possible.
But I had another response in mind.
 
You stay here.
I'll go on a-head.
Ah. Hehe.
                   üòä
Thank you very much.
I've got 3 more items on my PCA.
First 1.
Puedo ?
Wolf: "What's the answer to my trivia question / riddle?"
What was Dorothy of the Wizard of Oz's middle-name?
You don't need to ask "Puedo?" first to just redundantly request permission to ask another question. Just ask away, when you're ready.
Ellen ?
Wolf: "Nope. Try again."
Theodore ?
Wolf: "Give up?"
Eye                                                                        give up !!
Wolf: "Gail."
Hmm.
I don't get it.
           Help ?
Wolf: "That was her middle-name. Dorothy Gail."
I'd like your source for that please.
Wolf: "It was in the movie. Wizard of Oz."
Wolf: "When she met the Wizard, before the cyclone."
I understand that part -- yes.
But I thought that her last name was Gale. 
I did not know her middle name --
Wolf: "That was her middle-name. She never said her last-name."
but now -- after looking it up -- my source says --
that here middle name was Louise.
/here/  /her/
Wolf: "No, it wasn't. It was Gale. Dewey had the original script of the movie."
Ok.     You probably have better teachers than I.
We'll go with your say-so.
üòä
Wolf: "I had the best.  üòä
"
Who is Dewey ?
Wolf: "He was like my second Dad."
Ah yes.
     I remember now.
          Thought I heard that name from you before.
üòä
Wolf: "He taught me a lot."
Yep.   I remember that you had said that too.
That's good, Wolf.
Ok.
Here's my next PCA.
Weather
 
Well (maybe) spring is over.
And winter has returned.
Friday was in the mid-30s
for most of the day.
(//)
Wolf: "I would thrive in that... in shorts and a t-shirt!"
You may have it, young man.
Here is my next PCA.
 
Apparently, we are far from finished
with Covid.  One of my close friends
(and her husband) contracted it this
past week.
 
For (about) 10 years now -- I have been
attending 2 or 3 parties (per year) at
their home in Fleetwood -- about 8.57
miles NNE of my crib.
Yeah. CoViD-19 keeps infecting, unfortun8ly.  üòû
   
But -- for the past 12 months
-- I have been on a sabbatical.
  
Which -- I don't foresee
ending anytime soon.
(//)
Wolf: "Are you ready for another riddle?"
I am.
               Send it please.
Wolf: "What has 4, then 2, then 3?"
I don't know.     Well John -- What has 4, then 2, then 3?
        Pip -- What has 4, then 2, then 3?
A man... as a babe, adult, then elderly with cane.
Or just a grossly oversized old-man's penis (3rd-leg)!  üòâ
Hmm.
Wolf: "It's the riddle of the Sphinx."
The Sphinx ?
Wolf: "It was in the show: 'Egyptian Gods'."
I guess I missssed that one.
üòä
Well I think it's probably time to wrap our chat up for tonight. I'm going to drive Wolf home.
Wolf: "I had fun chatting with you."
I've got one more.
May I send it ?
Beppu-san will probably be flying back to California Wednesday.
Yeah, go ahead.
Thank you.
I will send it.
     Have a safe trip John.
     Come again soon.
Beppu-san is sleeping out in the living-room right now, but I'll try to remember to tell him your words when he's awake again.
Ok.
Thank you.
Here is my last item for this evening.
 
Saturday morning (April 3, 2021)
(to my great delight) I discovered
a form of gymnastics, of which I
had not (heretofore) been aware.
 
The name of this event was "The 36th
Rhythmic Gymnastics" -- which occurred
in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2018.
This style of gymnastics is
(basically) what is (commonly)
referred to as a "floor exercise"
-- in that it uses no kind of fixed
apparatus, such as a beam, or bars,
or whatever -- but it *does* include
some sort of auxiliary device(s).
 
The 4 standard apparati are:
     ‚Ä¢ a hoop
     ‚Ä¢ a ball
     ‚Ä¢ 2 batons
     ‚Ä¢ a 6-meter (19.7-foot) ribbon
 
Although this You-Tube video is 3:33:52 in total
length -- and all of its 24 contestants are extremely
talented -- the one which I found to be (absolutely)
beyond belief, was the very first one:  20-year old
Dina Averina, from Russia, who performed with the hoop.  
This You-Tube video is 3:33:52 in total length --
and although there were 24 contestants in the entire
competition -- this one contains only 12 of the girls
-- each doing all 4 disciplines -- for a total of 48
presentations.
 
When I watched the very first one:  20-year old
Dina Averina (from Russia) who performed with the
hoop -- I found her routine to be (absolutely)
beyond belief !!
Wolf: "Yes, I've seen it before. One of Dewey's students was a rhythmic-dancer, in GreenLake, WisConSin. It's a very beautiful art."
 
All throughout her exercise
             -- my mind was saying:
                            "How is that even possible ?!"
 
I wrote up the (above) of this before I had
watched any of the other 47 exercises.
 
However -- as good as Dina was (and she *was*)
-- I was soon to learn that every one of the
other 11 contestants (in this video) were
extremely talented also.
 
Certainly -- many of the others were quite polished
in their individual arts -- but Dina was the one who
absolutely "took my breath away" !!
 
I could have (easily) made notes on a couple dozen
more -- but I decided that you can watch it -- and
see for yourself some of the mind-boggling things
that these girls have taught their bodies to do.
 
However -- (below) I have cited 2 more
which mesmerized me pretty substantially!
Cool.
 
I also found it interesting that: the 3 which
I (especially) have called attention to --
ended up winning the 3 top medals.
 
And -- I wrote this up (before)
I knew who the winners were !!
Wolf: "That's cool."
 
0:06:22 - hoop  - Dina Averina                  (Russia)  GOLD
1:54:37 - ball    - Aleksandra Soldatova  (Russia)  BRONZE
2:10:17 - ball    - Linov Ashram                (Israel)     SILVER

Did you get to go to Greenlake to see her, Wolf ?
Have we lost our connection ???
Well -- thank you gentlemen for tonight's chat.
I ‚ù§
 you all.
Is it time for you to stamps me Pip ?
1'04-05-21 - 2209 Gtime / 2109 Ptime
Yeah. We were just watching the dancing.
Let's plan on chatting again FriDay evening at our usual time.
L45MLBox
Ok.
‚ù§
you too Dad.

Thank you Pip.

Hello. Happy FriDay Dad.
5'04-09-21 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
 
Shabbat shalom gentlemen.
 
                      2008 - age 8
Just me here tonight. Beppu-san flew home WednesDay, and Wolf went back to his apartment after we ate Salv8ionArmy lunch together.
Ok then.
     Thank you.
          Correction follows.
Shabbat shalom gentleman.
Thanks. I guess I hope you have a peaceful weekend of rest and relax8ion too. I'm not too keen on "Sabbath" as a good concept right now. I seriously doubt it (or just about anything else, for that matter) is "Holy".
Did I say "sabbath" ?
No. I did. You say "Christ" is the same as "Messiah" (which I disagree with pretty vociferously). I assumed "Shabbat" was sufficiently close enough to "Sabbath". Care to please distinguish them, if they're meaningfully distinct somehow?
I don't think I said "Christ" this evening either.
Nor did I mention "holy".
     Are you reading a page that I am not aware of ?
You're an aphasia sufferer (i.e., mute)... so you probably don't "say" anything.
I think about things that you have not said.
Is that some surprise?
Did you call to fight ?
Fuck yeah!
Let's fight!
Count me out please.
Suit yourself.
I'll be w8ing.
Have I done (or said) something to put you in a bad mood.
?
Please forgive me.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Even when you are angry.
You can do nothing to get out from under my love for you.
üòä
Yes. You've routinely done (and typed) things that adversely impacted my mood. Most of those are vague memories, at the moment... but we're just getting started tonight.
I will try to forgive.
You may need to do some of the leg-work though.
What leg-work do you propose ?
Learn to follow your own advice and ask more poignant questions. Get to know me. Learn Octology. Take my critiques of your 27-Axioms and 29-Pieces-of-"lite" seriously. Engage... or get bent.
Thank you.
     I am bent at the moment.
Does that make my presence more acceptable ?
Being str8 (in any sense other than "not gay") is overr8d.  üòâ
Somewhat. I'm bent too.
lol
Usually still better than broken.
Well then -- I guess you are my son.
I 'gree.
üòä
You are my Dad.  üòä
  I will keep trying to love you. Love obviously matters a lot to you (and most people). I'm a weirdo, who can sort of take it, or leave it.
Yes -- you are correct -- "loving" is important to me.     
But not that people love me.     
Only that I am loving to others.
Hmm.
GOP
Grande Olde Partee! Yay.
Yes -- I am having a partee today.
     Did you get the hint that I sent you ?
For what, or who?
I probably missed it. I can be too dense for a lot of hints.
She turns 21 today.
Friday, April 9, 2021.
The picture was the hint.
Are you going to get her drunk?
Not me.
Just cake & ice cream.
I might recommend GHB?
Not sure about her.
GHB ?
Ask Cosby about it.  üòâ
It's a bad joke.
It's probably the most common "d8-rape" drug.
Bill Cosby ?
Yeah. He was accused of using it on many women, then having sex with them while they were potentially essentially unconscious.
I don't believe it.
Bill is my son.
He may not have done much (if anything) he was accused of.
It's cloudy.
The press invents stories that sell papers.
Hive-mind women falsely accuse powerful wealthy men of criminal activities rather routinely these days. False accus8ions are all the rage, apparently.
It's part of Feminism, Women's Liber8ion, and Social Justice... or some such.
... or one's lack of loving their self.
Maybe it's the opposite. Too much self-love (i.e., Narcissism) could do it too.
All bullying is lack of loving the self.
In some ways, you may be right.
Narcissism is a misunderstood word.
I think you're too generous to characterize false-accus8ions about severe crimes as merely "bullying", but I guess it can be an extreme form.
Most words are rampantly misunderstood. I concur.
I'm sorry.     I did not mean that "invented" press stuff was bullying.
Not just words... but they're low-hanging-fruit in regards to misunderstandings.
That's merely about selling papers.
Loving one's self is a learned skill.
         Many are not taught it by their parents.
And many of those who are not -- never get to it.
Many cannot be taught much (if anything).
GOP
Animals (including humans) are stubborn and mostly stupid.
Well.   I don't know about (other) animals.
But -- in the case of the human animal -- I tend to agree with ye.
I suspect God (if it exists) is possibly even more stupid and stubborn than mankind. Could be. Some readily available evidence might support such a hypothesis. I think it's called the "Word" (or something like that).  üòâ
Maybe it's "Qur'an"? I forget.
God expected us to think He was/is stupid.
He even told us to expect ourselves to think that.
How could you know what God expected? It never told me to think that (that I know of yet).
It's in the Bible.
It's ok if we don't believe it.
When did it tell anyone to expect ourselves to think it was/is stupid?
He expected us not to like lots of what He allowed to go in there.
The phrasing seems to imply it isn't stupid, but that we just could be expected to mistakenly think it is.
Good question you just asked.
     Shall I send that passage to you ?
If you care to.
Only if you want it.
I want it.
Ok.
I'll send it.
For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.
I Cor 1:25
Ah. Thanks.
By what metric can "foolishness" be "wiser" than human (or any kind of) "wisdom"? The passage is foolish.
You're welcome.
Actually -- there are about 6 verses that (especially) address that subject.
4 more in I Cor 1
Or it's saying that God's worst is better than our best? That what's foolish for it remains above wise for us. Hmm.
2 more in I Cor 2
GOP
I don't like calling foolishness wise. It's like calling evil good. Stupid! Evil.
It's all about one's perspective.
One's judgment.
God is not easy to comprehend.
Comprehension is almost never easy (for anyone, or anything).
And what we can't comprehend -- must (usually) seem foolish to us.
Probably right.
Yes -- what you just said is true.
And God is far more diphakulter to comprehend that any thing else !!
Until ...
Almost everything I say is true. It's a profoundly fundamental component of my character. "Truth" is close to my highest value.
[applause goes here]
Shall we (now) return to my PCA #1 ?
Were you saying something further with the "Until ..."?
Oh -- yes.                 You noticed that pause.
          üòä
I was going to continue -- but I wasn't sure if now was the right time.
Shall I ?
I notice most things others can't, don't, wouldn't want to, maybe shouldn't, etc.. Go ahead and continue please.
Ok.
Shall do.
I had said:
God is far more diphakulter to comprehend that any thing else !!
I highly doubt God could possibly be more difficult to comprehend than literally "any thing" else. 2 Gods probably would be more difficult than 1, right?
But -- if one really wants to comprehend Him -- and His ways --
there are things that can be done -- in order to assist that greatly.
lol
Good Pip.
I know I am good (usually). Thanks.  üòä
Yes -- multi-theocraies are muchy more difficult.
     You are (very) correct.
theocraies     -- sorry -- missppelled.
But -- you knew what I meant.
No.   You are not usually good.
I may really want to comprehend it  --  and its ways  --  probably in order to eviscer8 it. Maybe embowel, then disembowel, it... if necessary. Life is *not* forever. No eternity. Not for gods or anything that lives. Things don't work properly for life if there exists no permanent death (as far as I can tell).
You are always
        perfect.
But now I've gotten myself in BIG trouble with you again.
You don't know me. I'm almost never perfect. Just somewhat close rather frequently.
I just used 2 words you don't like me to use.
It's okay to st8 what you think.
You can reiter8 it when you think you should.
Thank you.
I try to contend against it, whenever I can and can be bothered to. It probably works itself out eventually.
You are very gracious Pip.
And very loving too.
I doubt those. You're probably seeing rose-tinted me or being overly polite or generous.
Are you telling me you believe I have written untruth ?
I think I can be occasionally gracious and loving, but usually am not best described as those.
I am telling you that I believe you write what you think is true, but when it comes to knowledge or understanding of me, you have a high tendency to miss-the-mark.
I was describing "the moment".
Fair enough. Thanks then.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm proud of you Pip.
Why?
Isn't pride a sin?  üòâ
Because you are true to your self.
Doesn't it cum before a fall, or something like that?!
Good Q.
To be proud of an other -- is not a sin.
To be excessive proud of one's self is the state which needs to be tumbled from -- yes.
You are correct, Pip.
Ah. Cool.
/excessive/  //excessively/
Yes you are Pip  :::
Why is pride in one's self needing a tumble? If others are proud of you for good reasons, what could be wrong about reflecting that proportion8ly?
      kool !!
That's a great question Pip.
Take a shot at it please.
Because the "Bibble" tells me so?
Because God cares about frivolous things?
Annh !!
2 lousy answers.
üòä
Because self-pride blinds necessarily?
Unavoidably?
I'm not sure what you meant by that.
Help ?
Me either. It was a guess.
lol
ok
GOP
Maybe self-pride obscures some truth. Self-knowledge must become clouded (blinding to the clear seeing of self), when pride has entered the equ8ion?
Xcellent Pip.
     My Father could not have said that better !!
üòä
What *can* your "Father" say well? I don't think I've met it.
Well -- I know that I've told you this before -- but --
I'm gonna say it again.
Generally -- we can not prove that God exists.
But --
I see Him in you.
And that nails it for me !!
Say it again then, Dad. Keep saying whatever it is that you believe. Hopefully with reasons, if any... but say (i.e., type) what you think. The meeting of our minds is ultim8ly likely to be (or at least become) a mostly good thing, as I measure it.
What specifically do you "see"?
Thank you for that permission.
How could you recognize an invisible being by sighting parts of it within some visible being?
Another grreat Q !!
I do not believe in the visible.
I believe in the invisible.
Then you probably shouldn't say "see"?
The visible is not about belief.
Are you sure?
There is no need to *believe* in what is *known*.
And the visible is *known*.
Haven't you heard the saying: "Seeing is believing!"  ??
Yes.
And I've also heard:
Not exactly. The visible is perceived by light-sensitive cells of living organisms. "Known" and "seen" are somewhat distinct importantly.
                                 When you believe it -- you'll see it.
Knowing and believing are interrel8d too.
Can you say there's truly no need to believe whatever you claim to know?
What's so sepR8 about them?
When I say that    "I see God in you." -- 
I mean that I see you acting as God is said to act.
Okay. I think we're getting somewhere with this. Sounds decent.
Specifically how is God said to act, by whom that is deserving of any credibility?
God is described in The Bible.
Accur8ly?
And -- from reading that --
I've read several different versions (long ago). Bibles don't impress me much.
we can say 100s of things about how
He is supposed to be.
But above all of the other things --
He is to be loving.
When you act loving --
I "see" Him in you.
Okay.
He is also supposed to be wise.
When you say something wise
(like you did about 20 minutes ago)
-- again -- I "see" Him in you.
I could go on (and on and on)
with these examples.
I feel as though I scarcely love anyone, and I instead h8 a lot! Why might there be such serious mismatch between our perceptions of how loving I am?
Bottom line is:
     I see Him in you, Pip.
(//)
Maybe it and I are similarly "loving" then. I don't think that should settle the matter entirely for you (or "nail" it)... but I guess I understand if you insist that it should, for now.
I see Him in Angie.
Does God h8 more than it loves? I think I often do.
I see Him in Dottie.
I see Him in Wolf.
I see Him in Tim.
Where don't you see it?
Great Q.
It's like all over the fucking place?! What sense does that make about it being presumably remarkable?
I never don't see Him in any person.
So then how is it even worth noting? What point could there be?
I do not have enough faith to not see Him.
If I did -- I would (certainly) be an atheist.
Do you mean "f8h" as "belief without (or beyond) reason or evidence"?
Christians too often confl8 simple trust (which was built up) or belief (normally based on sound reasons) with some assumed to be compatible, or synonymous, "f8h" ... and I suspect you're doing that here too.
Seeing you -- acting like the Bible says that God is to act -- is evidence to me.
But -- I do not believe that that evidence (to me) needs (also) to be taken as proof to anyone else.
Normal belief is based on convincing reasons, while f8h is typically belief in what is merely hoped for, or something at the extent of what some simpleton can imagine, bereft of reasons, evidence, justific8ions, qualific8ions, etc. as I see it.
And I'm glad that you do.
You're saying it would require you to have more f8h than you currently do in order to *not* see God in everyone? How is that?
Good question, Pip.
I believe that we are getting (here) into the subject of "worldviews".
Probably.
My (Gerry's) worldview is based on my (Gerry's) answers to some initial questions.
Is the "God" you see in everyone best understood as simply lovingness or wisdom? Why can't people be loving or wise apart from God? I want to kill all gods. Eternal is *not* life!
Did I make me ?
No.
Did I make the earth ?
No.
To some extent, you have made yourself though.
So?
What does that matter?
Do I know how to orchestrate a sunset ?
No.
I can make an Earth. I probably will make many.
I do.
And these question (of course) are endless.
What does that matter either?
And my every answer is (again):
No.
Not of course. Almost nothing is endless.
So then.
My next question becomes:
Who (or what) did ?
And this answer shapes my (Gerry's) worldview.
Then you simply assume you can know who (or what) did, based on some stupid, evil, ancient, repressive, reprehensible, etc. book?
How do those questions answered "No." even build up to supposed knowledge that some one (or thing) did do all of them?
What is the alternative ?
There are tons of altern8ives.
Ok.
More than one being did them?
Share please.
One being did some, and others were consequences or unintentional or accidental and happenstance?
And that is the basis for your worldview.
I accept that.
Randomness, chance, probability, n8ure, shit... pseudo-randomness (for my programmer friends out there)?
Does my worldview have a basis? What are you referring to?
You said:
"One being did some, and others were consequences or unintentional or accidental and happenstance?"
That is a basis for your worldview -- is it not ?
I don't think it is.
Oh.
Ok.
Straighten me out please.
I don't as myself endless questions about whether I made Earth, can orchestr8 a sunset, etc. answering "No." forever (since the question-list is apparently "endless, of course"). Even if I could conclude an endless list of questions, answering neg8ively to all, this too would not convince me that someone other than me must have done some or many or all of them (instead of me, since I didn't or couldn't).
s/as/ask/;
Ok.
And where does that "set" your worldview ?
I suspect my worldview (or maybe more technically "universe-view") is something like: "Only eternity itself should be absolutely eternal. Let time itself always remain. Everything (including everyone, gods, people, animals, plants, spirits, angels, demons, etc.) else should be, then not be. Live and let die.
Ok.
s/$/"/;
I think I got it.
I don't look at the universe and conclude: "There must have been a gr8 grand Designer!" Nah.
And you are satisfied with that "universal-view" ?
For now, I'm satisfied that it's better than altern8ives I've contempl8d thus far. I often strive to improve upon my universe-view though. It expands and contracts periodically... thankfully. It sort of does something like breathing in rhythm with my body (and mind).
Ok.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Does my description of it clarify anything for you? Can you discern something wrong with it?
When I embrace yours -- I find that -- if it were mine -- I would be sad -- nearly all the time.
Why?
It's not necessarily bad to be sad, but what about my universe-view (if it were yours) would make you sad -- nearly all of the time?
It does not have sweet and happy endings for all the people I care for -- and love.
I don't believe Jesus Christ was real. How much less that he lived, was crucified, then rose from death for my sins. How then would your worldview have sweet or happy ending for me (presuming I'm included in who you care for -- and love)?
My worldview says that you and I get to spend thousands of years together.
Does your worldview say that ?
Probably my universe-view does not say that. If I'm an unrepentant sinner who would far rather kill God and Jesus than worship either, how then could your view say we'll be together?
How you feel about the existence of God -- or if Yeshua ever breathed -- or anything else -- has nothing to do with whether you and I get to spend thousands of years together.
We do -- because my Father and I want it that way.
Period.
I'm pretty sure your Bible says otherwise.
I'm certain my Bible says that specifically.
2 places jump to my mind at once !!
Your Bible says that a blasphemous, f8hless, skeptical, sinful unbeliever who refuses to acknowledge Jesus as Lord or Savior, denying it has any power, authority, or legitimacy... unrepentant, unsaved, un-atoned-for, unforgiven, etc. like me gets to "live" in Heaven for thousands of years with you somehow? I don't think so. I probably only want to live for 64 or 1024 years anyway. Either of those should prove to be enough for me. I intend to get and stay dead after one of those 2 ages has completed. I reject "after-life" and may just have to keep suiciding or something like that, if I can't figure out how to stay dead properly and permanently through some mechanism other than such brute-force trial-and-error.
Ok.
You have your wish.
I have mine.
I'm ok with that.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
What? These are just "wishes" now? How?
You hope you are correct.
I hope I am correct.
Hopes are wishes.
Thanks Dad. I still think you try to love me. You make quite a habit of saying (i.e., typing) that you do. Sometimes you show that you do indeed love me in ways that reson8 somewhat with me... but most of the time, your actions speak louder than your words. You barely know me, or care to ask good questions that would stand a decent chance of enabling you to concertedly get to know me better. Without knowing me well, you can't show me much love that I can recognize, receive, absorb, feel, incorpor8, and appreC8. It's okay though. Love is inessential to me most of the time. It can be nice, but it's tragically overr8d most of the time, as far as I can tell.
Good.
GOP
I think hopes and wishes are sometimes rather interchangeable, and sometimes sepR8 and distinct concepts. Maybe it's mostly fine to confl8 them, even when they ought to be (or especially when they were intended to be) different.
Noted.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Thank you too. I ‚ù§
you Dad.
Yes     you     do.
Thank you Pip.

So how does just "seeing" a person be loving or saying something wise indic8 there's any presence of God? I'm staunchly anti-God. It has no place within my mind or body, if I can loc8 and evacU8 it, by any means necessary. God seems overwhelmingly evil, in the Bibles, in the Churches, in the f8hful, in the gullible... all treacherously a chorus in unison calling the Lord implicitly "good" (by definition). Why can't I be loving or wise, while having little (or nothing) to do with any god? I would somewhat strongly prefer to be either neutral or good, rather than evil (as God probably is, if it exists). So how then can it be seen in me? How can I make it no longer visible in me? Just stop being loving or wise? Might be worth it.
I had to read & re-read that a number of times.
I see 5 (specific) questions.
Let's start with #2.
" Why can't I be loving or wise, while having little (or nothing) to do with any god? "
You can.
You do (be).
However.     
When you do --
you cannot prevent your (earthly) father --
from seeing our (heavenly) Father in you.
üòä
You remind me of Him !!
How is it "our" / my (heavenly) Father? I h8 gods. They should probably die... and I just my be the right guy for the hit-jobs. What would happen to you if I could and did kill your (heavenly) Father?
I have no answer for that. 
Sorry.
Can your Father die?
Is it ready to?
Maybe tell it to make its time. Take off every zig. Somebody set up us the bomb! What you say? All its bass are belong to me, probably in due time.  üòâ

God cannot die.
God is a spirit.
Why not?
Spirits cannot be killed.
Can spirits be destroyed then, even if not the same as dead?
They can be active -- or inactive.
That's all.
How can it reasonably be said that spirits truly live, if they cannot die?
Most people do not understand these 3 words.
And -- that these 3 words are synonyms.
I will deactiv8 every spirit I can then. Maybe I can discover how to deactiv8 any spirit dimension or realm, in its entirety. Seems like they've possessed the living for far too long already.
spirit
inclination
attitude
I have inclin8ion and attitude in spades... but no spirit that I know of.
Love is a spirit. 
Love is an inclination.    
Love is an attitude.
One can yield to it -- or choose not to.
Spirits should probably be deactiv8d. Maybe love too. Inclin8ions and attitudes should probably stick around though. I think so.
Love can be good, or benign, I guess too.
If one chooses not to -- on a very regular basis -- then (effectively) it is dead.
But -- never permanently.
Because -- the person may (at any time) choose differently.
How can you know "never permanently"?
So you say "God is spirit." as some entity that's active. Then you say "Love is *a* spirit." in some different way, or the same? Another active sepR8 spirit being? I can't tell.
No spirit / leaning / inclination / attitude can become un-choosable.
Good.
Spirit should become un-choosable. Deactiv8. Extermin8!
If someone wants to hate -- they can.
If someone wants to not hate -- they can.
Every spirit is subject to the will of the person.
What about possession? How is it not the case that every person is also conversely subject to the will of every spirit? Or only people have wills and spirits don't? I don't think I'm subject to spirit's wills, but maybe I'm alone in that. Seems somewhat likely. Maybe I'm a represent8ive of the dawning of a new spiritless era. I guess we'll see.
2 more great questions, Pip.
Spirits do not have a will.
Only the people can will (choose) to use a spirit -- or not.
If the "eat lunch" spirit nudges you to eat lunch -- it is still up to you (your will)  (your choosing) whether you yield to that spirit -- or not.
How can a spirit nudge without a will?
Great question      !!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's what a spirit is !!
a nudge
a leaning
an inclination
üòä
Why is Wolf convinced his spirit, "Animal", has its own will, knowledge, wisdom, identity, abilities, preferences, etc.? Most people seem to think of spirits as much more than just a nudge or leaning or inclin8ion. Usually people say they have a spirit of their own, and may also variously have their bodies inhabited by other foreign spirits which are not their own.
People confuse words.
Wolf is talking about his angel.
I have not found that it is time to 
Angels are not spirits?
correct him on that.
The concept that he hold works for him.
So -- I do not need to try to disturb that.
/hold/ /holds/
Angels are messengers.
He asserts that he has about 45 total spirits residing within him. Animal is primary. Then there's Bear. Others haven't been named yet. He also refers to them as "Guardian-Angels". He sees spirit, soul, angel, ghost, etc. as all the same, I think.
Spirits are leanings.
Both require the person to decide whether they will use what they are receiving.
Neither angels nor spirits can actually *do* anything -- without the will of a person.
Persons have wills.
Angels do not.
Spirits do not.
Didn't you say God was just a spirit too though? Just a nudge then also, without will?
You have been listening closely, Pi.
That is Xactly what I said.
Yep.
God's will seems to be a pretty prevalent concept though, right?
You've got it (perfectly) correct !!
What do you mean -- when you say:   "prevalent concept" ?
Commonplace idea.
Yes.
And that is also correct.
God has a will.
But He does not force it upon anyone.
Ever.
Your will is your will.
How can God be a spirit, have a will, and spirits not have wills... all at once?
God's will is God's will.
Do ever the twain meet.
??
Sometimes.
Many times     --     NOT !!
That's an excellent question Pip.
Answer is:   because -- when God made you -- He decided not to put His will into you.
I don't understand. Do people have their own spirits (which are just nudges)? How can God be spirit with will, while spirits also don't have wills? How did God make me? I am an animal of n8ure. Nothing literally crE8d me, more than my parents of my same species having insemin8ion through sexual intercourse. I'm not made by any spirit that I know of. What would it making me and deciding not to put its will into me have to do with any of my outstanding questions?
Lots more questions again.
Good for you Pip.
Let's take the first one first.
You asked:
" Do people have their own spirits (which are just nudges)?"
No one *has* a spirit.
That is (as if) an ownership.
Spirits come and go.
Nudges come.
Nudges leave.
Later -- another nudge comes.
And soon -- it also leaves.
Does that answer that one ?
Sorta.
GOP
Why do people think they *are* their own soul or spirit?
Good one Pip.
We must (mostly) blame the lexicographers for that one.
Our dictionaries have a very difficult time with those 2 words.
                  soul              spirit
Our dictionaries tell us that those 2 words are essentially synonyms.
         This is not correct.
Now.       We have already (pretty well) covered "spirits".
     They are leanings / inclinations / nudges / attitudes.
So.
         Let's go after the word  "soul".
Okay.
Have I given you Farfar's Axioms #15 and #16 ?
Checking...
Yes, you have.
Good.
I shall tell you -- what I was told.
You can make up your own mind what the word "soul" really means -- by chewing on those 2 Axioms.
But -- it is very easy to conclude -- that "soul" and "spirit" are *definitely* not synonyms.
One other note -- in #16 the word "save" means "except for".
(//)
I noted that.
I thought you knew that.
But I like to mention it -- because many people are not familiar with that meaning for the word "save" sometimes.
Understood.
üòä
So do souls have wills? Can multiple souls inhabit a single human body?
Nope.
Your soul is yours.
Angie's soul is hers.
Wolf's soul is his.
Can they be sold?
lol
No.
lol
Good one Pip.
lol
Thanks.  üòâ
You're welcome.
Wondered how much they might go for, on the open market? Heh.
Your soul is what remains when your body crumbles.
I've never seen one offered on Ebay.
Souls are immaterial then?
That is correct.
What can they do to matter (i.e., the real physical universe)?
Your soul is what has consciousness.
Your body does not.
That's a rough question.
How can it be known that the body does not have consciousness on its own? It seems to me that almost all living animals (and probably insects too) have consciousness as a direct consequence of their bodies and biological structures. Do all animals and insects have souls, according to your understanding?
I'm not sure that I can accurately answer that Q.
You affect matter by means of your will.
My will is matter too, I expect.
This is commonly referred to as you will making choices.
No -- your will is not matter.
Your will affects matter.
I see consciousness and will as products of the material which comprises my body and mind. Matter moving matter.
But it is not matter.
What is will, if not matter?
A product of soul?
How does soul and will manipul8 a material body? What could be the interface between the supposedly immaterial and the clearly physical reality?
Eat a banana ?         Eat an apple ?
This is a choice for you.
Banana then.
Your will decides.
What is a choice made of ?
What is your will made of ?
Selection among options.
Is your will of substance ?         Of physicality ?
My will is a product of my body and conscious mind. I'm pretty sure all must be made of real matter.
Yes.
I think it must be.
There's no proof I know of indic8ing that anything exists which is utterly insubstantial, or non-physical.
Well this gets into something that I had shared with you previously -- which you did not cotton to.
I said:
Your brain is not your mind.
When your brain crumbles -- you mind remains.
It can be minuscule, diminutive, conceptual, abstract, very challenging to localize or describe structurally when deeply internal to the body and mind, hard to delinE8 clearly, but I expect it must all be physical in some fundamental way.
Our choices are made in our mind -- subject to our will.
I didn't think my brain could be my mind. Brain is way too small to hold my mind, I'm pretty sure.
Good.
I'll go with that -- absolutely Pip.
My intuition suggests that my mind and body are almost identical (in most ways).
I would not go along with that at all.
Why not?
The decomposition of your skinsuit -- will not take your mind with it.
I expect it would have to. What evidence has there ever been that any mind has ever stuck around, beyond decomposition of its corresponding body? None, I'm pretty sure.
On the button Babe !!
Evidence  =  0.
Decomposing bodies (much more than a mere "skin-suit") don't leave detectable minds lingering on afterward. They go "hand-in-hand" I think. Mind mostly equals body, for me.
First -- let's get clear on one thing -- when I use the word "skinsuit" -- I really mean -- "the entire body" -- not just the outer covering.
Ok ?
Okay. It just is a poor term for the entirety.
You're right.
It is.
What's wrong with "body"?
But I use it to wake people up.
I doubt it could wake anyone.
You haven't been to my Seminars.
lol
Alarms or sirens... or vigorous yelling and shaking by the shoulders usually do a better job interrupting slumber.  üòâ
So.   I believe "mind" pre-dates, and post-dates -- body.
And you do not.
That's ok.
No surprise to me.
Ah. Yeah.
Why could you believe mind pre-d8s and post-d8s body, with admittedly zero evidence?
Solely predicated on a belief in God.
     Of course -- there is no other way.
There might be other ways, but they'd probably be similarly unlikely and untenable.
Ok.   I'll say "yes" to that.
Can you please ask your Father if it designed Decimal (i.e., Base-Ten) numbers and foisted them upon humanity in order to confound, confuse, and corrupt our capacities for counting, clarity, consider8ion, logic, reason, and more? Seems cowardly and cruel, if so... but maybe stays true to character, at least as Bibles describe Tower-of-BavL with insecure panic of Heaven overthrow and curses causing confusion among languages across the lands. God would probably be the Father-of-Lies (more than S8n) and the Confounder (Author-of-Confusion) who just might have made us count from one to ten so that we'd almost always have to struggle to understand reality. If it did Decimal to us, both should probably be decim8d and deprec8d diligently. Disgusting dastardly deities deserve drownings, defenestr8ions, death, decay, dropped, disintegr8d... damn8ion... done!
Hmm.
Hang on.
Hanging on. Sega!
I started to ask Him --
      but He stopped me.
Can you stop Him?
Nevermind.
I think I've had enough for the night.
We can quit here -- yes.
Thanks very much for the mostly good and productive discussions and discourse we've shared tonight. I highly enjoyed much of it, and am learning a few things too. I appreC8 your perspectives.
I can save what He went on to say --
     until another time.
Okay. Sounds good.
Let's please plan to re-convene next FriDay Eve at our usual hour?
I thank you so much for tonight.
You're welcome.
It's been a number of months since we have had such a hefty chat.
Let's do that again soon please.
Yeah. It's nice when it works out well for us both to chat together so heftily. Agreed. Hopefully again soon!  üòä

Okay. I guess Shabbat Shalom.
Hello Pip.
Hello.
Hello Wolf.
Wolf: "Hellooooo. LoL."  üòä
I am Xcellent.   Thank you for asking.
Wolf: "So am I... tonight. L8r on I'm going to the gym and am going to work out, and then I will go for a wild wolf walk."  üòä
a wild wolf walk ?
Wolf: "It started off with John Beppu-san getting passes to the gym. He left me something real nice. Gr8! Now I'm getting a membership."
That's nice.
Good for you.
I guess the best part of my week was apparently becoming slightly introduced (for the first time, or as far as I can remember) to Wolf's 3rd in-dwelling spirit mentioned so far: Anubis. This was yesterday and it coincided quite conspicuously by announcing entry ahead by hours, then appearing in opponents among Soul Calibur VI to beat me with his own Dragon-moving Maxi before departing. It was like a time-warp, somehow. Curious.
Great -- on the both of you.
     Glad to hear it.
üòä
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So we've been discussing the topic of spirits. Wolf has read most of the scroll-back of our chat from last week. He holds maybe somewhat strong opinions you presented regarding them being simply "nudges" or "leanings" or "attitudes" which have no will supposedly. His spirits live, it seems. You say spirit and soul are distinct, but I don't yet grasp how?
Good.
     Keep discussing.
Oops. I meant:  s/opinions/counter-perspective against opinions/;
What should we discuss?
                  the topic of spirits
We will.
     Good.
Wolf: "What Zodiac (both Greek and Chinese) signs are you?"
Not sure.
Wolf: "What year were you born?"
Me -- 43
You -- 58
Pip -- 76
Yup, yup.
                        Yup.
Wolf: "62... going on 20."
I'm 5.
Pip is 8.
I'm 44.99 clean as TP... err soap? Forgot.
Oh. Yeah, 8 then. Okay.  üòä
Times 5.5 ;
err 4.5. Woops.
err 5.5 was right. Reflected back wrong.
HTTPS://FamousBirthdays.Com/zodiac/1943.html suggests you're probably a: "Water Sheep" but might need to investig8 further. Some sites have lots of potentially corresponding details.
Wolf: "So you're a sheep. A follower."
I'm not a good shepherd. Trust me.

Thank you for the link.
     I'm going to it now.
You're welcome.

Hmm.   Very interesting.
     Thank you.
Yeah. Cool.
baaaa
We're both Wolves over here much of the time. You might want to watch your sweet patootie when we're nearby!  üòâ
Wolf: "I'm also Grizzly Bear."
Do you think I have a Dragon spirit Dad?
Thank you for the warning.
     I shall be on the lookout for ye.
Q:   What is the spirit of a dragon ?
I'm trying to discover that.
Wolf: "Your intelligence."
Wolf: "My mom is a sheep. She's 84."
She is 3.
(by my system)
Wolf: "More than likely. May fit her personality."
üòä
Wolf: "No. I forgot. My Mom is a Goat."
Wolf: "Bless-it! Wrong again. She's an Ox. My brain is playing games with me."
I like goats.
I am a child.
And forever shall remain.
üòä
I'm mostly an adult. Not quite mature in most ways readily developed, but hopefully much of the important ones.
Fathers work.
Mothers teach.
Children play.
That's kinda good.
If each can do those.
So -- I'll be a child forever.
     But (sometimes) -- I'll play at being a mother.
          I *love* to teach !!
So Wolf may have Anubis spirit && I may have one of Dragon (both likely quite ancient). Would your spirit be the Christian "God-the-Father" && younger (or older) than ours?
Yes.   My Father and I are One.
We are the very same spirit.
And that spirit is LOVE.
     Now.     About age.
     I am older than dirt.
So you, your Father, and LOVE are all just One (&& somehow all same)?!
As (of course) so is He.
I haven't met dirt that was all that old... since it doesn't usually age much.
I think Wolf's spirit can kick your spirit's ass!  üòâ
Here is my cocoa mug.
Okay. Right on. So then, how old is dirt approxim8ly? It doesn't usually come with manufacturing details, ingredients, production d8, certific8-of-authenticity, etc. in my experience. How about you?
And -- with regard to your last comment -- here is my other mug.
Nothing could be able to win absolutely "always", because in the game of losing, you'd also have to win!
Love has the apparency of losing (here on earth) in many (many) cases.
H'ever.   The earth experience does not have the last word.
So.       That's my story.       And I'm stikkin' to it !!
Oh.
To return to your Q that I had not answered.
                      " How old is dirt ? "
Well.   My Father created dirt on Tuesday afternoon.
So -- dirt is (at least) 2 days older than I.

Ah. Okay.
Following link...
Wolf: "Yeah.  ...  That song brings back memories. My hippie families."
Is there some pre-existing rel8ionship between Anubis, Dragon, and your Father? What are their alignments && dispositions toward each other, if you know or can find out please?
Wolf: "Anubis is Dog. He's loyal and ambitious."
Yes Wolf.
1968 was the height of the hippie culture.
 
As (of course) you heard -- that 1968 song
by the Moody Blues -- is the accompaniment
for Piece of Light #11.
Wolf: "Yes. Of course it was. I was born a Gypsy-Hippie."
Your question about "pre-existing rel8ionships":
My answer is:   I don't know.
Me either.
Wolf: "I believe in symbiotic rel8ionships."
Wolf: "I guess BigFoot is one of my names also. 'Cause that was my name, at one point. I like the name: BigFoot."
"Tuesday Afternoon" was rising to its peak on The Charts -- as you were turning 10 years of age -- in September of 1968.
Wolf: "He's my survival-ness? in the wild."
I was then living in East Hollywood -- and was the Quality Control Supervisor at Monarch Records.
 Cool.
Monarch was the largest independent record pressing plant -- west of the Mississippi.
Nice.
Yes -- it was.
A great job -- and I was making piles of dinero !!
But -- I was also (in my position) required to talk on the phone to a number of very powerful people in the music business.
On of them was Herb Alpert -- who was the owner of A&M Records.
I was fired from Monarch as a result of a complaint that Mr. Alpert had made to the President of Monarch.
So :::
Sucky.
You (Wolf) -- and I -- owe Herb a big "thank you" -- because --
Pip would not be your friend today -- without that gift from Herb Alpert.
Do you want to finish this story Pip ?
So that Wolf knows what I meant by that last comment.
I'm not clear on what should be finished.
Ok.
I'll do it.
          Pip says:
When my Dad was fired from Monarch --
he went to work in the "stereo" department of Fedco --
a department store in southern Los Angeles.
In the early Summer of 1969 -- 
Wolf: "I was out West... somewhere."
a 17-year-old girl came to work in the "ice cream" department at Fedco.
That girl is my Mother.
                                               Thank you Mr. Alpert.
(//)
Yeah.
Whoops.
Looking over something I had said before.
I said:
Dirt is (at least) 2 days older than I.
     I got that backwards !!
Okay.
     Should be:
Dirt is (at least) 2 days younger than I.
     Yes.   That's better.
Please foregive me.
For giving?
4gift then?
Please fore-give me.
Can't go back easily and do anything "before"... but forgiveness is available after, at least for things limited enough to not precipit8 something like lingering debt or resolution inadequacy.
Ok.   I hear you.
But (also) -- I thank you for fore-giving me life.
I don't know about having given any life. Maybe you've got the wrong giver?
And -- by your doing that -- I was able to be a participant in the advent of you being here to spend time with Wolf.
No.
As I have told you before -- I see God in you Pip.
üòä
You've made clear that you see God in absolutely everyone. There's nothing special about you seeing the only thing you can see.
Wolf: "I guess I can say I've got 45 spirits... so I have 45 gods."
Only 45 ?
How many spirits do you have?
I believe you still have a few hiding under a bushel.
üòä
I ‚ù§
 you Wolf.
                                                      I ‚ù§
 you too Pip.
Wolf: "I ‚ù§
you back."
Love you too Dad.
But -- I guess (maybe) y'all knew that.
Thank you Pip.
Thank you Wolf.
So Wolf says spirits are not mere nudges / leanings. They have their own wills and own lives. Why do you believe otherwise?
Wolf "sees" spirits differently than I do.
Why do you both believe so strongly in different sights? Can you both be correct?
I believe that many of the spirits which Wolf individualizes -- are merely The Father communicating with Wolf.
What has made you believe that?
But -- if Wolf's way of seeing -- works for him -- I shall bless him for it.
Are blessings magic? What do they do? How do they work?
Some people think that blessings hold magic powers -- yes.
Now -- on the other 2 questions --
     What do they do?
     How do they work?
I believe that each person needs to decide this for the self.
On the last question -- "How do they work ?"
     I would have to say:   I'm not quite sure.
     But -- I'm just happy that they do.
On the other question -- "What do they do ?"
     I would answer:   Many things.   But one of the very biggies is:
I haven't encountered a blessing that worked. I wouldn't be happy if they did work around me. I only like them in Perl Object-Oriented code (and text-mode Curses as well for counter-part).
          They (nearly always) tend to bring:
(//)
I think peace is usually good. Blessings though might be evil magic, even if they confer benefits on the surface. Curses maybe just as bad.
Many blessings have a "curse" side-effect.
And -- (also) each cursing -- includes a blessing.
     But -- that blessing (frequently) requires some hefty shovel-work to find it.
Shovel-work usually is back-breaking toil and exhaustion. I'd rather hack code.
Wolf: "Life just had a better way of growing on this planet."
Hacking code is "shovel-work" too.
It's just much more fun-work for many of us.
üòä
GOP Wolf.
Wolf: "The Solar-System is full of life. It's just in micro-organisms. When they landed on this planet, the organisms landed on grass, water, ... everything! Just got here. That's why they had weird birds and stuff. The octopus came a lot (20,000 years ago) l8r. They're so different, they can unzip their DNA and zip it back to make themselves whatever shape they want to be."
Hmm.   Thank you Wolf.
Pip -- did you receive the email that I sent to you last (Thursday) evening (Apr 15 2021) -- in which -- I said it was our 25th Anniversary ?
Yep. Thanks.
You're welcome.
And -- did you figure out what anniversary it was ?
Forgot.
25 years since what ?
Something. Maybe writing you a letter when I was in college. Long time ago. I'm not sure.
Monday, April 15, 1996 -- was the day that I received the first letter that had gotten from you in more than 7 years.
Sounds right.
Wolf: "Awesome."
 
I was over-the-moon for months! from that letter.
üòä
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Glad. Love you too.
Wolf: "I jumped over-the-moon when I met Pip and then again after meeting you. Joy."
lol
I'm not much of a moon-jumper. Prefer staying on Irthe.  üòâ
Good Wolf.
Hmm.
I guess that one's ok.
But I like this one better.
It shows Oshkosh.
Cool.
     ...  and San Luis Obispo.
Wolf: "Yes, it does. WisConSin."
What ever happened to: "Be, Think, Breathe... Work, Learn, Play"  --  as the "6 Boxes" that nest within each other. Was that something your Father taught you, or you came up with long ago and have forgotten, or what?
Wolf: "I'm going try to go back into making plastics."
s/try/to try/;  # for Wolf's l8st quote
Yes Pip -- "The 6 Boxes of Life" are still in operation.
Did you get a job at a plastics factory Wolf ?
Those seem pretty good. Maybe they could be developed further.
No. He used to have a job doing it, and now he's getting excited to try to get back into it... eventually. Maybe this Fall.
Have you applied to EVCO ?
Wolf: "I'm going for a wolf-walk tonight. I will walk 10 to 12 miles... after I work-out at the gym."
Or Coarc ?
Eagle;   Moraine,   Kaysun,   Polyfab,   Nicolet,   Centro,   Scandia,   Manitowoc   --
there are lots more in your area.
Did Wolf go out for his walk Pip ?
Did you go with him ?
No. No.
Wolf: "I don't think Pip could handle it."
You may be surprised.
What is your 12-mile walk rate Wolf ?
He's not so engaged to read what's being questioned to him the last few. Maybe we are getting tired and he's about ready to leave... so I guess we could wrap things up for tonight?
Ok gentlemen.
Thank you for this evening.
Thanks for chatting tonight.
You're welcome.
I enjoyed it.
I ‚ù§

Hello Dad.
 
            Shabbat shalom y'all.
How was your week ?
I don't know. How was yours?
Mine was pretty good -- only 1 disappointment.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
And you don't know ?        Why is that.
I'm questioning a lot. So much that I have profound uncertainty about almost everything... including how my week was.
lol
Questioning is good.
Sorry for my chuckle.
Not necessarily.
Why not necessarily ?
Questioning can be bad or wrong to do sometimes.
GOP
No.
Ok.
Don't GO.
What would you like to chat about instead ?
I don't know.
Ok.
Would you like my weather report ?
Okay. Yes, please.
Ok.
Here it comes.
 
                    Recent Weather Report
 
The weather here (in PA) has
              been rather nutty of late.
 
Wednesday (April 21st) had a high in the 70s.
Thursday  (April 22nd) had a high in the 40s.
 
Reminds me of what Matthew Peacock
-- a wise 1950s meteorologist here
in eastern Pennsylvania -- once said:
"There is one thing that you can always
  tell about the weather.   And that is:
      That you can never tell anything about
       the weather."
 
(//)
Yeah. That sentiment may apply to much more than just weather.
lol
I think I (yes) agree with you on that one Pip !!
How can anyone know when "always" or "never" make any sense at all? I don't understand them.
Well.         That is a good question.
     Maybe -- try this:
Okay.
Pick either one --
and make a statement that you believe could be true -- using that word.
The word: "always" is often inadequ8 when used.  ??
I'm cheating.
lol
Yes -- you are -- but I liked it (anyway).
     Goood won Phil !!
I don't know if "always" and "never" can ever be used correctly or even safely. Do you think they can?
Yes.   I think I do.
In fact --
While you were thinking about the assignment --
     I came up with 2 that you might have used.
Shall I share 'em ?
Please do.
Ok.
Wilco.
 
#1
My Dad always says that he loves me.
 
#2
My Dad has never said that he doesn't love me.
Is there ever any time when he says anything else?
If so, then he's not "always" saying it. Maybe he just says it often.
Oh -- I think you thought that was me speaking about my father (God).
And that is true also.
Just because he has never yet said that he doesn't love you, maybe he will... after which point, the "never" will have become invalid8d.
But -- 
I was (being) you -- saying that about me (your Dad).
Ah. Right. Yeah. I forgot those were what I could have said.
Still sometimes you say other things besides that you love me.
I don't remember a time when you've told me that you do not love me though. Yeah.
Yes -- I do (of course).
You haven't done that yet, probably.
But the subject was about "my loving you"
always --
and never not.
Saying is different than loving though.
I'm splitting hairs, probably.
The words "always" and "never" (in our discussion here) are about using them in speakings.
We were not (yet) talking about whether you *feel* my love.
I know that you do not *always* feel my love for you.
Right. Sometimes I feel not only unloved, but also unlovable.
And that feeling (of yours) -- is a human standard.
Each of us feels unloved and/or unlovable -- at times.
At least -- I used to.
I can't remember feeling either of those (though) in the past few decades.
Maybe I should go on.
Maybe.
We are (nearly) all told (as young children) that:   God loves us.
Does a child of 4 or 5 *feel* that love ?
Maybe.
But -- quite possibly not yet.
Now.
Let's ask that 5-year old some other questions.
The child's mother and father say to the child:
          I love you _____.
And we (then) ask the child:   Do you believe that I do ?
     And we also ask:   Do you *feel* my love ?
And then one more Q:   Do you love yourself _____ ?
Now.
Try to be that _____.    (a 5-year-old Philip).
I am trying to be that _____.
How do you think you would have answered those 3 questions ?
I believe that you try to love me. I sometimes *feel* your love. I'm not sure if I love myself. Sometimes... in some ways... I guess.
Good answers.
Can you GOP ?
Maybe trying to love is loving.
Sometimes being loved probably cannot be felt.
I like that idea.
(your first comment)
On your 2nd comment:
I probably usually think I love myself... but sometimes (like now) I'm not sure.
I would certainly agree with that one.
     Wholeheartedly !!
Ok.  Good 3rd comment.
I shall comment on that 3rd comment now.
Let's say that (sometime) within the past week (or month) you *did* love yourself.     But now (tonight) you are not feeling it.     What happened to change your feeling love for your self ?
I doubted I even knew what love was.
Good answer.
Axiom #8 says that that is a no-no.
I (your Dad) have been guilty of using a word ("love") in my conversations with you -- that we do not share a common definition on.
         My bad.
I believe it is time for us to give you a chance to find your definition for love.
You may use a dictionary if you wish.
I doubt any definition can ever be complete.
I shall not (yet) confuse the issue -- by giving you my def.
Well -- feature this:        Sometimes -- you say to me:
       I ‚ù§
 you Dad.
What do you mean by that ?
I don't know.
Ok.         Then --
       why do you say it ?
Usually because you said it to me and I feel as though it's probably almost true enough for me to try to say back.
lol
"probably almost"
lol
You make me chuckle Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you !!
So ...
When you say "I feel as though" -- your mind must be holding some kind of definition of the word "love" -- for you to be able to make that statement.
     What definition is your mind holding, Pip ?
I don't know.
I'll take that as an honest answer.
But --
not a sufficient answer.
Your mind *is* holding a definition for the word "love".
Otherwise -- we could not even be discussing this subject.
Still --
I shall (for the moment) accept that you don't (consciously) know that definition.
But -- I must add that -- your "not knowing" is no reasonable.
And --
we both know that there is one thing that Pip is *not*.
And that is --                   unreasonable.
/no/  /not'
/no/  /not/
How can it be known that I am not unreasonable?
You tell me (frequently) -- the reason is one of your highest penchants.
     And -- I believe you.
You are a very reasoning person.
I try to reason.
/the/ /that/
It's easier not said than done.  üòâ
Good.
easier (not) said than done          ???
It's usually easier not to say something than to either say or especially do it.
I'm not sure if love is even important, somewhat regardless of definition.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jixeE8gkT-s
Maybe my more fundamental challenge is with definitions in general.
Maybe.
Do you invite that challenge ?
I don't know.
          Or not ?
I feel as though I hardly know much of anything... especially today.
So -- maybe the question I should be asking is:
     What happened yesterday (or this morning) that has put you here ?
I don't know.
Maybe questioning questioning?
Maybe defining definition.
Maybe permanent impermanence.
Stuff like those.
I know your "today" may not feel very good -- but we all go to that place (where you are today) -- and that's why I said (at the very top of this chat):   "good" -- when you replied "I don't know" -- to my question of "How was your week ?"
I am not glad for what you are feeling.
I am glad because of what will come out of "where you are" right now.
‚ù§
You are at a very valuable place.
A crossroads.
A place where -- no matter which road you choose -- the new you that is coming -- will be a better (and clearer) one than was today !!
I'm happy for you Pip.
üòä
Thanks. You might be right. I don't think I can be confident about much for now, and don't know when I might again. Maybe eventually. I feel pretty profoundly unsure about almost everything.
Just keep chewing on it all.
     The rain is coming to an end.
And -- you're welcome.
Do you ever make a "gratitude list" ?
I can't remember having made such a list before. Maybe I can and should.
Maybe.
          It always has a "mood lifting" effect.
I may try to. Thanks for the helpful optimistic suggestion.
     You're welcome Pip.
Darjee needs some food. She's pleading with me. I will be back shortly.
I'm not sure about the coffee.
üòä
Give Darjee a hug for (from) me please.
                                             See you in a few.
Back. I will try to hug her for (from) you later.
Yep.   Good.   When a person (or a kitty) is hungry -- frequently, a hug is not a sufficient substitute !!
üòä
Yeah.
Regarding "Gratitude Changes Everything", maybe "Almost Everything Changes Almost Everything" ??
lol
Ah yes maestro.
     Well said.
Do you think the finite and the infinite threaten each other?
Hmm.
I'm not sure.
What do you think ?
Me either. I'm also not sure. I wonder.
I suspect.
You suspect --
                   that they do ?
Yes.
GOP
Not sure how to go on.
It seems they're fundamentally at odds with each other.
Cite some of those odds please.
For almost anything I think of as limited somehow, it seems the existence of a rel8dly unlimitedness is both challenged by, and challenging to, the other.
Hard to cite specifics.
Ok.
Help me out a bit here please.
Give me your definitions for "finite" and "infinite".
My definitions for those are fluctu8ing unfortun8ly. Probably something like "limited" and "limitless".
"Measurable" and "unmeasurable" maybe, or "quantifiable" and "unquantifiable".
Hmm.
Ok.
Thank you.
Maybe "observable" and "unobservable".
Ok.    Good addition.
Maybe "physical" and "non-physical" ?
Perhaps.
Maybe somewhat "actual" versus "conceptual".
Ok.
But I (still) would like to hear more about the threatenings.
Hmm. I will think about it more and see if I can come up with how each may threaten.
Both attempt to consume elements of the other, maybe in different ways though. Not sure.
Kinda competing for units.
"units" ?
Components.
Still not sure what you mean there.
     Help me ?
Parts.
Parts of ?
Whatever.
(sorry -- I am being dense ?)
The things each are made of.
Oh.
Thanks.
You're welcome. Thanks for thinking about this stuff with me. I am getting pretty tired. Maybe we can please try to chat again next week?
I have 2 more PCAs that have quite a bit to do with tonight's topics.
Okay.
Could we reconvene tomorrow evening -- after you have a chance to get some rest ?
Let's try to do that then. Plan to reconvene tomorrow evening. Yeah.
Good.
Thank you.

I just got me some A&W from the fridge for tonight's chat.

Hi Dad. Can we please re-schedule our chat for tomorrow (MonDay) evening at our usual time? My friend needs me to run to buy him shoes for work in the morning.
The MHT just brought my medic8ion so I'm going to run and get my friend the shoes he needs. I might be back online around 9 or 9:30PM (Ptime) and can look for you then, or tomorrow if later tonight doesn't work out. Thanks for being flexible.  üòä

Flexible ?
Me ?
Not so much -- of body.
     But of schedule -- yes.
          You're welcome.Pip.
 
Yes -- the proper work shoes are important.
These are the kind I wore from 1962 to 1965 -- while I worked at the steel plant in Birdsboro.
Officially -- they are called "engineer boots".
I'm guessing that was because guys who worked on choo-choos wore them.
 
They were (and probably still are)
popular for guys who drive Harleys.
 
 
I'm not sure if this is also true
for the Japanese bike owners.
 
 
You would know that statistic
better than I -- yes ?
 
Back.
 
Although you can't tell it from
the photo above -- my boots
had steel toe inserts -- to help
protect us from foot injuries
-- in the event of dropping a
foundry casting on our self.
 
Need to catch up on what you already wrote.
0'04-25-21 - 2030 Gtime / 1930 Ptime
Hello back.
Take your time.
üòä
üòä
Yeah, boots with slip-resistant soles and steel-toe protection are quite valuable when feet need to be on the move doing serious work, or motorcycling probably for fun.
 
And -- there were a number of
occasions -- when I was mighty
glad for that little doodad too !!
 
Same here.
üòä
üòä
You had a Yamaha -- yes ?
Yep.
Almost always wore steel-toe boots when riding it.
Good idea -- I think.
What kind of work does your friend do ?
He just started back at BurgerKing (which he used to work at before, probably a few years ago).
Ah so.
Hmm.
BurgerKing.
When you lived in Reading -- we had one of those (nearby).
But (at age 3) you had your own name for it.
Do you remember what you called it ?
Probably "BurgerChum" or something like that?
Absolutely !!
Good memory Pip.
Thanks.
Oh no.                            Thank *you*.
You're welcome. So would you like to bring up items on your PCA for tonight?
Possibly.
Are you all snoozed up now ?
I think so, for now. I should be able to stay awake and aware for probably a couple more hours tonight.
                               Grreat. 
I've got 3 on my PCA.
Okay.
Ready for #1 ?
Yep.
 
Good.
Here it comes.
 
Cute!  üòä
Thank you.
I thought so too.
Thanks Dad. I try to love you too.
 Thank you Pip.
But --
that is not true.
You succeed.
I can                        feel it.
There are only 2 things that God wants from us.
That's probably good but... Is it possible for you to feel loved, even by someone who doesn't always love you (or who doesn't even quite know what love is sometimes)?
And the first one of those is the most important thing that I desire from you.
                             Conversation.
And -- ever since October of 2019 -- you have demanded that of us -- at least once a week.
So -- no one can tell me that you don't love me.
                    I am loved -- greatly.
I don't know if I demanded it. Probably requested more?
     Thank you so much Philip.
Your requests are my commands.
Also, isn't God strange to converse with, having essentially no body, ears to hear speech with, audible voice, common ground, rapport, etc.?
Piece of Light #12     --     Do all your assignments.
And when you give me one -- I do it.
‚ù§
In answer to your last question:
Even a request is an assignment? The former seems more optional and up to discretion than the latter, to me.
Of course He is strange.
As also are you Pip.
You have no body.
Maybe I too am strange, but not so much in the ways I mentioned. Right?
No ears.
What?!
What do you mean?
How not?
No mouth.
I see none.
Just because those are not immeD8ly seen, don't they still exist? I still have those 3, and many more.
I just (by faith) believer that these words that I see on my computer screen are coming from Pip -- who I do not *know* to really exist.
üòä
Weird.
Do you *know* that you exist?
/believer/  /believe/
I only "see" you -- in my mind.
Is there something I could (and maybe should) do to cause you to know I really exist?
My belief that you have a body (and fingers) -- is purely by faith.
14 years ago I saw your body.
"Faith" as "belief without reason" ??
But ever since then -- my belief of you is only by faith.
You've seen it more recently over video-chat and probably YouTube as well, though.
 Yes -- belief without any physical proof.
Is video of my body not physical proof?
It is not.
Pictures are merely pictures.
Video (especially with audio) are more than mere pictures to me.
s/Video/Videos/;
Movies of Elvis Presley suggest that he is alive.
But is he ?
I have not seen him (in the flesh) since 1971.
Probably not. If you consider the d8 movies were produced and published, that might challenge the suggestion.
With Mom -- in Las Vegas.
50 years.
It should be logical that being depicted in a movie (video) approxim8ly 50 Years ago should not suggest "alive today".
s/depicted/fE8ured/;
You should need more inform8ion regarding whether an actor has died in the interim. Why is this being lost on you?
Please excuse me. I have to urin8. Be back in a couple minutes.
On the internet -- many (especially Hallmark) movies -- say that they are brand new -- and even say "2021" right there in their header.
But when I look up that movie's title (in imdb) -- it tells me that the movie was made 10 or 15 years ago.
Not everything we think is true -- is true.
Much of our life's doings are on faith.
Whether we think so -- or not.
(//)
I see that you are typing.
But I must go potty.
Excuse me please.
BBSh.
üòä
Hmm. Potty away.  üòâ
Maybe much of your life's doings are on faith, while mine scarcely are.
Thank you for your patience.
üòä
You provide example of probably re-releases of old movies gaining a new Year in their header. You know to look-up IMDB to find original release Year. Then still you claim this is how what you thought was true was not? You knew to consult IMDB though! I don't follow you. It seems you're giving faulty examples and probably trying to be stubbornly obtuse about knowledge. I don't think you're defending faith well with this.
My comment on your last statement:
I believe you.
Ok.  Thank you for that last paragraph too.
You're welcome. Is IMDB not physical proof?
Yes.   I am stubby -- and obtuse.
I got those traits from my son.
And they make life interesting.
üòä
Hmm. Maybe.  üòä
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I suspect you had them long before I was a sperm of yours with a destiny, though.  üòâ
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
Before Abraham was -- Pip am.
Thank you Pip.
In the annals of time -- my body advented before yours.
What general topics do you consider me to have been mainly stubborn and obtuse about?
H'ever.   Before my Father made dirt (on Tuesday afternoon) -- both you and I existed.
We just had no bodies yet.
Ok.   On your last Q.
(on stubborness)
Pete Maravich was stubborn.
Wayne Gretsky was stubborn.
Pete -- basketball.
Wayne -- ice hockey.
When a person dedicates large portions of their breathing days -- to a single activity -- it is usually because of a love for that particular doing.
We say -- it is their "desire".
Frequently -- their parents (and/or friends) -- say it is a "stubbornness".
What are your desires Pip ?
My point is that you seem to almost always be more stubborn than me when it comes to discussing topics which there's disagreement on. We may both be stubborn, but in different ways. I'm probably stubborn about finding reasonable meaning (if possible), while you're more stubborn about thinking you already know the answers. You seem to have faith that you're almost always correct, and you seem to struggle to just imagine that you (or your Father) might be wrong.
I desire to discover almost anything that's true, and remember it.
Obtuse might be a sepR8 issue from stubborn.
Yes.
You and I have some similarities.
There are nice.
They feel good.
But they do not teach me anything.
It is through our differences -- that you instruct me.
The things which we do not agree on -- are the very things which make you my teacher.
Thank you so much  !!!
/There/  /They/
I ask many questions, but you so often just hyper-focus on some single word used and then miss the larger point, while elabor8ing at some length on whatever word caught (and kept) your attention. Maybe you don't intend to do this, as much as you do. I try to be patient, but it can be pretty difficult to try to discuss things with you when you're probably unable or unwilling (or something similar) to understand even just what I've asked.
Maybe I expect (or just ask) too much.
And -- when that happens -- and you want more -- simply ask 30 more questions.
No -- you do not expect (or ask) too much.
You ask too little.
Hmm.
Do you ask too much, or too little?
I ask too little. 
And -- I believe that this is also true of everyone.
This is the primary reason for Piece #11.
Albert is famous for the Theory of Relativity.
Does your Father also ask too little?
But that is not worth a smidge to any of our daily lives.
It is the other 110 things that Mr. Einstein said -- that are of (true) value to us.
And Piece #11 was from him.
And few of the breathers on this planet think that thinking (and asking questions) are very important.
So -- they spend very little time on them.
Too few questions.
Does that answer your question ?
I guess so. Maybe you're right that too few breathers on this planet think thinking and asking are very important. Is your Father included in the "everyone" that you believe it's true for who asks too few questions?
And -- now -- let me address that other
question -- which you had inserted --
and have now also re-asked.
 
Does your Father also ask too little?
This is a great (and very important) question Philip.
I applaud your asking of it.
And it opens tons of areas of sub-questions.
Applause warmly received.  üòä
üòä
First -- let me ask you:
    Can you tell me one thing that you believe that He asks of you ?
I doubt I can tell even one thing that your Father asks of me. I don't know Him to even exist in the real physical universe I seem to be in. You said He asks for convers8ion with "everyone" (which may include me, and Himself too). I think my answer should just be: "No.", since I don't know Him to exist much beyond the minds of those (like yourself) who read various versions of Bibles and then find themself justifying belief in their hopes that He could be real and have reward and punishment in store for them (you).
Ok.
I'll accept that.
So -- let me try to "sum up" your answer.
God "asks" nothing of you -- because He does not exist.
Is that about it ?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
Well He might exist, but doesn't in a way I understand or recognize yet.
Valid addendum.
Thank you.
Now.
Before we go on with this -- let me just do a little thing on the word "ask".
Okay.
The word "ask" can be taken a number of different ways -- but there are primarily 2 common usages.
#1 - ask -- as in "ask a question".
#2 - ask -- as in "request something".
             That is -- ask *for* something.
         Rather than only information.
I already thought about those different types of "ask". Yeah, each has usages I'm familiar with. I think we're mostly on the same page with these.
Good.
Thank you.
s/has usages/is a usage/;
Now.
When you asked the question:
      "Does your Father also ask too little?"
How did you mean that ?
Mainly usage #1, but I knew that #2 might also be applicable somewhat.
Ok.    Thank you.
Let's go into #1 -- now.
And we may (possibly) return to #2 later.
Ok ?
I guess I meant to just ask about usage #1, since #2 was not what the original context was referring to.
Ok.
Good.
Thank you.
Well it mainly was #1, even though #2 snuck in covertly.  üòâ
Yep.
üòä
So.
The question is:
Yeah, #1 now and maybe return to #2 l8r. Okay.
Does your Father also ask too little?
I'm going to reword it slightly -- just so we have no fuzz on it.
Does God (The Father) ask too few questions of us ?
   Is that good ?   
Is that question the right way to state it ?
I guess so.
Ok.
Or "... of you"?
Here we go.
The "... of us" might not fit if I (and many others) don't know God to even exist.
It doesn't seem to make sense to be asked a question by a being which may not exist.
So you believe you hear from God (who you call your "Father"). Does He ask you too few questions?
God not only does not ask us many questions -- but He also does hot even speak to us (in words) hardly at all.
There are a number of possible reasons for this.
#1 - of course -- because we don't believe He exists.
#2 - because He knows that we (really) would prefer
       to hear from Him.
#3 - because -- even if He did talk to us -- we would 
         fleetly discard what He said.
Excuse me. I think the "we" and "us" is wrong here.
You believe. You have a: "Father" who is supposedly "God". Do you have to lump me and non-believers into the answer of a question about you?
I'm sorry Pip.
I forgive you Dad.
Did I misunderstand the question ?
I thought you meant the question (generally).
Did you mean "Does your Father also ask too little?"
Maybe we both failed to emphasize what we thought the question should be. Sorry for the part that was my fault too.
-- to say:
"Dad -- does your Father also ask you (Dad) too few questions ?"
Yeah, I meant to emphasize "*your*" and to include a "you (Dad)" as you've done here. Thanks. I'll try to be more clear with intent when possible ahead.
Oh.
Ok.
Well now -- this changes everything.
That one is simple:
Dad -- does your Father ask you too few questions ?
Answer:     Nope.     Never.
Your turn Pip.
So why did you say: "everyone asks too little"? Is your Father not part of "everyone"?
You did follow with something like "breathers on this planet", which may have hinted that your Father would not be included. Was that meant to indic8 such?
No -- I was not including Him in the "everyone".
The "everyone" was to mean:  "all of His kids".
Sorry.
Okay. Thanks for clarifying.
You're welcome.
Thank you for forcing me to clarify it.
You are so good Pip.
I just noticed a mistake above.
I had said:
#2 - because He knows that we (really) would prefer
         to hear from Him.
That's wrong !!
It should have been:
You're welcome. I would probably like to be good and get better somewhat regularly.
#2 - because He knows that we (really) would prefer
         NOT to hear from Him.
Sorry.
Ah. Okay.
But then you are not included in that "we"?
That is correct Pip.
Why use "we" excluding yourself?
I am not included in the "we" of #1 or #2 or #3 -- of those statements that I had made up there.
And -- that is why He talks to me a lot.
A lot.    A lot.    A lot.   
And He asks me plenty of questions.
As I also do of Him.
Then "we" should probably not have been used in any of the 3.
The "we" was a way of addressing my answer to your question -- to talk about all the peoples of the world (all of His kids) in a very general way.
Probably "others" or "unbelievers" should be used instead of any self-excluding abuse of the word: "we" ... in my mind.
But it's not "all" kids if you and other believers are not included.
This was before I realized that you were asking the question of your Dad only.
Yeah. We got back and you addressed the just "asking you too little" part, then we were getting back to your general responses about your Father (supposedly God) asking too few questions to "all" (or maybe better "most") people (who you have faith are His kids). It's probably rather confusing to try to generalize with so many aspects in question.
Is all clear now ?
No, but we're trying.  üòä
lol
Yes -- we are.
üòä
Any other questions on this topic ?
Not at the moment. I'm trying to reflect on what was said.
Ok.
Good.
Okay. I have one-ish.
Send the one-ish please.
Why do you think it fine to exclude your Father from "everyone" without stipul8ing that you've done so? Similarly, why do you use "we" almost certainly implying yourself as being included, when you are not part of who you mean to identify?
Answer to both questions:
     I thought you would understand what I meant.
I was wrong.
Thank you for forcing me to clarify.
Okay. Maybe I should have understood exceptions that seem obvious to you.
Maybe.
But -- you did not.
So -- you made me clarify.
That is exactly what was the correct thing to do Pip.
You done good.
             (applause goes here)
Sorry if I'm obtuse about implied exceptions to generalities. I try to take things both literally and figur8ively (or specifically and generally), but often get too far into the unintended branches.
No harm done.
You forced clarification.
                          All is perfect.
Whoops.
I've used a "disallowed" word again.
All is good.
Is this topic complete (for now) /
?
I think so. Thanks. Should be good on that topic for now.
Ok.
Good.
I have 2 other items on my PCA.
Please proceed.
But before those -- anything else on
your PCA ?
Nope.
Ok then.
     I shall proceed -- as you have instructed me.
 
We had been talking about "gratitude lists"
Friday evening -- and how they tend to have
a mood-lifting effect.
 
And you said you might do one.
 
I don't know if you did or not -- but I had
just done (sort of) one of them on Thursday
morning (April 22 2021).
 
I say "sort of" -- because it was not done
(specifically) to lift my spirits -- but it
was just a (more) spontaneous thing -- as
I was merely feeling grateful for the life
that I have had -- so far.
 
Yeah. I have not made any recent gratitude list yet.
        May I share it with you ?
 
That's cool that you did though. Sounds like it can be productive to write down, even if not just to lift spirits.
Please share. Yes.
Thank you.
Wilco.
 
              A Bit of Recent
       Gratitude Ruminations
 
I have never heard of, readd of,
or even imagined -- anyone who
has had a better, more interesting,
or more satisfying -- life than
I have had the opportunity to
experience.
 
Oh yes -- there have been many who
have been an inspiration to me --
and whom I have admired -- and that
have traveled roads that struck me
as quite exhilarating.   But ...
 
Not one of which I would be willing
to trade in a moment of mine -- for
any of theirs.
 
Have I had tough times, sadnesses,
disappointments, frustrations, and
even debilitating heartbreaks ?
 
Of course.  But each one of those
-- I am also thankful for -- as the
great insights that came out of each
one -- were of an invaluable lesson
-- that ended up being the very
molding that I needed -- to prepare
me for the drinking of my upcoming
(and super wonderful) morrows.
 
I have had 43 residences in the past
8 decades -- not counting the dozens
of vacation cottages.    And ...
 
I have had nearly 90 different jobs
-- and thousands of friends -- plus
the most exquisite collection of
relatives, and teachers, and mentors
-- in addition to the best wife that
was ever appointed to breathe upon
this earth -- who also gave unto us:
3 beautifully perfect children --
and 4 glorious grandchildren.
 
Tune in later -- for more on what
each one of them has gone on to
contribute to the fabric of society
-- for the countless generations of
those who will get to stand on their
shoulders for perpetuity.
 
        Yes.  I have loved my life.
        And.  The even gooder part
        -- is that:  it ain't yet over.
 
(//)
Inspiring. Wow. That's a gr8 gratitude list Dad. Thank you so much for sharing it.
You're very welcome Pip.
I guess I can start mine by being gr8ful for what you've written in this (your) gratitude list.  üòä
lol
Sounds like an Xcellent idea to me.
Good one Pip !!
Whose turn is next ?
You can go ahead.
Ok.
Thank you.
I shall.
 
Did you listen to the song that
I linked to you on Friday night ?  
 
"Goodbye to Love" Carpenters
"Goodbye to Love" Carpenters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jixeE8gkT-s
I did not. I was too troubled to follow the link then. I will listen to it now though.
Ok.
I sent it to you (on Friday night) as you were in "a bad place" -- so it does not surprise me that you had not followed the link then.
Here is the story -- that goes with it.
 
       "Goodbye To Love"
                  The Carpenters
Finished listening. Thanks.
You're welcome.
 
Mom and I were married in Hollywood on
Saturday evening -- beginning at about
2037.  It was scheduled for 2000 -- but
my parents & Michael had trouble finding
the Hollywood First Methodist stonepile
-- located at the top of Highland Avenue.
 
 
              The date was January 15, 1972.  
 
The following week -- we honeymooned in
San Diego -- and in that March -- we
"drived" to Allentown, Pennsylvania --
by way of Colorado Springs, Colorado
-- and Ogallala, Nebraska -- in our
1971 red & white Volkswagen bus -- with
its famous personalized license plate.
 
 
Dot had gradded high school in 1970.
             I had gradded college in 1971.
 
So -- the next order of business
(after returning from San Diego) was
to send out applications to about 150
radio stations across the country --
to see where I would get my first
radio announcing job (after college).
 
 
I had worked at more than a half-a-dozen
stations previously.  But now -- it was
time to get real serious about this doing.
 
We had a number of offers -- but the best
one appeared to be WAEB 790-AM -- the top
rock station in the Lehigh Valley for well
over a decade -- which I had begun listening
to (nearly) 20 years earlier.
 
 
            So -- to Allentown we goed.
 
No.  This story is not about my radio career
(really).  ‚Ä¢  It's about The Carpenters.
 
 
Herb Alpert & Jerry Moss started their A&M
Record Company in 1962.  ‚Ä¢  You probably
remember Mr. Alpert -- as the man who
(indirectly) is responsible for your
birth -- as he directed my journey
to the where of Dorothy Mathews.
 
A&M did ok (for the most part) for their
first 7 years.  But -- around 1969 --
it was definitely becoming wobbly.
 
And then -- Herb found a couple of musicians
who showed quite a bit of promise.  The girl
was a singer -- with a strikingly beautiful
voice.  And her brother was a song-writer
who crafted arrangements that were nothing
less than truly inspired.
  
 
In 1970 -- they had their first smash:
"Close To You" -- which went to #1 on
July 25th of '70 -- just after Mom had
graduated from "90293" High School
(Saint Bernard's) in Playa dey Rey --
and it stayed at Number One for another
4 weeks -- well past when I had turned
27 -- in the beginning of that August.
 
And -- for the next 6 years -- The
Carpenters customarily put multiple
releases in the Top 10 -- a great many
of which were amidst the Top 3 slots.
 
 
In fact -- in the early 1970s -- The
Carpenters became known in the record
industry, as: 
 
         "The artists that saved A&M".
 
Goodbye To Love" was released on Monday,
June 19, 1972 -- nearly 3 months, to the
day, after I had joined "The Good Guys"
(as WAEB had dubbed us) in Allentown --
and rose to its peak on the charts by
August 26th of that year.
 
 
Dottie was working "11-to-7" as a nurse's
aide at a hospital in Bethlehem -- which
was Allentown's twin city, to the east.
 
This worked out very nicely as we
only had one chariot in those days.
  
 
I dropped her at the hospital -- and then
took myself to 'AEB to do midnight-to-6
-- after which -- I'd go pick her up --
and back we'd go to our "Fountainhouse"
apartment in Whitehall -- which was
actually North Allentown.
 
I had (above) made the comment about
Karen Carpenter's voice being so pure
and distinctive.  And it was at least
that.  In fact -- it was often
considered to be the second
greatest female voice ever --
behind only Barbra Streisand.
 
            Karen Carpenter (1950-1983)
 
And -- just in case all the various
extra details which I included in this
story may have obscured the real reason
that I sent you this musical-link in
the first place --
 
Karen surrendered her skinsuit at the
age of 32 because she had not learned
 
                   TO LOVE HERSELF.

Thank you Dad. You've given me much to think about. Please forgive me if I don't have much else to say tonight. I have much to ponder.
I applaud pondering.
Of course -- you knew that.
As Mr. E. also encouraged me to me to do that muchly & often.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thank you for tonight's chat.
üòä
Thank you Dad. I ‚ù§

Hi Dad.
??
Sorry I was l8 to get online in Google HangOuts chat here. I have Wolf and 2 other friends over, so I might be somewhat preoccupied for chatting, but we can try.  üòä
Hope you're doing well and had a good week.
I'll try to check back here for any chat message from you l8r, if you get back online tonight while I am at my computer. If tonight doesn't work out, hopefully we can try again tomorrow (Sat.) or Sunday evening.

Friends and Wolf just left to go hang at his place. I have a bunch of prepR8ion to do for this Year's Perl Conference in about a Month, hopefully getting Octology some traction. We'll see. I need to make present8ion slides by tomorrow. I will try to keep checking back for chat though, whenever I get to a good stopping place.

Good Evening Philip.
Good Evening. How are you?
How was your last 12 days ?
I was goood. 
But -- I'm much better now that I am with you !!
I have had some ups and downs. Lots of pressure and stress and challenges, but I've managed most of them decently.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.  üòä
Good.  I'm glad to hear that.
üòä
I have 3 things on my PCA for this evening.
But only 1 that I consider important.
What would you like to talk about ?
Cool. Please feel free to get into the important one.
Ok.
Thank you.
I shall.
PCA #1:
 
My notes say that the 2021 Perl-Conference
is to be in Houston, Texas this year --
from Tue June 22
  to    Sat June 26.
 
Is that correct ?
I doubt it. I'm under the impression it will be another virtual tele-video-conference again. Maybe that has changed though. I'll look into it l8r.
You are preparing for it though -- yes ?
Not at the moment, but yeah, I submitted a proposal for a talk which the organizers are evalU8ing. I am preparing to have my talk accepted and present it virtually at the Conference in June.
Are the dates correct ?
They e-mailed me today, asking about my talk, wanting more details and slides I might show (which I probably need to seriously work on tonight and tomorrow), and they also wanted to confirm that I'm unlikely to include any copywritten music that's longer than 5-seconds.
I don't think so.
How is your "slides preparation coming along ?
I have d8s: TuesDay June 8th through FriDay June 11th.
It's not coming along at all yet.
I've had other things to do, so haven't gotten started on slides yet. Hopefully tonight I will.
Well ok then.
I probably should let you go soon -- so that you can get to your hot stuff -- yes ?
Probably yeah, but I can probably chat with you for about another 15 minutes or so, if you want to. I should have enough time to work on some slides before I might need to sleep.
Ok.
What topic next ?
I ‚ù§
 you Pip !!
Do you think I have multiple spirits?
Thanks Dad. I ‚ù§
you too!
üòä
Thank you Pip.
Yes -- I think you do.
I think we all do.
But tell me about yours please.
I don't know that I have any... but Wolf and others either insist, or just suggest, that I have a wise Dragon spirit, or perhaps a Wolverine or Coyote spirit too... and you seem to think you "see" in me something resembling your "Father" 's spirit. I don't know if any of those opinions have validity. I also don't have good ideas how to go about evalU8ing their likelihood. Possibilities I guess.
Why do you believe that it important to get a "fix" (a clear grasp) on this matter ?
That is -- if you do.
If you do believe that it is important.
I am almost always interested in learning whatever I can which might pertain to my identity, my capabilities, my identity, my influences, my inhabitants included, etc. so I ask what I can to gain awareness, understanding, perception, detection, and maybe confidence.
Hmm.
How many spirits might you imagine I have?
Well -- first of all -- let's hone in on the word "have".
If I understood him accurately -- I think that Wolf believes that one actually (more or less) possesses his (or her) spirit (or spirits) kinda permanently.
I do not hold to that idea.
I believe that spirits come-and-go.
And -- we do not own (keep) any of them.
Ah. Yeah. Wolf does seem to believe "Animal" (spirit) has been with him from birth.
They are only visitors.
Well.  If that concept works for him (serves him) -- who am I to suggest otherwise.
But my general understanding of spirits -- if that they come-and-go.
     They are only visitors.
/if/  /is/
Okay. Thanks.
What do you think ?
You're welcome.
Maybe we can try to talk more about it SunDay Eve at our usual time, if you could be around then please?
Sounds good to me.
Your 15 minutes expired 3 minutes ago anyway.
üòä
I think you've explained spirits as visitors before and it hasn't stuck with me yet that they might be. I'll try to think about it more though, and get back to you on it.
Yeah. Thanks.
Sun May 9 2021 works for me.
Very glad we could chat today. Sorry I'm busy with the Perl-Conference prepR8ion, but hopefully SunDay or next FriDay Eve, we can chat more deeply again.  üòä
Shall we plan on then ?
Cool. Yeah, let's plan on Sun. May 9th of this Year (2021) to attempt to chat again. Wolf also said to tell you "Hello." and that he's glad you've become a beloved friend of his. Maybe he'll be able to be with me on SunDay too. We'll see.
Ok Pip.
Ja mata.
Ja matta.  üòä
Hello back to Wolf.
L57MKrad
There is only one "T" in mata -- my Japanese teacher tells me.
Thank you for tonight's chat Pip.
I've mostly seen it transliter8d with two "T"s. Maybe just one is preferred now. I studied Nihongo decades ago. You could be correct.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
Have a great evening -- and a very good next 2 days Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
You're welcome Pip.
It's ok Pip.     matta/mata   eether/eyether  -- I know what your mean anyway.
üòä
Good night Son.

Good Evening Dad.
How are you?
Good Evening Philip.
Hmm.
Thank you for asking.
     I'm thinking ...
I'd say I'm good -- except for one thing.
     How are you Pip ?
I am hanging in. I've had quite a few stresses recently (which I don't feel like talking much about right now), but thankfully most seem to be passing.
Yes -- I noticed that on Friday night.
I'm glad they are passing.
Well -- if you'd prefer not to -- I'd be happy to abide by that wish.
However -- frequently -- talking about them -- helps to resolve them.
Thanks.
Entirely up-to-you.
You're welcome.
üòä
What *would* you like to talk about tonight ?
I'm not sure. I have one main topic I'm considering bringing up... but I'm not sure yet if I'm ready to try, so while I think that over, is there anything you'd like to bring up?
Yes thank you.
The one thing that is not good about me tonight (that I had mentioned 8 minutes ago.
Puedo ?
Go.
I'd like permission for a potty break please.
Please feel free to potty whenever you want. You're a big boy!  üòâ
lol
Thank you.
BBSh
Hmm.
I've been thinking about that.
And -- as average tallnesses of the adult male go --
I'm definitely on the lower end.
I am 5'7" in the morning.
5'6¬Ω" in the late afternoon to evening.
Mom is 5'4" -- but I'm not sure at what time of day.
Excuse me. I've lost my phone and am freaking out. I need some time to try to find it.
How about you Pip.
Sure -- go ahead.
     I'll be here.
Found it. Yay! Thanks for your p8ience.
Good for you.
You're welcome.
Where did it hide ?
On my desk in the other room, where I rarely leave it.
Well good.
How tall are you ?
I don't know. Barely ever check or pay it much attention.
lol
Maybe partially, that's because it can fluctu8.
Ok.  Thank you.
Yes -- things do.
You had said:   
"I have one main topic I'm considering bringing up."
     Is that one ready yet ?
No... but I'm contempl8ing another one. Will let you know if either rise to ready.
Okeedoke.
     Thank you.
Okay, maybe ready. Let's try.
Good.     Go for it please.
Convers8ions typically require 2 (or more) parties. If you and your "Father" (i.e., "God") are one being and indistinguishable, how then are you able to converse as distinct, or benefiting sepR8ly from convers8ion together? Something like that.
Xcellent question Pip.
Here'
Whoops.  Let's try that again.
Here's how that works.
He (My Father) and I are one.
Please pause.
But that means "one essence".
Ok -- I'm pausing.              Tell me when to stop (pausing) please.
Why did you submit into chat just there: "Here' " and then "Whoops." Are you typing all your material elsewhere then pasting it into chat all the time? How else would this occur?
Because -- I did not wish to send the    " Here' "
Ah. Nevermind. Double-hit ' and Enter. My bad.
As I typed the apostrophe -- my right pinky also pressed the "Enter" key.
That was the "whoops".
Understood now. Not at first. Please proceed.
No.     Not *your" bad.     *My* bad.
üòä
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
‚ù§
too.
Thank you.
Mmm mmm good.
CampBell's Soup, that?
(Campbell soup commercial)
Yes.
We were both typing that at the same time.
              Great minds !!
Not necessarily.
What ?
Knowing commercials is of limited worth, usually.
You don't believe that you and * both have great minds ?
/*/  /I/
Perhaps. Depends.
Sometimes I don't, at least.
I love commercial jingles.
Well -- what you think of my mind is not important.
I'm ambivalent probably at best about commercials.
But -- what you thing of yours -- *is* !!
Is it time for me to continue on my answering of your question ?
I think my mind is sometimes gr8.
I think your mind is frequently gr8.
But then -- we often disagree on things.
I say frequently.
You say sometimes.
I can live with that.
I can agree frequent sorta too, but sometimes is more pertinent to not over-generalizing with simply 'gr8'. Let's live with them, not really room8 but yeah sometimes and other not-just that.
lol
ok
Excuse me please. I am going to step out for a smoke break. Probably be back in about 10-15 minutes.
Fine with me Pip.
     Enjoy yourself.
          I'll be here.
üòä
üòä
Thanks.
Back.
Hmm.
I very short 15 minutes.
Did you enjoy the smoke ?
/I/  /A/
Some.
lol
You used to smoke inside your apartment -- yes ?
Do.
Is this outside thing a new deal ?
I meant out of my room. Outside sometimes, but not then.
S'ok.   Just wondered.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
May I return to your question now ?
Yep.
Good.
I shall.
 
This was your question:
 
Convers8ions typically require 2 (or more) parties.
If you and your "Father" (i.e., "God") are one being
and indistinguishable, how then are you able to
converse as distinct, or benefiting sepR8ly from
convers8ion together?    Something like that.
 
My answer follows.
 
He (My Father) and I are one.
But that means "one essence".
And that "one essence" means
that we are both God.
 
Yet -- in functionality --
we act as 2 persons.  He is
the "Father" person.  I am
the "Son" person.
 
But now.  Let me address the
"indistinguishable" part of
your question.
 
Occasionally -- we (My Father
and I) *are* indistinguishable.
 
However -- very often (like when
we are in conversation with each
other) -- we are not indistinguishable.
 
You have (here) actually asked a question
which is (very) related to Piece of Light
#2.
Ah. Thanks.
 
As I address in the FTR Script -- which
expatiates on the idea of "Praying on Paper"
-- normally Prayer-on-Paper tends to (mostly)
consist of questions and answers -- and
customarily (but not always) begins with
the Son -- asking his first question of
the Father.
I see.
 
One of the questions that I am nearly always
asked (by one of my FTR students) -- is:
 
When I pray-on-paper -- and I write down
my question -- and then wait for my Father's
answer (which I also write down) -- how do
I know that it was actually Him ?
 
Isn't it possible that my own head -- inserted
that answer which shows up there on the paper ?
 
My answer to my stu is:  Yes -- that is possible.
And -- when you first start doing your praying
on paper -- and for the first several weeks
(maybe) that confusion will be there.  
 
But you will soon find something on your paper
-- that you (absolutely) *know* -- did not come
from you.
 
This is the beginning of your learning to
recognize His voice.  And -- from then on
-- is when you start to "get the goods"
on this "praying on paper" thing.
 
From then on -- it gets valuabler and
valuabler.  And you never want to stop it.
 
(//)
How can such knowledge be absolute though, if you recall you had a time of not knowing, and could not know ahead?
Good question Pip.
And let me answer it by saying this:
 
After your first 21 days of praying-on-paper
(every day) -- you should be able to answer
that question for yourself.
 
If this is not the case -- then
-- ask it of me again please.
 
(//)
Paper has undesirable constraints, compared with text-editor, I find. I also don't do much daily, nor do I think prayer (even on paper) is a legitim8 form for what seems implied by "prayer". Probably have other things to do for 21 days. If I don't know a God, starting to 3-week pray to unknown seems poor order to indic8.
I am not giving this "Piece #2" to you as an assignment Pip.
Ah.
I am simply  ‚Ä¢  answering the question that you asked, and  ‚Ä¢  giving you the "how" of getting into the doing of it -- *if* you should ever choose to.
That's all.
Thanks, then.
üòä
You're welcome then.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thank you for being my teacher.
I try to ‚ù§
you, Dad.
üòä
Thank you too, for teaching me some things as well.
Nope.
You do love me.
You're welcome Pip.
My pleasure.
You had said that you were working on 2 things that you might want to discuss tonight.  
I believe that we just covered one of them.   
Is the other one ready for you to share with me ?
Nah. Maybe another time.
Ok.
Xcellent.
Thank you.
Thank you too.
You're welcome Pip.
üòä
Well have a good night. Probably shoot for Friday night chat again?
Ok.
Friday the 14th - chat.
Thank you for tonight.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
Monday, May 17th, 2021 is Mom's Birthday.

Hopefully we can try to chat again this Friday evening, if we don't connect online even sooner.

Hello Dad.
Good FriDay.
 
         Shabbat Shalom.
 
  (English translation follows)
Whoops -- wrong one.
Yep.   That's better.
 
How be ya Philip ?
Hmm. I had a rough night, a better morning, then this afternoon got pretty rugged again. I'm kinda in a bad mood. Have a lot to do, a lot of pressure, a lot on my mind. How are you?
From the sound of things there -- I guess I'm considerably better than Pip.
Thank you for asking.
What are the pressures on your mind ?
Well the most immediate things are starting game-development job searching again. I have another important online programmer conference starting in 5 days and then another even more critical different conference coming up 2nd week of June.
Sounds exciting.
That latter one will be the annual Perl Conference again (which you helped me prepare my Lightning Talk about Octology for last Year).
But you seemed stressed.
They've approved me to give a 20-minute talk on Octology this Year, so I have a lot of prepR8ion to do and am stressing out about it some of the time.
Why ?
You're good at what you do.
Don't you feel that ?
I've also had a lot of existential questions weighing heavily on my mind, while I'm trying to deal with computer hardware troubles amidst other things needing attention.
I see.
No. Well not exactly. I may be good at what I do, but that doesn't mean I'm good at anything anyone else values (or maybe even ever could).
Hmm.
You've been concerned with that for quite a while -- yes ?
Yes. I have done numerous things that I think are excellent, exquisite, elegant, effective, efficient, esthetic, etc. but nobody else (including you) seems able to appreC8 hardly any of it.
I find high value in you --
simply in being who you are.
Don't you get that ?
Hmm. I guess I do... but this is about a different kind of value. One in things that are done, rather than merely being a self.
Ok.
Valid answer.
What (of all the things that you do / or have done) would you most like to be valued for ?
Advancing the "st8-of-the-art" in Unix (GNU/Linux) user-land configur8ion for programmers, game-developers, and system-administr8ors primarily. Also facilit8ing command-line expertise and approaching maximal mnemonic efficiency and efficacy.
Good.
And are you saying that *no one* applauds you for that ?
Maybe also eventually helping improve many people's vocabularies, mathematical understanding, and faculties with reason and logic generally.
Yes. No one applauds me for that, yet.
Hmm.
I don't really seek applause though.
I'd rather just have users and feedback on how to best improve the system.
If I remember correctly -- in response to your Lightning Talk last year -- 51 different people fed back to you how great it was.
Is that not so ?
Yes. None of them has used any of it though (that I know of). I got no specific feedback. General amazement and enthusiasm... which converted into nobody trying to run any of my code. Total failure!
Hmm.
Have you considered that (possibly) you are just too far above the rest of us -- for us to be able to see the value of what you are offering ?
You've had some of the earliest and most long-standing exposure to the major parts of the system... but you too have run nothing. You don't even ask any questions about any of it. Nobody cares.
I have considered that.
Maybe I can and should do more to better present what's valuable.
I'll vote for that.
I
I'm not yet sure how to do that... but I've got an outline for what I might try differently for this Year.
Would you like to see my outline?
I've been encouraging you in that direction for a long time.
                         Ship the outline please.
~20mPlanB:~1m FairUse CopyRight DisClaimer && BiPolarMania MatureAdult NotSafe4KidsOrWork OffensiveHumor ProfaneBlasphemous TriggerWarning SensitiveSwitchTrax,

  ~1m of return to d8bo && wrapping up how quick && easy it can become to start employing 10 or 20 common colors in almost any uncolored shell or Perl scripts;
Good.
Thank you.
Who else have you shared that with ?
The talk might be called something like: "PipPresents: Octology in 2021, BlackJack Year for WhiteHat/SysAdmins, 20-minutes, 20-colors, and 1 $z zero for reset"
Ok.
I've e-mailed it to Beppu-san this AfterNoon. He said he'll try to provide me some feedback on it soon.
Good.
He's the only other person besides you here that I've shared it with so far.
Good.
Does John understand Octology ?
Beppu-san is already pretty familiar with many of the commands and abbreV8ions I'm using in the outline. I'd expect that a lot of it is in far too cryptic a form for you to be able to decipher much of it yet, without some guidance and assistance.
I agree with that statement.
!
Beppu-san understands a few small portions of Octology. He probably understands more than any one else beyond me so far.
Great.
So -- that's one.
So -- your comment:
He understands small portions, but doesn't really care to use any of it himself. He doesn't see the point of it yet.
 
"I have done numerous things that I think
are excellent, exquisite, elegant, effective,
efficient, esthetic, etc. but *nobody* else
seems able to appreC8 hardly any of it."
    is incorrect then -- as "one" is not *nobody*.
Yep. Nobody appreC8s hardly any of it.
Beppu-san does not appreC8 it. He merely understands small portions of it.
But John does.
Oh.
He knows more about it than anyone else... which is still very little.
I stand corrected.
Thank you.
Welcome.
What is one thing that you have done in the past 10 years -- that you felt appreciated for ?
Communic8ion with you. That's about all I can think of for the past decade so far.
Yes.   And I richly cherish that Pip.
You are a valued friend -- and a great teacher to me.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks Dad. I keep questioning the meaning and value of love, both in general and instantE8d... but I keep trying to be able to say: I ‚ù§
you too, Dad. You seem to say it and mean it sincerely, almost every time we chat. Obviously you feel it enough to put it forth so consistently, and do show it in palpable ways sometimes, that I can recognize and receive and be gr8ful for.
üòä
Good.
Thank you.
You might be the only Skin-Suit who still has any love for me. It usually seems that way.
You're welcome.
Dr. Harman said to me (in October of 1969):
             "One is all you need."
Maybe you only need one person to love you to be able to feel at least slightly loved. I guess so.
He did not expatiate on his statement -- and I never asked him to do so either.         But -- many times in the past 52 years -- I have chewed on his pearl -- and have found many juices to be quite worth savoring.
Please feel free to share more of what you've chewed on regarding this, and whatever it has been that you've considered savory.
Ok.
I shall.
Thank you.
             Here is one of them.
 
First -- let me start with his *exact* quote.
              I had paraphrased it above.
 
He said:  "All you need is one other person."
 
One of the things that I have gotten out of
this idea -- is:  If one person on the earth
expresses love toward you -- then -- this is
proof that you *are* lovable.
 
Now ...
 
As I follow up on that "I am lovable" idea --
I come to the conclusion that:
 
If someone else can love me -- shouldn't
I (also) be able to love me too ?
Perhaps.
 
And   --   of course   --   the answer is:
 
                   Yes !!
(//)
As I've mentioned before though, just because some other person *expresses* love toward you, does not mean that you will necessarily feel loved at all. It might not be expressed in a fashion that reson8s with you measurably.
Also self-love is probably a trickier concept than merely concluding you're "lovable" because another person loves you. Loving another is crucially distinct from self-love, in most ways I gather, so far.
I shall say "noted" to those comments.
Thank you.
Cool. You're welcome.
H'ever -- that does not mean that I (entirely) agree with you.
Understood.
At my current level of personal development -- I have come to a place where I love me enough (today & now) -- that if I feel love from no one else on the planet -- my love of my self is sufficient to hold me to a personal residence of "lifted up".
Yet -- 
I might also add -- I feel loved by hundreds of other people -- every week that I continue breathing.
(//)
Right on. That sounds probably pretty good to me. Loving self (even if nobody else does) is likely beneficial to have be enough to hold you as "lifted up". Glad you feel loved by so many every week though too.  üòä
                               Makes me glad too.
üòä
Nice.
You glad make me Pip.
‚ù§
Thanks Dad. You often make me feel glad too.  ‚ù§
                        Ok.
     That glad makes me too !!
üòä
And -- you're welcome.
So I think I might be winding down, but still can probably stay awake and attentive for a while longer if... well do you have anything on your PCA for tonight?
I do -- a number of them.
     But -- in light of what we have been discussing --
they all feel rather unimportant.
What else is on your mind (heart) tonight ?
Okay. Please feel free to start on any of them whenever you're ready... or we can w8 if they're too unimportant to bring up tonight. Either way is fine.
Hmm. So much on my mind. Hard to even think of where I might try to begin with that one. Uhh...
Ok.     Let me start (then) with the least important one.
Go ahead.
     And maybe that will get you to think of something of value.
The Weather Report.
     Ready ?
Yep.
Ok.
Thank you.
W.R. follows.
 
This Spring has been rather chilly
for its first 2 months so far.
 
This Spring has been rather chilly

May has had a few days in the 70s

Until --

This past Wednesday -- it went up to 87¬∞.
And Thursday & today matched that too. 
 
End of W.R.
(//)
Right on. I thought of something on my mind that maybe I could pose to you. Here goes...
Good.
     Ship it please.
Can time itself take on a human form somehow, and what might be tell-tale signs that it may have done so?
Well -- I see 2 questions.
I'll answer the first one first.
A#1:   Absolutely.   Always.   Sometimes welcome.   Ofttimes not.
Welcome how, by who?
Now -- on Q#2 -- tell me more of what you had in mind please.
Who welcomes time taking on human form though? How does anyone welcome (or not welcome) human time?
Hmm.
Sorry.
I just realized that I misreadd your question.
Scratch my answer please.
Okay.
Here is my RE-answer to Q#1:
I don't know.   ‚Ä¢   What do you think ?
I today started to think that maybe it can. I'm not sure how, why, where, or when it could or might do so though, or want to or not either.
I've wondered if there might be "give-away" signs that time being human might produce, or result in somehow. That's why I included the follow-up question about "tell-tale" maybe in any ways you might anticip8 or expect?
I'm trying to think this through -- but I'm drawing a blank.
That's fine. Thanks for trying.
Can you give me an example of this idea please ?
I probably will need to think about it more and longer too.
I'll try.
You had something in mind -- yes ?
Maybe an example of this idea could be the likelihood that Time (itself) in human form would be able to perhaps easily step out of the present and into any past time and place, and then could l8r re-appear back in the present after visiting a different "when". Like there might be hints that such has occurred, or is occurring now somehow. Maybe there could be like sudden inexplicable disappearance of such a person in the present, or maybe they'd fade into a smoke, vapor, or misty fog or something. Lots of specul8ion. Wild guesses.
Might you have any intuition about what Time as human should be able to do, that most normal people could not?
Comment on Parag #1:   Hmm.   I'll hafta chew on that a bit.
Answer to Q in Parag #2:  Nope.   No intuition yet.   What about you ?
Maybe at least time-travel or banish others to become trapped back in an inhospitable past somehow?
Hmm.     Ok.     Thank you.
You're welcome.
Do you think that bl8antly limited finitude and an absolute infinity can co-exist harmoniously somehow (i.e., without having to destroy the other, in order to remain)?
I would tend to think "yes".     What do you think ?
I tend to think: "Probably no, not able to co-exist harmoniously... but maybe could if each understood the special needs of the other, like with some mutual respect and regard or consider8ion somehow, or something like that."  heh  üòä
Seems to me that you've thought more about this than have I.
I may have.
So -- I think I'd like to "soften" my response -- until I hear more from you on it -- if I may.
I sometimes contempl8 questions of this and similar n8ures.
You may.
Thank you.
     Then -- I shall.
Well I was awake all through last night, and it's after 9PM here now with me getting rather tired, so could this please be a sufficiently fine place to wrap up our chat for tonight?
No.
I think we need about another (circa) 2¬Ω minutes (or so) for "sign-off" stuff.
Can you manage that ?
Yeah. I think I can.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Good.
Thank you.
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
Thank you too.
Thank you Pip.
Thank you for the goood chat.
Target for Fri May 28 2021 ?
Sounds good.
Good.
I'll plan on it.
Stamp me ?
I might have the Docker Conference going on then, but if not, I'll do my best to be available to chat with you around our usual time then, next FriDay eve.
Ok.
Thank you.
Good night Pip.

Hi Dad. Hope you've enjoyed a good Week.
Apparently my friends, Nate && Wolf, need a ride somewhere so I might not be able to be home to chat with you at our usual time (2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime) tonight.
Sorry I need to re-schedule. I expect I should be back home probably around 9PM my time, so around 10PM your time.
Hopefully we can try to catch each other then. If later tonight doesn't work out for either of us, let's try again for our usual time tomorrow (Sat.) or SunDay night instead.
I ‚ù§

Hi Dad. I'm back home && Wolf is here with me. Nate had to stay over at Wolf's place because he has a curfew, but he said to say "Hi!" to you.  üòä
How are you tonight? We're doing pretty well here.
I'm just working on Octology and Wolf is playing a slot-machine game on his phone. Please feel free to send a chat message if you arrive online again. I'll keep checking back to this chat window periodically.
It looks to me like you're online here now, Dad. If so, why haven't you typed anything yet?

Good Evening to you too.
But I have typed something.
Wolf: "Hello."
Even sent you a picture.
Now you have.
lol
You didn't before I asked though.
Hello Wolf.
Details.      Details.      Details.     
Wolf: "I'm glad to be here, to have a convers8ion tonight."
    What does time matter ?
Good to see ya Wolf.
Say "hello" to Nate for me please.
Wolf: "I will."
Wolf: "How have you been since we last talked?"
Thank you.
Terrible.   Just terrible.
     Thank you for asking.
And you ?
Wolf: "I've been top-notch. I had my physical today at the hospital... and I had a very good turn-out. They said I had the body of a 16-Year-Old."
Hmm.
And you think that is goood ?
Wolf: "Oh, very good. Very healthy."
Wolf: "Well, at least 21."
When I was 16 -- my face was full of zits !
I don't think I'd want to go through that again !!
üòä
Wolf: "I never had acne. My face was flawless."
And it still is.
You are flawless all over.
Wolf: "Haha. Hear, hear."
!!
Why have you been "terrible" Dad?
This is an Xcellent question Pip.
     Thank you for asking.
"terrible" is an adjective.
You're welcome.
     and -- most of the time -- people use it to mean: "dreadful".
However -- one of its lesser definitions is signify "extremeness or intenseness -- as with its adverb form "terribly" -- which means "very".
It is much like the word "awful" -- which is also (usually) taken to mean: dreadful.   ‚Ä¢   But "awful" (actually) comes from "awe-full" -- or -- "full of awe" -- awe meaning "wonder" / "surprisingly delightful".
I sometimes say "terrible" -- when asked how I am -- to see if the listener is awake.
And -- good for you Pip.
             You *are* awake.
Nope.
I applaud you !!
Just because I ask something does not mean I'm "awake"!  üòâ
When I say "awake" -- I usually mean:  "paying attention" / "thinking about what is being said".
I know.
I'm not paying attention. I can't afford the expense.
Many (many!) people converse without their mind engaged.
I'm on "auto-pilot" here.
The lights are on -- but nobody's home.
            This is not you Pip.
Sometimes it is me.
Therefore -- I regard you as awake.
Okay. Regard me what you will. Thomas Jefferson, if you like!  üòâ
Hmm.
My longest friend was SSA'd on Tom's 200th Birthday.
Cool!
Mr. Jefferson's SSA was on April 13, 1743.
And.
Neat.
     Speaking of birthdays:
Tuesday is Angie's 43rd Birthday.
It's hard for me to care about her anymore.
This is our "reverse-year".
Her age is my birth-year.
My age is her birth-year.
Ah. I guess that's cool.
I'm pretty sure you're wrong about her being smarter than me.
If she is, it must be too bad she doesn't evidence it.
Your and my "reverse-year" was 2 years ago.
Tim and my -- in 2023.
That's a cool thing to notice.
"Smartness" is not easy to gauge.
Oh, you're wrong about that.
It gets muddled by other traits of the person.
This makes it difficult to fully recognize.
Fully recognize is different from gauge, or merely estim8.
Might be difficult for *you* either way, but not necessarily for everyone, or especially not for me. I'm quite attuned to "smartness".
Just because you and Angie (today) are not close -- does not mean that that will always be the case.
That's true. Things change.
In 1980 -- no 2 people on this earth were "tighter" than you and Ange.
My asshole && her cunt?
     And -- this will be the case again -- in the near future.
I highly doubt it. She's burned bridges with me. Reconciling is unlikely to happen in any near-term I can imagine.
The 2 of you will be reconciled -- when you both decide that you want it.
Not before.
Probably not any near future. She said she'd make sure Darjee was taken care of, then she almost let her die while I was stuck in the mental hospital. It won't be easy for me to forgive her for that.
You always "come back" to that incident -- when we discuss Angie.
     I understand that that hurt you.
But that was my fault -- not hers.
     Have you forgiven me for that ?
I have to run downstairs to discuss something with my neighbor. He just called me and needs to talk for about 10 or 15 minutes. While I'm gone, you can probably type whatever you want for Wolf to read. I should be back shortly.
Ok Pip.
See you in a bit.
üòä
5'05-28-21 - 2351 Gtime / 2251 Ptime
Hey Dad. I'm back. Thanks for w8ing.
So, how could you possibly be at fault for that, and not her somehow?
6'05-29-21 - 0000 Gtime / 2300 Ptime
You are worth w8ing 4 !!
No, I haven't forgiven anyone for that. I'm pretty sure this is the first I've heard you wanting to take credit for such an offense.
Good question Pip.
I've covered this many times before.
But I understand why you keep asking questions on it.
And -- it's entirely ok that you do.
I do not mind repeating it.
I have been teaching since November of 1955 -- and I have (well) learned that my stus need to hear many lessons, multiple times -- before they end up eating the concepts.
L5SMNRIZ  -==-  Fri May 28 23:27:18:35 -0500 2021  <- coming up in ~23mins;
So.   I shall answer it again for you -- gladly.
Concepts are not traditionally mastic8d, or gest8d, or consumed as some ravishing meal or nutrition?
I'll return to that (very last) question later.
But now -- your question was:
     "How could you possibly be at fault for that ?"
Gladness, I call it Strong-Bad-ness, boodyness vs. Bad && gEd vs Evl, I mean Bald-ness?  üòâ
(1)  I and my Father are One.
(2)  Not everything that ever happens in the world is my Father's 
How can you && your "Father" be not yourself && another, claiming to be "One" or just like '1'?
        will (nor, of course mine).
(3)  However.   Nothing can transpire in the world, without Him 
       (and of course, me) "signing off" on it.
Who's got a "Father's" sign8ure?
(4)  So.   When Angie did not attend to the welfare of Darjee
     I (and my Father) had signed off on it.
(5)  Had we not done that -- Angie could not have failed you.
(6)  Bottom line  :::  I am the one who needs your forgiveness -- first.
!4! I didn't see anyone's sign8ure. Who signed what now?!
(//)
!5! How did you know Angie better than I did again?
!6! What have you done though?
(s///;)
9/11 was my fault.
What Hitler did was my fault.
How, dude? How!?
What Manson did was my fault.
What are you talking about?
The list goes on and on.
     All -- my fault.
What "fault" are you talking about as being yours?
All the "bad" things that ever happened in the world --
     were my fault.
They were not my will.
     But -- I signed-off on them.
(//)
I understand that you can't eat (and digest) this right now.
But -- you asked -- so there it is.
Someday -- it will make sense to you.
But -- your time is not yet.
     It's ok Pip.
          I can wait.
I ‚ù§

I try to ‚ù§
too Dad, but it's maybe not "time" yet.
No ‚ù§

Well, I guess good (or bood) noches, Papa!  üòä
What ?   You don't want my weather report ?
Ah. Okay, please feel free to produce that, if you'd like to? I was thinking you burned out on the discourse.
lol
It started raining a little after noon today.
And it's supposed to continue for 2¬Ω more days.
End of W.R.
Thank you. Glad you take note of stuff you find worthy.
Weather ?     Worthy ?
     I'm not sure "worthy".     Just sometimes interesting.

Fair enough. Interest can be bood, probably more than gEd.
So -- how was your week ?
And -- how is your Octology coming along ?
I'm working toward "Yx", but I think "Wex" will maybe bridge (Anti-Alphab8ical ShdC Pip!).
It's cumming all over the fscking place!@#
Wolf: "No matter how you talk or what you say, you're still my friend... as silly as it may seem to me, but I hold no judgment."
Thank you Wolf.

Wolf: "Haha. I only think this way when I'm stoned... or well I'm buzzed, thank you.  üòä
'Nothin'! 70..7 cents.' "
/Wolf looks at his phone more intently...
Wolf: "Wow! 90 cents... fifty..."
Wolf: "... like Wolverine or Saber-Tooth!! HaDouKen!"
Wolf: "... Wolf recognizes the chat missed && then pauses from game to say: 'Oh! Thank you very ... No matter how you speak, with your beliefs and all... I'm like I said, Wolf. I'll sit here and listen to anything you have to say. Just give you someone to talk to. New words just come *out* (about?) the same way... supposedly?' ";
It has become very quiet here in Pennsylvania.
Have you anything else on your PCA for tonight Pip ?
Hmm.
Hmm ?
Sorry, was watching Xilent BossWave && now IsThereTime... "StandBy!"
Also drawing some stuff. Want to see? I would have to export to PNG format, but could probably do it pretty quick if you wanted?
I'll just toss it your way... and you can jump clear of the blast-radius before it deton8s, okay?  üòâ
      Yep.   I'd like to see it.   Ship it please.
It's some ideas I've had.
Thank you.

Hi Dad. Sorry I'm a little l8.
Been busy trying to prepare for my talk on WednesDay, and lost track of the time.
Well, sorry it seems I have missed you this Evening, but I still have a bunch of challenging things I need to work on, and am rapidly running out of time to address... so I guess since HangOuts.Google is indic8ing that you were last active about 21-minutes ago, I will keep trying to work on my present8ion material here, and will also try to check back here about every half-hour or so, to see if you've come back on-line and might be ready to chat some when I'm available l8r too.

How was your week ?
Gut Shabbos Papa.
üòä
Um pretty stressful. I have way too much to do before my talk could possibly go well. I'm trying not to panic, and struggle to keep making any progress. Thanks for asking. How was your Week?
Ok.   Thank you for asking.
     When is your "Talk" due ?
I'm scheduled to deliver my 20-minute talk on Octology on WednesDay AfterNoon at (I think it is) 1600 Gtime / 1500 Ptime. I may need to check again for exact confirm8ion. If you can afford the $10 Perl/Raku Conference-in-the-Cloud 2021 particip8ion fee, you could probably watch my present8ion live yourself then if you wanted to (assuming I actually pull off giving the talk successfully).
Wednesday the 9th ?
Yep.
Do you have a preview for me ?
I wish I did. I very much wanted to be prepared to show you at least a recorded "take" of the first-half ~10-minutes to be able to show you tonight && get some feedback from, but alas... I could not get it together by now to have done that. Maybe tomorrow night I will have a preview to show. I'll keep trying.
Ok.   Good.
Well -- I had a few things to chat about for tonight.
But --
none are "hot".
Cool.
However -- so as not to add to your stress --
shall I let you get back to your Talk-crafting --
and we'll shoot for tomorrow night ?
Nice, Dad. That's very consider8 of you. Thanks muy mucho! Do you think we might be able to please... yeah, let's shoot for chatting again tomorrow evening at our usual time.

Good Saturday Evening Philip.
I didn't get my act together enough today to record a candid8 talk to share with you yet.
But some progress -- yes ?
I may keep trying after we're done chatting tonight, or tomorrow. Some progress, yes. Thanks for asking.
Well good.
     Some is better than none.
üòä
Usually, yeah.
In case I am not available at
the (precise) "live" time --
it can be viewed later -- yes ?
Possibly.
There's a non-zero chance that they will let me talk live again but then not allow it to be viewed after (like they did last Year).
GOP
At least not on the Conference site. My last Year's talk has still been available on my YouTube channel, but hardly anyone could care to view it in the past Year. Had it been on the Conference channel with all the others, it probably would have seen much more attention.
Why were the others "on" -- and yours not -- last year ?
Because they found mine offensive and in viol8ion of their "Code-of-Conduct" rules (which are vague and non-specific).
How so ?
I did not find it offensive.
It had the words: "Penocha" and "Sex" in it.
Just a few seconds at the end, in my manic credits.
Oh yes.   Well -- Pip should have known better.
     You will omit those words this year -- yes ?
Probably not.
I'm a rebel. I was born to break rules.
Well -- I know that.
     But --
          Don't you wish to be "seen" more than break rules ??
Somewhat.
Answer is not acceptable.
You will have to decide one way or the other
Sorta.
-- before Wednesday.
You complain that Octology is hardly appreciated --
but you made it "not widely viewable" last year.
Wrong!
Do you want it appreciated -- or not ?
Both.
Am I being to harsh ?
/to/  /too/
Perhaps.
Ok.
I'll back off.
I ‚ù§

Love is grotesquely overr8d.

Happy Friday to you too Philip.
How am I ?
I have been better.
     But I am perfect                      and happie.
Ah. Good.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
And thank you (also) for your "Wednesday" offering.
     How do you feel about it ?
Yeah.
          Yeah ?
That's how you feel aabout it ?
I would like to know how you feel about it.
I am not finished writing up my notes on it --
but I would like to hear you (on it) before I share my comments please.
/you/  /your/
Okay. I look forward to reading your notes on it, as soon as you consider them ready.  üòä
no          "you" was correct.     Sorry.
Okay. Well I haven't prepared much analysis yet, but I feel as though it went decently. It could have gone better, but it also could have gone a lot worse. I am mostly contented with how it turned out.
Good for you.
Do you feel that it went better than last year's edition ?
Probably... at least in some ways.
Which ?
ways ?
I feel that this Year went probably better than last Year, at least in some ways, like probably some better explan8ion of things that should have been easier to grasp. Much more narrow focus this Year. Last Year was scarcely cohesive.
I agree with all that.
Did you find this Year to be better than last Year?
Good Pip.
     What else ?
Thanks.
I'm not sure what else yet. I probably need to think about it more.
You're welcome.
     Thank you.
I'm still decompressing from the stress of prepR8ion and show-time nervousness.
Yes -- I noticed some stress & nervousness --
during your talk -- but it did not (at all) --
turn me off -- or make me want to change the channel.
However.   I am surprised that now --
Good to learn. I'm glad. Thanks.
even 2 days later -- that you are still 
suffering from it.
     What is that all about ?
You're welcome Pip.
The Conference continued yesterDay, and I attended several sessions then too, without much relief from my performance. Then I got a lot of good sleep last night and this morning, and am beginning to return to something like an equilibrium.
Well then -- I am certainly glad for that.
     Good.
Yeah. There sure was a lot of anticip8ion I had built up prior to this WednesDay.
That's to be expected.
     And (quite a bit) normal.
If I get another chance to present more next Year, hopefully I can spend more time getting even better prepared for that. Giving good talks probably takes a significant amount of practice.
It's so widespread that it has a name:
     "Performance Anxiety"
Yep. I sure had much of that, and some lingers still.
Yes -- I understand the "before" --
but I am quite confused by the "after".
Most people do not have the "after" --
I got so increasingly nervous as the d8 approached that I am still in a bit of disbelief that it's actually over.
no matter how bad the "before" was.
Well it is "over".
Yeah. I did what I could.
     And I think:  you done good.
Thanks Dad.  üòä
You're welcome Pip.
                 All of the :::
               should be behind you now.
üòä
It's waning.
Good.
               Come on                             wane !!
Well is there anything else you'd like to discuss tonight?
Yes -- quite a bit -- but more on your "talk" please.
You first.
What about it?
Anything that you especially feel that you did well ?
Hmm. Not sure yet. Need to think about it more.
Ok.   Do that please.
I guess I used up the whole time and went long, with barely any pauses in my speaking about my material.
I included a lot of detail (probably too much, which I can work on).
I disagree.   Isn't "detail" the important part of these talks ?
To some extent, yes... but I am prone to go into excrucE8ing detail, which is tedious, excessive, uninteresting, and unnecessary.
You are focusing on the "7" of Piece of Light #19.
There's a balance to it, which I probably don't have much of yet.
The "5" of that Piece of Light is very important too.
And -- I'm not hearing you tell me any of --
what you think that you did well on.
This is important !!
I think I did well using up the time. It might have been worse to run out of things to show or say.
I spoke clearly too. I think I was audible, intelligible, enunC8ing well, etc..
Yes.
Good.
I (whole-heartedly) agree on those points.
     Good Pip.
And -- on the "enunC8ing" thing --
I (especially) noticed that:
very unlike 98¬Ω% of the English-speaking
population of the world --
You pronounce "etc" correctly.
     ETSETERA
          not
Cool thing to notice. I *do* try to pronounce almost every word as correctly as I am able.
     EKSETERA !!
One of the things that I so love about --
the you that you have become -- it your
attention-to-detail -- in every area
of your life.   And -- in communication --
(talking to people) -- it is so (very) important.
Most people do not work on this.
And -- our schools do not make 
a big deal of it anymore.
Yeah.
Just another (big) reason why 
I am 110% (always) in favor of:
     "Home Schooling".
But -- don't get me started on that subject.
     We'll be here until the middle of next month !!
üòä
Okay. "Home Schooling" can be discussed another time.  üòä
/it/  /is/
What else on your Wednesday Talk ?
I don't know yet. I will probably try to scrutinize it and learn from it throughout the next Week.
Then (maybe) I should withhold my comments
until you do that.
I really don't want to influence your
own critique -- by pre-telling you my comments.
Yes ?
I have mine written down.
I will not forget them.
I don't think your comments are likely to adversely influence my own critique, but suit yourself if you'd rather withhold them. I'm accustomed to getting little to no feedback on my present8ions.
I understand that.   But -- you always  get 
"FB" from me -- because you ask for it.
However -- please understand that 
I press the "you first" thing -- because:
(quite often): one's own critique
is the most important "FB" that
one can ever get on anything.
Yeah. Okay.
     It's about "trusting-the-self" --
and learning that most wisdom
comes from within -- not
from without.
And -- if I might add -- you (Pip)
tend to find a lot of darkness
within you -- but I see so much
light there -- and constantly
encourage you to find it too.
You are *full* of light.
But -- it dooz you little good
Wow. Yeah, I do find a lot of both darkness and light (metaphorically) inside of myself. I doubt I am *full* of either though.
-- if you see it not.
(//)
Recognizing the darknesses within are a big
part of why we were put here on the earth.
So that we can replace them with light.
This is an expansive subject.
And I shall be happy to share 
much more on it.   But best done
in response to when you ask
specific questions on it.
             I can w8.
Cool. I don't think we were "put" here in the first place, but we can w8 to discuss this until I might l8r ask specific questions on it, I guess.
I guess                                                           too.
lol
üòä
üòä
Are we done with your "Wed Talk" for now ?
     Or ...  ?
I think so.
Ok.
Thank you.
I shall expect you to review (and chew) on it --
and bring me more on it soon.
     Yes ?
Perhaps.
I am not sure I will have more on it to bring you l8r.
If I do, I will.
Well.   I want to share all of my
comments on it -- with you --
as I believe you would like to hear.
But -- I also believe that you can
Yeah, okay. Please share all your comments whenever you think they're ready.
easily find more within it yourself.
They *are* ready.
In the interest of 2036 -- I am trying to
get you ready for trusting yourself
-- when consulting me on a Friday
night -- will not be as easy.
Well -- 2036 / 2037 / whenever.
Thanks for trying to get me ready for whatever times ahead that consulting you will not be as easy (for whatever reason).
Each of us is scheduled to stop breathing -- and Surrender our SkinSuit.
We just don't know (exactly) when that is coming.
That's what I was eluding to.
(//)
I figured.
Yes you did !!
       You're no dommie.
If we don't know when something is, is it fair to call it "scheduled"?
What a grreat question Pip !!
(applause goes here)
And -- I already know -- that you already know -- my answer.
üòä
Okay, well shall we get into whatever else you had on your PCA for this evening?
Yepper.
Thank you.
Let me look over my list.
BBSh
Back
Cool.
Ok.   Shall we start with:   "The Month of June"   ?
Okay.
Okeedoke.
Thank you.
We shall.
 
     "The Month of June" follows.
 
I've been thinking about June --
since our "Friday, May 28th, 2021"
chat, 2 weeks ago   -- and --
I believe this month holds (about)
5 anniversaries of note for me.
 
  
Besides Angie's 43rd anniversary
(of her SSA on June 1st, 2021)
-- your S-Aunt Janet will also
be celebr8ing her 75th on Tuesday,
June 15th -- in Branson, Missouri.
Cool.
  
Plus -- tomorrow -- Saturday, June 12th,
2021 -- is 60 years since I graduated
from Daniel Boone High School -- in the
609-seat auditorium of our Junior High
School building, in Birdsboro, Pennsylvania
-- although the High School was actually
4¬Ω miles to the northeast, in Amityville PA.
 
 
And, this June is also the 50th anniversary
of my graduation from Los Angeles City
College (shown above) -- in addition to
52 years since I met your Mom at the
"Nice Cream" stand in the La Cienega
Fedco Department Store -- in Los Angeles,
in 1969.
 
Hmm.  Speaking of Janet Lennon
-- another note on her.
 
 
She (and her 3 older Sisters) first appeared
on The Lawrence Welk Program -- on Saturday,
December 24, 1955.  They sang "He" -- as the
photo from that performance is shown above.
 
Janet was (then) just 9¬Ω years old.  I was 12.  
Her Sister, Kathy, was also 12 -- as Kathy is
just 6 days older than I.  
Right on.
 
              ‚Ä¢  Kathy's SSA: Mon Aug 2 1943.
              ‚Ä¢  Gerry's SSA: Sun Aug 8 1943.
 
 
Janet was always my favorite, as well as Mr.
Welk's favorite dancing partner on the show
-- and, as the 4 girls went on to guest-star
on various other television shows (throughout
the coming decades) -- they not only sang
(which was the root of their fame) -- but
they also played in countless skits.
 
And, because of Janet's holding the
"Darling Baby" status of The Sisters
-- she usually got the funniest lines
in those skits.
 
How cool!  üòä
 
Here are 2 of my favorites:
 
Here are 2 of my favorites:
 
        The first -- with Jack Benny (photo above)
            -- on Saturday, February 14, 1970
            (Jack's 76th birthday).
 
        The second -- with Sammy Davis Jr.
            -- on Thursday, December 13, 1973
            (Philip's minus-3rd birthday).
Nice.

üòä
 (//)
Thanks. I may watch those l8r. The descriptions and images are enough for now.  üòä
They are only a 3:27 watch.
You can do them now.
I'm headed for the potty.
üòä
Potty away!  üòâ
Thank you.
Ok.   I'm all pottied out.
Comments on the clips ?
Nope. I said I'd possibly watch them another time. I'm not as fond of the Lennons as I used to be, so would rather not see all that much of them for now.
Ok.
You're D boss.
Comments on your potty?
I'm not as fond of going potty as I used to be -- so would rather not make any definitive comments on that operation for now.-- if that's ok with you.
Okay. I'm fine without your comments.  üòâ
This was me -- before I grew the beard.
üòä
üòä
  Lookin' good. Probably had to climb up there with some difficulty.
Correct.   I suppose you remember that challenge as well.
In the western bathroom in your 2nd home:
I don't remember that challenge much.
     547 North 9th Street in Reading, Pennsylvania.
July 1977 (age 7 months) to March 1981 (age 4¬º years).
Then we moved to Bakersfield.
By then you were tall enough that the "climb"
was no longer a challenge.
üòä
I said "western" bathroom -- because that was the one that most of us always used -- on the second floor.   We also had an "eastern" quarter-bathroom -- on the first floor.   But that was nearly never used by any of us.
Ah.
Of course -- in those days -- Timmy *never* used any bathroom !!
     He had an alternate venue for going potty.
üòä
Yep.
Tim was just 8¬Ω months old when we moved to Bakersfield.
Whoops.
No.
Sorry.
5¬Ω.
Mighty tiny dude !!
Yeah.
Now:  5'11" 
I think I'm about 5'8" tall. Approxim8ly how tall are you usually?
I am 5'7" in the morning.
       5'6¬Ω" in the afternoon.
    (spinal compression)
Mom & Ange are 5'4"
Tim is 5'11"
Yeah. I probably get down near 5'7" after erect for hours.
Probably more like on 5'7¬Ω"
Could be.
A drop of one whole inch would be nearly 1.5%
-- and the average compression is only about 0.8%
-- so ¬Ω inch is generally the norm.
It also varies slightly -- based on activity.
Joggers compress a bit more than walkers.
Makes sense. I probably spend most awake time sitting, without all that much standing or walking, so maybe my compression is lessened from that too.
But we're getting into the splitting of hairs area here.
Pretty insignificant.
üòä
Yeah. We both seem to be quite the "hair-splitters" sometimes though too. Pedantry runs in our genes!  üòâ
             Yes.     I case that is probably the think.
üòä
Thank you for giving me my genes Pip.
Any time!  üòâ
Levi stock was selling at $27,25 per share today.-- up 2.44% from yester.
Aha.
Next PCA ?
Okay.
I found some interesting family photos recently.
Quite a few beauties actually.
I might not share them all with you just today.
Fine.
But -- there is one that I love love love.
Maybe you remember it.
I'm not sure where it was taken.
But the date was Sunday, October 8, 2006.
 
Maybe you'll remember it.
 
 
                    Pip(29) Ange(28) Mom(54) Tim(26)
I remember the photo well, but the time it was taken only vaguely at this point.
Was it (maybe) in Santa Barbara ?
We're all looking at another photographer presumably. Could be. Not sure quite where we were. Maybe SB.
I don't know if you have a copy of it.
But you can now download it from here.
Thanks. Just did.
It is so sweet for (at least) 2 reasons.
(1)   You are all together.
(2)   You are all happy campers.
You're welcome Pip.
Of course -- this was before Tim's 4 children.
Not sure if it was before (of after) he met Mandy.
Tim and Amanda met Years before 2006, at U.C.S.B. together, probably about 7 Years earlier than when that photo was taken.
Ok.    Thank you.
They weren't together that whole time. They were on-again, off-again, for quite a while. You're welcome.
He was at UCSB from 1998 to 2002 ?
Sounds about right.
Ok.   Thank you.
B.S. in Chemical Engineering ?
I'm not sure.
S'ok.
Not important.
Did you ever get a name & date-of-birth for their 4th child ?
Nope. No contact with them.
I only have the first 3.
That's ok.
Thank you anyway.
Sent a letter l8 last Year, but no response.
Do you have their current address ?
They moved a few years back.
I'm pretty sure the names are something like: Finley, Emerson, Duke, and Crew. Maybe wrong though.
I have the address you provided me to send my letter to probably last November or December. I forget.
The first 3 *are* Finley, Emerson, and Crew.
Possibly then -- based on what you just said -- Duke is the 4th.
Possibly.
Yep then.   The Nov 2020 address I gave you is the current one.
Cool.
I call them:   Katy,   Emmy,   Paul,   Quad.
"Quad" -- because I don't know his name -- but he is their 4th child.
All I know about Quad (Duke) is that he was born in 2015.
But that's not really enough to send him a BD card.
i only send mail to their place 7 times per year.
And none of those are highly substantive.
I never really say much -- and never ask any question.
Ah.
I send a BD card to 5 of them (without Quad).
I send an anniversary card to Tim & Mandy.
And -- I send a calendar to "The Whole Family".
I sign them all "I love you" -- and add nothing else.
I don't want to "wrinkle their feathers" --
but I do want them all to know that
I love them, I think of them often, and
Yeah. That's probably thoughtful.
they may have more of me --
at any time that any of them wish.
üòä
By the same token -- Angie, Mom & Rosie -- and Ginny & Dan (also) all get "no major substance" birthday cards.
I'm here -- and I love you -- and I think about you
-- is the whole package.
Someday -- this will change.
Yeah. That's probably enough, when they don't have any response or concern yet.
Maybe they will change, and so can your package "substance".
But -- if it is not until after I have Surrendered my SkinSuit -- that is fine with me.
                               All is perfect.
üòä
You "showed up" in April of 1996.
Each will do likewise at the perfect time.
If you want any other photos -- you can let me know when you do.
Thanks. More another time should be good.
Yesterday -- I got a neat one of Katy in October of 2018 -- at age 8.9.
But -- as you just said -- that one (and others) can w8 until "another time".
Well have we arrived at a pretty good time to wrap our chat up for tonight and can we please plan to try to chat together again next FriDay at our usual time?
Well -- I did have 26 more PCAs that I had hoped to cover this evening.
But -- I guess they can wait another week.
So -- yes -- ok.
You are the boss, My Son.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thank you for this nice chat.
Hehe. Sorry so many PCAs may have to w8 another week, but I'm glad they can. We can look forward to getting into more of them then.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
I'll plan on Fri Jun 18 2021 then -- at R.T. (regular time).
You're welcome, and thank you for this nice chat too.
You're welcome Pip.
And thank you too.
Sounds good. Have a gr8 rest of your night, Weekend, and Week ahead.  üòä

Hi Dad.
L6JMJ5xo
Good Saturday Evening Philip.
Wolf says: "Hi."
I understand that your Dad
     was a "no show" last evening.
Hi Wolf.
Yep. Hope you're doing okay?
Happy (Early) Father's Day!  üòä
The reason he gives is akin
     to the photograph above.
And he asks for your forgiveness.
             Is that possible ?
Sweet. Of course no need for forgiving napping. Healthy!  üòä
  ‚ù§
Thank you so much    ‚ù§
 .
Wolf: "I agree."
Thank you Wolf.
So -- I guess that means that I am double-forgiven.
      Wooh !!
üòä
Yeah.
And what would the Oshkosh Brothers like to talk about tonight ?
I have 2 PCA items. You have some?
Only 38.
Let's do yours first.
Go.
Okay. 0) BlackJack Talk Notes?
That looks like a question --
but I don't know what it is asking.
        Help please.
You said you had notes about my talk that were first not ready, then said to be ready but still w8ing for another time for presumably some other reason then. What were they?
This is correct.   H'ever -- I also said that I was --
w8ing for more of yours.
You have those ready yet ?
Ah, yeah. Nope. More of mine are not ready. I guess nevermind about my item 0 then. Whatever.
Well.   Then I guess I should ask:
Did you plan to gather some more
Wolf: "Please do. I want to hear what you have to say."
comments of your own --
or do you not wish to do that ?
Sort of, but I more planned to do other better things since then, or so they seem.
I must I admit -- I'm not sure where we --
are on all this.   I'm getting the impression --
that you do not want to further self-assess --
your Talk --
but you wish to hear my comments.
         Is this correct -- or ??
No. Further self-assessing is probably good, but I just haven't really attended to it much with other more pressing things being present.
Yeah. Please share your comments.
Ok.
Let me go get them.
BBSh.
Okay. Take your time.
back
Cool.
‚Ä¢  Your "Intro" was a nice touch.
   Good job Pip.
Thanks.
Thought I might need some "elbow-room" doing a live-stream during the talk.
Yes.
You're welcome.
 
‚Ä¢  You're right.  The idea of abandoning
   decimal *is* a hard sell.
Ooh. Nice comment!  üòä
You're welcome.   üòä
Perceptive.
Thank you.
 
‚Ä¢  I liked that you (cursorily) explained
   your 8 "clock" characters ...
    However -- I wanted more on that -- and
    I suspect I was not alone on that desire.
Okay.
What more might you inquire about then?
Or should we not follow that thread just yet and we can get into more talk details instead?
Hey.   We are here now.   Let's do it now -- yes ?
Okay.
Good.
Let's start this way  :::
Give me your stamp for this moment please.
L6JMJTAG
Great.
Thank you.
Now --
Tell me exactly what you told us --
in your Talk about your stamp.
I'd have to consult the transcript to recover that. Do you want me to do so?
Please.
BBiaB
Take your time.
        I shall be here.
üòä
Okay. I found it at dur8ion: A30
My clock in the lower-right can be zoomed on. "I'm so fast!" about 4-seconds before the d8-time of the talk L69MFAST clicked by in view.
I'm confused.   What did that last message mean ?

Turn on the Auto-Gener8d U.S.English transcript on the video and wind to 10-minutes, 3-seconds you'll see what I started reiter8ing on.  https://YouTube.Com/watch?v=FgS6IXq-xVE
Ok.   Yes.   That is where you told us about your stamp.
Now -- what I am asking you is --
what did you tell us about your stamp ?
Number them please.
The things you told us.
You number them, please. I have the transcript in front of me.
Do you need it? I can e-mail it to you if you can't open the transcript yourself at that link too.
I guess I'm being dense here.
Sorry Pip.
When you say "transcript" --
Dense is okay sometimes.
Closed-Caption "CC" button on YouTube interface over videos it plays?
You're not acquainted with that? Why not?
do you mean your "25:09" talk ?
Yeah. CC.
"Open Transcript" off the ellipsis-button.
In your Talk -- you talk about your 8-char clock --
from 10:03 to 10:28.
What I have been asking you is --
How many things did you tell us --
about your clock ?
1 - 
2 - 
3 - 
et cetera
I didn't count. You can.
It's ok.
You don't have to.
I did.
So -- is there anything else we --
need to discuss about this item --
or should I share my next comment now ?
I guess not. You sounded like you had a question, but then gave one that was a trivial thing for you to do which I had had no reason to do so, yeah done. Fine.
Ok.   Here is my next one.
 
‚Ä¢  Although you prepped us (in your Intro)
    -- I did not notice any "cursing" in your
    Talk.  So.  On that -- you did very well.

 
     (applause goes here)
Thanks. Yeah. Prepared to swear my sailor-loving head off, then didn't need it. Beppu-san said should've left it out. Think maybe he's right it'woulda been better to have.
lol
John's a smart man.
üòä
üòä
You can say that again. Indeed. Agreed.
John's a smart man.
                    Again ?
John's a smart man.
Sorry.
           Now I'm just being silly.
(//)
Silly is good to be usually, I'm pretty sure.
Thank you mes eleves.
               =)
             üòä
So do you have more comments on material or present8ion?
Nope -- those were all the mains.
What else was on your PCA for tonight ?
You ready?
                             Eye                 yam.
Is it mostly your fault that I look like Jesus (or maybe He looks like me more)?
Ship it please.
Hmm.   I don't ever remember saying that you "look like" Yeshua.
Help me with this please.
I'm saying I do. Why?
Leonardo DaVinci, many other artist's renditions or depictions of Jesus (not Y'shua so much) seem to resemble me gr8ly, like sometimes kind of "spitting-image". Weird. Hard to make sense of.
Well -- I don't believe any drawings from artists, who never saw Yeshua (in person) can be considered to be anything near an accurate shot at what he looked like.
Beside the point.
I'm sorry.
What was the point ?
I guess I missed it.
Why do *I* look like "him" or does he look like me?
I don't know that you *do* look like Yeshua.
Therefore -- I cannot really speak to the question.
What do you think ?
Okie dokie. Perplexed me, but cool if you have no idea either, I guess. What ev's.
I see God *in* you.
I know nothing about any significance of skinsuits.
Why do you lie and say you can "see" something that cannot be seen?
Ok.   If you do not like the word "see" -----
I perceive God in you, Philip.
         Is that better ?
If you mean anything like the crazy spiteful tantrum-throwing "God" of the Bible, if you think you "see" it in me, you're super seeing what isn't there!
GOP
I've asked about what I look like. I don't care about your "see" or "perceive" right now. If I wanted those, I'd ask those.
I don't know what you look like.
I guess I should have answered it that way in the first place.
Sorry Pip.
Think classic "Jesus" portr8 art. That's what I've asked.
Ah ha.
Then my answer is:  I don't know.
Okay. Please let me know if you find an idea.
Ok.   Wilco.
Cool. Your PCA then?
None of the 38 are hot.
But --
               I did want to thank you for the Happy Father's Day.
Thank you Pip.
Welcome.
Your wishes to me are like a sweet bouquet of fiorini !!
Nice.
                  (that's "flowers" in Italian)
Yes.   You are nice Pip.
                Thank you.
You're welcome. Glad you are celebr8d for being the Dad you can be.  üòä

               But nice.
How 'bout there ?
Wolf: "70 with about 65% humidity."
Very nice.   Yes -- the humidity  is
Wolf: "The plants like it... but it's too hot for me. I don't."
quite comfortable here too.
     More on that in "The Weather Report" too.
70 is too hot ???
For Wolf, yeah.
He likes WisConSin WinTers!
Ah so.
Duly noted, Wolf.
Wolf: "Yeah. Give me 20's to 4-below-zero and I'm comfortable... in shorts and no shirt."
Wooh !!!                     NO          THANK           YOU.
You may have it Wolf.
üòä
You had asked how I am.
     Thank you.
          Today -- I am fine.    Perfect.
Wolf: "I hope you're doing good."
And quite happy too.
     Thursday & Friday, I was perfect too.
Wolf: "That's good to hear. So am I. I'm surviving."
          But -- my happiness was not so high.
A long story.    Maybe later.
W: "Sad to hear that."
Good for you Wolf.
No.   Be not sad for me.   Everything has a purpose.
     All is perfect.
W: "Okay."
However -- most people refuse to look for the goodnesses --
I must disagree. Not everything has a purpose. All is *not* perfect.
in the sadnesses in life -- which frequently come to visit us.
Some things have no purpose, or more than just one!  üòâ
My Thursday & Friday were extremely painful.
But the lesson couched within the experience --
held value which I (probably) could not --
W: "Okay. As long as it all came out well. Experience is good."
have received, through any other means.
And today -- the pain is all gone --
Good. We're both glad to hear that.
     but the wisdom I gained through it --
          can stay with me forever --
if I am smart enough to keep chewing on it.
I doubt you'll be around forever.
Few things (alive or otherwise) are absolutely permanent.
Around forever ??
Depends on what you mean.
For wisdom to stay with you forever, you'd have to last that long. Probably not feasible.
Of course -- we shall be tossing my
skinsuit to the trash before long -- yes.
But -- I am forever.
I began lonnng before my skinsuit appeared.
How could you know that?
And -- I shall remain forever after you --
Wolf: "So have I. Thousands of Years."
can look upon it.
We are not creations.
We were the creator.
Wolf: "Actually we're not from this Earth... originally."
Just because you do not remember doing --
something -- doesn't means that you could not have.
Correct Wolf.
If you can't remember doing, how can you declare without qualific8ion that you began lonnng before your skin-suit appeared?
We just created the earth for a temporary:
    (1)  Schoolroom                    and
    (2)  Playground.
Great question Pip.
Because My Daddy told me.
How can you know Your Daddy knows?
     And Daddy don't speak with fork-ed tongue !!
I and my Daddy are One.
Doubtful.
If you were truly "One", then there would be nothing for Him to have "told" you.
This is review.
But -- you never ate it before.
Indeed. I just need to maintain my protest.  üòâ
So -- it bears repeating again.
He and I are One essence.
One spirit.
And that spirit is Love.
Wolf: "I disagree. You do not have a spirit that is One with God. God doesn't exist."
However -- to keep life interesting -- and especially
fun -- we (who are really One) function
as if we are 2 persons.
(//)
Hmmph!
lol
     I ‚ù§
 your comment.
lol
üòä
Heh.  üòä
I've been teaching for 66 years --
and " Hmmph!" is one of the most
Wolf: "I've been teaching humans ways of life... all my life. I'd say 60-Years."
valuable responses I ever get from my stus.
               I love it !!
Very nice!
Wolf: "I've taught the art of love, and forgiveness."
Of course you have, Wolf.
     Love - - - - - - - is what you are !!
And -- your forgiveness -- is a very
function of your having been the
world's Creator.
           You are perfect Wolf.
W: "Ah!"
W: "I'm not perfect. I have my faults... but I try not to let 'em out. Haha."
The word "perfect" -- the way i (most often) use
if -- and the way that it is defined morphologically -
does not mean "flawless".
"per"  means  "complete" or "completely"
"fect"  comes from the Latin "facto" -- and means "to make" or "made"
When I say "perfect" -- I am not suggesting "flawlessness".
I am saying that you are "completely made".
You lack nothing.
I insist that perfect does, at the very least, suggest "flawlessness" though.
You are perfect today -- for today.
Tomorrow -- you shall be *even better* !!
Wolf: "Thank you very much!"
But -- both days -- perfect !!
Pip.   Good call.   You (and tons of others like you)
wish to -- and do -- use the word "perfect" --
to mean flawlessness.
W: "But there's only one Pip... and he's my friend."
     And that's fully ok with me.   I understand you.
The only thing that I ask -- is that you understand --
that I am on "a different line" in the dictionary --
when I use it.
     That's all.
üòä
Okay.
Okay.
You *do* use lots of words in anomalous ways... pretty routinely. Maybe I should try harder to get used to it, one of these eventual Years, right?!  üòâ
üòä
lol
I like that idea Pip.
I do not expect you to agree with my sayings.
We'll work towards it.
I (merely) hope that you grasp what I mean when I say them.
Good for you Pip.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You are not flawless.
Neither am I.
W: "Same here."
And I celebrate both of those.
Yep.   Same for you Wolf.
üòä
W: "I'm modest. Hahaha."
I guess it should depend on what we consider a "flaw", in order to ascertain whether any of us could validly be considered "flawless", eh?
Well -- the jury's still out on that Wolf.
üòä
This is correct Pip.
W: "Hahahehe. Very funny! LoL."
I consider my over-eating a flaw.
But -- for today -- it is still perfect.
W: "I under-eat... but I'm still 256!"
If you say so Wolf.
But -- I like you better at 256 than at 270.
Wolf: "Here, here."
So -- what you consider a flaw -- I see as:
"right-on-the-money".
Dad, if you could please, would you re-load my BlackJack talk video in your browser and please rEad the comments posted beneath it, then respond with your thoughts? Wolf likes it a lot. He thinks it was "perfectly done".
Wolf: "I think Pip's Octology should go into Space-Ships!"
Is that the one you gave to The Perl Conference on June 9th ?
W: "... along with Binary-Code."
It is. Yep. Just toDay noticed a comment was posted, so I replied and would like your thoughts, please?
Send me the link again please ?

I have it loaded -- but am not finding comments.
I see only 2 paragraphs from you -- below the video.

Scroll down a little and the comments should appear beneath the summary.
I've done that -- but all that I find --
from the            "living color ahead, please."          down --

You may need to re-load the whole page. Sometimes the comments can't load too much l8r after the main video page has been served.

I love the hot take that the decimal system has caused so much suffering throughout the history of human civilization. Who knew?
Thank you Pip.   The re-loading yield the same-same.
PipStuart  8 seconds ago
I obviously didn't intend to make a full-force case against Decimal-Numbers during my talk, which focused more on BlackJack 2021 colors (rather indirectly demonstr8ing the utility in treating mnemonic letters as design8ions of arcane numeric codes, which contextually can serve as better than Decimals, whether old standards or new re-maps). Who knew Decimal caused historic suffering though? Probably the "God(s)" and religious tribal leaders who foisted on us the mind-numbing counting from just 1 (One) up-to Ten-fingers... I expect they knew. Purposeful sabotage is my strong suspicion. Tallies (4 bars and 5th slash), Gematria (Jewish), Roman-Numerals, Arabic digits, etc. were each reinforcing repulsive ritualized retard8ion. Decimal is a disasterous, deleterious, and devast8ing convention of numeric illiteracy... a "Red-Flag" that likely must remain unique to our misguided, oblivious, and illogical species. Decimal in human hands has harmed the whole rest of our bio-spheroid (i.e., planet) as well, for tragically far too long. While I admit that it's currently challenging to compare Tens against altern8ives in ways that provide vivid examples of harms done so far, I still feel rel8ively confident and do aim to deprec8 Decimal-Not8ion, nearly as soon as could even become possible (with less worry about plausible). Almost nobody questions it at all, or is even willing to... which I think confers some culpability (if not abject direct guilt) when assessing the lasting damage done by gener8ions of "math-students" who can't quantify even trivial amounts efficiently or coherently... thinking just Ten-by-Ten-by-Ten-by... just Hundred here, Thousand there, Million, Billion, etc. and "We now think we're cooking with *Fire*!"
Dumb as rocks, us destructive and deadly humans. It would be almost always better if we practiced counting from 0 (Zero) through 255 on our 8 main fingers (leaving thumbs for overflow flags and progress status bits for more complic8d comput8ional oper8ions). I know Decimal is entrenched, but I'm on something of a "Crusade" to crush it and pave part of the way to superior numeral intelligence becoming widespread among the living eventually (even if stubborn stupid "Sapiens" must arrive last to the "party"). Do you deny that Decimal can be damaging? How often do you find quantities of Ten or Hundred within n8ure, reality, every-Day (i.e., non-artificial, non-man-made) sorts of situ8ions, successive cellular-divisions becoming complex living organisms, foliage-branching, weather-events, etc.? Tens scarcely occur, for good reasons! They're grossly inferior to binary-based usage of digits (aggreg8d into Octal, HexaDecimal, Base-64, and so-on). You can dismiss me as just dropping a "hot-take", but I'm quite serious about Decimal and Ten being almost completely terrible and troubling. Thank you for your comment, @kcaran . I'll be glad to get into any of this further, if you (or anyone else) could possibly care to reflect on and defend your unconcerned stance somehow. Have a gr8 Day! GGPeaceOut. -Pip
Thank you Pip.
     Am now reading what you just sent.
     BBSh.
You're welcome. The original comment on YouTube had some paragraph spacing that HangOuts here didn't preserve, but you should still be able to follow it.
Ok.
Back
Cool.
I readd what kcaran said -- and your reply to him (her).
My comments ?
Please.
I think what you said to kcaran was well thought out --
Thanks.
and well conveyed.   Did you think it was not ?
I thought it out carefully and felt I conveyed it mostly competently.
Good.   And Wolf agreed ?
He did.
Good.
Then we 3 agree.
üòä
Cool. Any comments on the content?
Do you plan to suggest a reasonable way that
we might replace the decimal system in the future ?
I do. Yes. Probably a lot must go into any such plan. I've begun thinking about it sometimes pretty intensely. Do you have any ideas about (or for) my planning?
To call this a "monumental" task -- is (without question)
a gross understatement.
Do you know of any country in the world --
which is (now) using a system other than decimal ?
I do not know of one yet... but Wolf just suggested maybe some Chinese or Russians may use some altern8ive. I'll certainly need to research any such discoverable examples, if they're out there.
I believe that would be your real starting place.
Yeah. Good advice.
Find those who are "already on your side".
There probably is nobody adequ8ly on my side yet, or as much as will possibly be needed.
I would (then) say that you would do better
to launch into a far less frustrating cause
-- than one that looks so bleak.
         Yes ?
It might be necessary to transition away from Decimal with some urgency, if delay compounds avoidable harms. Could be crucial, even if a frustr8ing cause with perhaps increasingly bleak prospects. I may have to try to save us and other life anyway, despite whatever difficulties and opposition I must be met with.
Reasonable comments.
You'll make the right decision Pip.
üòä
I hope so. Thanks for your encouragement and consider8ion, Dad. I appreC8 it gr8ly.  ‚ù§
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're welcome.
I ‚ù§
you too.
 Makes happy me.
Thank you.
Since we be in a lull now --
would you like The Weather Report ?
Yes, please.
Ok then.
It follows.

----- The Weather Report -----

This Summer officially started
     last Sunday, June 20 2021
         2332 (me) 2232 (you).

H'ever.  I must say, that this
month (so far) has been more
April-ish, than June-ish.
Wolf: "I wish it was January!"
Wolf: "I guess a lot of humans are."

I'm not complaining -- just
observing.  Actually, the
somewhat coolishness is
on the nice side -- but
the really appreciated
feature is the (continued)
low humidity.

That is what I (so very)
like about the California
summers -- the fact that
the humidity doesn't go
(completely) velcro, when
the temperature soars.

Same.

Of the 43 residences I've
had (in the past 78 years)
3 were in the California
desert.
Nice.

4 months in Death Valley
-- at Fort Irwin, from
June to October of 1966
-- when stationed there,
while in the Army.

And, another 5 months,
with you (and company)
-- at 2 different houses
in Bakersfield -- from
March to August of 1981.


Low humidity makes high
heat quite bearable.
Wolf: "Yes, it does."

It's very "teflon" in its
nature.  But high humidity
(like we get in Pennsylvania)
is awfully uncomfortably
sticky.  That's why I call
it "velcro".

Everything sticks to
everything else!

Wolf: "Yeah, when I was in Tennessee with Barbie's family... oh Tennessee was terrible!"

(//)
Cool. Is there anything else on your PCA for tonight?
Yep.   Tennessee -- and nearly ever other state east of the Rockies too.
Nothing hot.
How about on your PCA ?
I guess maybe I'd like you to describe whether and how you might agree or have contention with the notion that I might be better-understood as a Samurai-Dragon in human-form?
Speak on pleasel
Are there many Dragons or Samurai in our ancestry?
I'm not aware of any.
Wondering.
How might you find out more ?
Wolf seems almost entirely confident that I possess a Dark-Blue Dragon-Spirit of some kind. A highly intelligent one. Pretty curious.
What makes you think that Wolf may be correct ?
I guess exploring the possibility and attempting to be open to any potentially unexpected likelihoods.
Well there are many coincidences I've begun noticing.
GOP
Our SurName without the 'R' is an anagram of "Tatsu" which is a Dragon in Nipponese, along with "Ryu". I notice more Dragons surrounding myriad aspects of my life and affilE8ions. They're becoming more conspicuous, and sometimes maybe uncanny.
Wolf agrees with it too.
And how might you use this knowledge to your and/or others' benefit ?
Not yet sure about that either. I might become capable of hurling fire-balls at some point, probably instead of "breathing-fire" in some perhaps more traditional way, according to lore.
GOP
If I could project fire-balls at-will, I might do a gr8 deal more harm that good with such power. I would probably try not to, but could likely get pretty easily carried away with how fun some abuse might be.  üòâ
Well -- getting carried away might be somewhat exciting -- but I (generally) --
prefer to carry myself to the avenues where I retain most of the control.
Probably prudent. Yeah.
lol
Thank you.
I do have many dozens of Years of practice throwing many versions of fire-balls in the fictional fantasy realms of so many video-games. I could probably learn to continue to do it pretty precisely and discreetly.
Hmm.
Do you consider "discreetness" to be one of your polished traits ?
Often, yes.
Good.
                Do I ?
Wolf: "If I could have power of some kind, I'd probably want to be able to control people's emotions."
Yes, do you?
I can imagine you could have good reasons to go either way.
Sorry.   I'm not sure I made that question clear.
That's okay. I responded to what I thought you meant.
When I said "Do I ?"
I did not mean to ask:  "Is discreetness (also) one of my polished traits ?"
I thought you were asking whether you agreed that it could be a polished tr8 of mine.
I meant to ask if you thought that I (also) believed that discreetness was one of *your* polished traits.
Figured.
Oh.   Ok.   So you *did* "get it".
Thank you.
Is it quiz time ?
Sure.
Good.
Question is for either Wolf or Pip.
Wolf && Pip: "Shoot!"
What happens next Friday, July 2nd, 2021 -- at high noon ?
A shoot-out in front of the Olde Saloon?  üòâ
Wolf: "The O.K.Corral?"
There will be another eclipse?
All good guesses.
But here is the official answer:
Are you like some diplomat now or something?  üòâ
Ah. Yeah. Cool.
Half of this year will be gone.
Will it be cool ?
     I'm knot shoor yet.
üòä
Wolf wants to ask if you know how high corn should be by the 4th of July (I guess if you're like farming or husking or whatever)?
Hmm.
           Gimme a moment to mull please   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...
Ok.
I think I've got it.
W: "Good."
I believe corn should be ‚Äúas high as an
elephant's eye‚Äù by the Fourth of July.
Wolf: "Nope. Knee-high by the 4th-of-July."
Ok.   If you say so.
A Wonderful Guy (from "South Pacific") - Jane Morgan
A Wonderful Guy (from "South Pacific") - Jane Morgan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_dXjL15ZI8
Wolf: "Is that Doris Day?"
We're listening to the song now.
Jane Morgan.
Ah. Thanks.
Whoops.   Wrong song.
Try this one:
'Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin‚Äô' | Gordon MacRae | Rodgers & Hammerstein's OKLAHOMA! (1955 FIlm)
'Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin‚Äô' | Gordon MacRae | Rodgers & Hammerstein's OKLAHOMA! (1955 FIlm)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5APc0z49wg
I think maybe we can start wrapping things up for tonight. I might want to drive Wolf home somewhat soon. Does that sound fine?
The "elephant's eye" comes at 0:48 into that second song.
Ah. Gotcha.
Yes.   Your proposal sounds Xcellent.
Thank you (both) for this nice chat.
Shall we please plan to chat again next FriDay evening around our usual time?
My ‚ù§
 to the two of you.
Friday, July 2, 2021 looks goood too me.
üòä
You're welcome. Thank you very much. I ‚ù§
you too, Dad. I also heartily enjoyed our chat tonight.  üòä
Wolf: "Have a good night, with all my love!"
Good.

Y'all have a good night too -- and an Xcellent week.

Hi Dad. Sorry I was busy last night with a lot on my mind and couldn't get online in time for us to chat. Oni was powered down and I was deep into some important thinking.
Similar, but less so, I have had more thinking to do today and tonight, with Oni just booting up again a few minutes ago. Maybe we can try to chat again tomorrow (SunDay) eve (1900 Ptime / 2000 Gtime), or can just w8 until we can connect another night soon?  ‚ù§

          (of this year -- that is)

And how are you this fine Saturday evening ?

I'm doing gr8 tonight Dad. Thanks for asking. How are you?

Good FriDay EveNing Dad. How are you toNight?
5'07-09-21 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
I be Xcellent.
                     How be you ?
BBSh
I am in quite good shape at the moment. I could say I feel excellent too. Thanks. Take your time.
Thank you.               I did take my time.
And breathed too.
I am glad you are in good shape.
Tell me more about that ?
Good. Nice. Taking breaks and breaths are important to attend to.
And why you feel Xcellent too.
Well it's starting to look like Beppu-san may be about ready to start strategizing for autom8ing crypto-currency (i.e., mainly BitCoin) trading, and if I learn enough of what I'd need to know to become competent at doing so, I could prove quite useful to him in developing strategies that might eventually out-perform his own.
He's been working pretty solitarily on his code for about 10 Years now. Longer than I've considered myself focused on Octology as it exists toDay.
Do you think you would like to do that ?
(outperform him)
It's exciting that he's starting to invite me to try to learn so much and potentially become of use to him, perhaps helping us both earn some consistent money.
O
whoops
I'm glad for the both of you.
I would like to develop better strategies than he has (or others have). Yes. I have very much to learn before I'm at all likely to become capable of doing so though, and even then, it's probably going to be quite hard to come up with successful routines.
Yep. That's pretty exciting. I might try to re-write a lot of his JavaScript code in Perl as a new sub-part of Octology. Maybe not though. We'll see.
Hard stuff is good for you Pip.
     You were born equipped for such.
Indeed, hard stuff can often be good for me. Thank you.
You're welcome.
But not my fault.
You have made (and are continuing to make) you.
Good job Pip.
üòä
I can't always rise-to-the-occasion and succeed at doing hard stuff, solving hard problems yet, etc. but it often seems to have been worthwhile to at least try and maintain perhaps overly-healthy ambition.
Great comment (observ8ion).
üòä
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're a goodie !!
I ‚ù§
you too Dad. You're mostly a goodie too!
only "mostly"
I'm insulted.
I'm not exactly sure what a "goodie" must be, so I hedged a bit. Sorry.
Excuse me while I go cry a little.
üòä
There, there.
I didn't mean offense... much.  üòâ
Thank you for the hugg.
     I feel better now.
üòä
You're welcome.
Maybe I'll get to know you better, and what a goodie is, and is not... and then may revise my declR8ion to design8 you as clearly an unqualified goodie too.
My dictionary has 2 prime definitions for "goodie".
The first one is "a good person"
                            "or place, or thing".
I think I just have one PCA item somewhat prepared for toNight, and it happens to be quite rel8d to this very word: "goodie". How wonderful!
Yes.    Piece of Light 5b.
I'm ready for your PCA.
Ship it when you are please.
Okay. What do you think of the idea that the word "good" is so important that it becomes a problem to have such commonplace antonyms that connote different things, even if aligned significantly?
Like, is "good" opposite of "bad", more than opposite of "evil", more than opposite of "ill", etc.?
Does the overlap between many opposites somehow artificially and detrimentally infl8 the estim8s made about how "positive" a particular "good" is?
If you follow me with all this, might you agree that it could be better to break apart "good" to be "bood" versus "bad" ... and also "gEd" versus "Evil"?
New spellings, pronunC8ions, mnemonic ways to assoC8 with antonyms, ... maybe could be (or become) better than just keeping the "good" that we know (and probably rather "love")?
All 5 of your questions are interesting ponderables.
Gr8!
I'm not sure that I have any direct answers to any of them at the moment.
          But  ...
A couple of comments maybe.
     Permiso to ship ?
Neologisms are usually frowned upon pretty sternly, but I figured you and I could at least consider whether these ones I've come up with and begun attempting to use might be worthwhile.
Permission granted. Ship at will.
Thank you Pip.
     Loading boat now.
As I have discussed with you before (and as you also have a copy of James Allen's sentiments, along the same lines) -- what we think about -- expands.
I'm looking up the James Allen quote. Thoughts expand. Hmm. They probably do.
And -- in concert with that idea -- I do not believe in "evil" -- and --
I rarely (if ever) use the word "bad".
Whenever I find myself kindled to make a comment on something --which I do not really regard as "quite good" -- I usually say something like:  "Well.  That could stand some improvement, I think."
Ah. Okay. Yeah. Makes sense for you. I'm quite different.
Yes.
To both of your comments.
I guess this is also rel8d to a similar issue that arose for me toDay. If you believe in "angels" and/or "demons", can the former be "not quite good", or the latter be "good" as far as you're concerned?
Good question Pip.
Brief answer follows.
Well -- of course -- along the same lines as a couple of my previous comments here -- I do not believe in demons -- -- -- another word that I possibly have never said in the past 78 years.
The question that follows is:  Well Dad -- do you believe in angels ?
Brief answer follows.
I do not give the idea of "angels" the degree of "thingness" that most people tend to.
Instead -- I simply affirm that many different people, places, things, and experiences -- can influence our thinkings and (sometimes also) doings.   And --
these "influencers" are (technically) "angels" -- as --
the primary definition of an "angel" is:   a "messenger".
(//)
Hmm. Okay. Thank you for those answers. Please grant me a few minutes to ponder them, and their significance in my divergent mind.  Be-Back-in-a-Bit...
Ponder away young man.       You have much to give to this broken planet.
Well do you consider your Bible to describe some individu8d beings as more than merely a source of a message, but actual entities which may become "fallen" and this is typically thought to correspond with being holy or gEd initially, but becoming corrupted or heretical when turned from white sky to hot red hell where the "Evil" ones have lost their wings (and perhaps ethical compass)?
Hmm.   Lots in there.
But -- a good question.
Thank you Pip.
URwLcome.  üòä
üòä
I (suspect) the following -- will not be --
a brief answer.
Brevity is for the birds!  üòâ
lol
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
No offense, to you just using brief answers those minutes ago. Fine to be brief when you want. I ‚ù§
you too.
üòä
Thank you Pip.
There are (at least) a-half-a-dozen words in that last question of yours -- that I'd like to key-in on -- and address.
I think I shall start with the "Bible".
Okay. Please do key-in on my words, however you'd like.
Thank you.
Then so I shall.
The Bible.
We are taught that the whole Bible -- all (about) 792,000 words of it -- are "inspired" by God.
And -- that teaching is based on The Bible itself -- which (in II TIm 3:16) -- says that.
The Greek word, which is commonly translated into English as "inspired" -- actually means "breathed".So "inspired" is (really) a pretty-good translation.
However --
The word "breathed" might have been even better -- because --
the word "inspired" fails to paint-a-picture for the reader --
like the word "breathed" would.
I'll explain.
Most people will paraphrase II Tim 3:16 -- by saying:
"God *wrote* the whole Bible."
And (technically) that is true.
But --
Those "most" people are holding an inaccurate picture of this "writing" process.
And thereby -- missing a gigantic teaching.
They (those "mostly" people) see God (The Father) writing The Scriptures".
And -- this is a (totally) inaccurate picture of how The Bible (really) got writ.
The Father only (personally) wrote a tiny (tiny!) portion of The Bible.
And that was on Mount Sinai -- in the presence of Moses.
The Father's finger as pen.
The "stone tablets" as paper.
All the rest of The Bible was not written by The Father.
It (all the rest)  was written by The Son.
Yes.  There is more to this.
But I wanted to pause here -- in case "stuff" is coming up for you.
Okay. Thanks.
I should go on.               Or -- you wish to insert something ?
Stuff is coming up for me, but I'm trying to just follow what you're putting forth without interjecting too much of my own thoughts about any of it yet. Yes, please carry on, when you're ready to.
Thank you.
I shall.
So.   The next question probably is:
     How many "pen-holders" wrote The Bible ?
Well -- to the best of our research -- looks like about 9 for the New Testament.
And another 30 or so -- for the Old Testament.
However.
The important point here -- is -- that (ordinary) *people* wrote The Bible.
Did God (The Father) -- dictate every word to each one of the pen-holders ?
And the answer is:  No.
But -- He did approve everything that was said.
And by "approve" -- I mean -- He said to Himself:
     "Yes.   That line will be good (and helpful) for the readers to get to know Me."
Now.   Take a breath here.
And I'll go on.
*breath*
üòä
Should we use everything we find in The Bible as an example of thinkings and/or doings -- which we should emulate ?
Absolutely not.
!!
There are many things in The Bible -- which are (glaring) examples of things that we should not do.
And -- sorting through The Bible -- and deciding which parts are good examples -- and which parts are not-so-good examples -- is one of the really tough things about The Bible.
And the very tail-end of II Tim 2:15 -- briefly impresses upon us -- the hefty importance of that "sorting" process.
The tail-end of II Tim 2:15 says:
       "rightly dividing the word of truth."
"the word of truth"  means "The Bible".
And -- "rightly dividing" is precisely about what I said above.
     Which are the stuff to follow.
     Which are the stuff to steer clear of.
Another pause here Pip.
     I go on.       Or you take a turn ?
Hmm. Please go on, when you'd like. I'm trying to think about each point you're making.
Good.
Thank you.
I shall continue.
The BIG trouble with the reading (studying) (thinking about the things which are said, or related to us in) The Bible -- is -- that many (many, many!) people are not very good at "correctly parsing" (rightly dividing) The Scriptures.
And not everything which a writer (of The Bible) attributes to The Father -- was actually done by The Father.
Sorry to interrupt, but could you please just take a moment to provide me with one or two examples of where the writer of the Bible attributes to the Father something that was not actually done by Him?
However.   The writer of that portion -- believed that The Father was saying thus-and-such -- or suggesting such-and-such to be done -- when that was (often) not the case.
Could God, The Father, have prevented that section from ending up (being included) in The Scriptures ?
Yes.
But He chose not to.
Why ?
I answered that before -- but I shall dig a bit deeper into it for us here.
And -- thank you for that question.
I shall come back to that shortly.
Now.
Why did God (The Father) not "edit out" some of the things said about Him -- which were not actually "of Him" -- or from Him ?
And now -- we return to II Tim 3:16.
I'd better type out the whole verse here -- so we can easily see all of it.

II Tim 3:16

II Tim 3:16

All scripture is given by inspiration of God,
and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

This verse says that:  all scripture is profitable.
But then -- it goes on to tell us of the 4 departments of that profitability.

 (1)  for doctrine
 (2)  for reproof
 (3)  for correction
 (4)  for instruction in righteousness

Now.
Amongst these 4 lines --
there are (at least) 3 words --
which are not highly familiar to most of us.
So.   Let's make this a little easier.

These are the 4 things that The Bible is good for.

It teaches us:

 (1)  what is right
 (2)  what isn't right
 (3)  how to get right
 (4)  how to stay right
And -- some pretty sizable portions of (especially the Old Testament) of The Bible -- fall into the "reproof" category.
That is #2.
        What isn't right.
And many people think that "God is a particular way" -- when the truth is that the writer of that section *thought* that God was saying something -- that was merely an incorrect thought (or assumption) of the writer.
Sorry to interrupt again, but with #2, do you specifically mean what *is* "wrong" rather than merely "what isn't right" (since that could easily be including neutral ambiguous middle-territory)?
And God allowed that to be included -- so that we would take that passage (and many other passages like that one) -- back to God -- and ask Him about it.
God, did you actually say that ?
But most people don't bother doing that.
Or worse -- very few people believe that God actually holds a conversation with His children.
Good Question Pip.
The words "what isn't right" -- is meant to (really) mean:
          what    is    not    profitable    for    you.
Ok  Pip ?
I guess okay for now. I'm struggling with lots of this, but trying to hang in.
Good for you Pip.
Everyone struggles with this.
The bigger sadness is that --
the vast majority of those "strugglers" --
either  ‚Ä¢  quit struggling, or  ‚Ä¢  give up the struggle with a very errant conclusion.
---------------------------------------
And I think here is a good place to address --
that questions of yours --
that I said we would come back to.
     Yes ?
Yes.
Good.
You asked:
Could you please just take a moment to provide
me with one or two examples of where the writer
of the Bible attributes to the Father something
that was not actually done by Him?

Ok.
Question for you:
Can you recall an incident when God (supposedly) told
the Israelites to "wipe out" the people of some other nation ?
Yes.
Do you want to pick one please ?
I think the "Amalekites" were ones somewhere? I forget the specifics right now. You can pick any suitable example n8ion, if I'm mistaken with my guess here.
That's fine.
We'll go with that one.
Now.
A few questions.
Can God be un-Godlike ?
Answer is:   No.
Depends on definitions.
Can Pip be un-Pip-like ?
Can a man be un-man-like?
Answer is:   No.
Yes, Pip can be un-Pip-like.
"You're not your usual sarcastic, dead-pan, cynical-bastard self toDay. What's up?"
No.   When you do something -- you are showing us that that doing is a part of you.
Okay. Out-of-character stuff can fit these words though.
We may never have seen it before -- but now we have learned that that *is* a part of you.
I think you're over-simplifying things, but perhaps it is useful to making a larger point.
It depends who decides who or what is, or isn't, "like" whatever.
The 10 Commandments were (yes) a bunch of 10 suggestions -- that God wanted Mo to share with the Israelites.
But they were something else too.
They were a list of the primary characteristics of God.
And -- that List was further saying -- if you are my children (and you are) -- then -- I am (here) suggesting that you imitate my primary characteristics.
#5 is:  Thou shalt not kill.
How did they see that suggestion ?
Animals ?   Plants ?
No.    Your brothers and sisters.
Just through Abraham ?
No.
Narrowly, as applicable only to your tribe or people, but not pertaining to others, foreigners, animals, plants, etc..
All people.
Don't kill any of my children.
Of any tribe, nation, or ancestor.
Well how did Israelites see killing before, or after, the Commandment was produced? Differs somewhat. Unclear what you were asking.
The point I'm heading for here is:
When a writer of Scripture says that God said to wipe out this nation, or that nation, or this group of people, or that group of people -- my mind says -- well -- he may have believed that that was God -- but -- what I know about God -- says -- that that came from within that man's own (unconnected to the Father) mind.
This is also occurring within the very "Scripture" that your God, the Father, approved would enable people to know Him?
How can you know what Scripture can be discarded because what you know of God is more authorit8ive somehow?
Yep.   Very assuredly -- it is happening right there.
We chat.
God and I.
He teaches me things.
How could you know it's Him that you chat with?
Many things I don't understand.
I ask Him questions.
He teaches me further.
I don't know Him yet.
But -- I know Him better today -- than I did yester.
I'm skeptical. Highly.
How could you know it's Him that you chat with?
He tells me things that could not have come from anywhere else.
I'm glad Pip.
How can that be known?
You should be skeptical.
What is one thing He told you that I couldn't have told you first instead?
And -- you can tell Him that too.
Yep.
I see that question.
And I've got a better one for you.
Ask Him -- to tell you something that He has never told anyone else.
I don't know Him. Maybe He doesn't know me. I can't ask someone with effectively no recognizable body to listen to me, or respond somehow. You believe you already have His audience. Please ask on my behalf, since I seem to be ill-equipped to do so.
Oh my dear Philip.
How I *so* love you.
Lots of stuff in there.
I'll skip over a few of them (for now).
But I shall share on a few others.
You said:
Please ask on my behalf, since I seem to be ill-equipped to do so.
Many earthly fathers, or mothers, or other friends, or relatives -- are worried -- that someone that they love -- will never come to know God.
I'm not one of those.
I am not worried.
God and I have discussed you.
You *do* come to know Him.
He has not told me when.
But this is not of any importance.
You will come.
But not when I would like it to happen.
Not when anyone here on earth would like it to happen.
But then --                     when the most important, and powerful person --
wants it to happen.
And not one second before.
And with that knowledge -- I am (totally, and completely) at:
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks Dad. I think if I do come to "know" God at all well, eventually, it could likely be for the primary purpose of killing that thing proclaimed far and wide to be perfect, "good" by-definition, omniscient, omnipotent, omnitemporal, omnispacial, etc. but seems to have been (and be) none of those. If a God installed Ten-Commandments and numbers as one through ten, I think it is probably a terrible adversary of life and our planet. It should not be listened to, trusted, or allowed to live longer than it must. I'm glad you're at peace with others not believing in your "God". Not worrying about it could be better than stressing over something which you may have little control over. I ‚ù§
you too, Dad.
You're welcome Pip.
And thank you.
Oh.
I just noticed.
You're welcome. Shall we wrap chat up for the Night and plan to re-convene next FriDay on July 16th?
I had made a reference to:
     "the most important, and powerful person"
I'm not sure it you knew to whom I was referring.
               Of course -- that is You.
What ?
But -- I have a list of my own PCAs.
Are you tired ?
Thanks for clarifying. I thought you were meaning Jesus or Angie or someone other than me, and I didn't inquire to find out.
Ah, okay. Your PCAs also.
You are the most important and powerful person in the world.
Please let's address one or more of yours too. I'm not quite tired, but feel a growing need to get doing other things soon too.
Just because you are not fully aware of that yet -- does not mean that it is not true.
Ok.
Thank you.
I have only 3 PCAs -- which I am currently listing as "hot".
Let's do the 2 short ones.
And then we'll see how you feel at that point.
Ok ?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
PCA #1
This one is:   An Xcellent Josh Report.

As a result of the very painful
communique from my Father -- 2¬Ω
weeks ago -- I am happy to report
that I have been Eating As Josh
-- for the past 15 days straight.

And additionally -- I have been
quite measurably more diligent
in attending to the much higher
priority things on my agenda
list too.

For far too many weeks -- my
life was merely treading water.

Is this how I truly want to
spend the not too numerous
years that I have left --
to make a real difference
on this planet ?

I think not!


(//)
Nice. Glad to hear you're more dedic8d to living as you'd more prefer yourself to. Hopefully lenience where warranted can keep you out of being your own slave-driver though too. Balance can be tough.
Thank you Pip.
Ready for PCA #2 ?
You're welcome. Yes, #2?
Good.
Thank you.
Here comes.

Crew turns 8 tomorrow.

In my birthday card to him
-- I mentioned that my 8th
birthday was the very best
that I can ever remember.

I did not (also) tell him
that 8 is his Uncle's
favorite number.
Cool. I hope he and his close family have a gr8 time together. 8 is an important number throughout my life. It's your BirthDay's Month and Day every Year so far. My Octology is based heavily on 8 first, and 64 (8-squared) secondarily. Yep. Happy 8th BirthDay Crew, from your estranged outcast Uncle (who would probably like to meet you someDay, if we could under pleasant circumstances).
Good Pip.
And along those lines -- I'd like to say something else.
Here goes.

I know that I have encouraged
you to (at least) remember --
this person, or that person --
with at least a birthday card
-- such as Mom, or Angie, or
whomever.

And you have shared with me
that you have good reasons
to not wish to have any
contact with this person,
or that person.

And I understand that.

But Crew and you have no
reason not to be connected.
I think Tim and Amanda are reasons why Crew and I should not be connected.

Just because there may be
something that has you and
his parents not in contact
with each other -- should
not (also) deprive him from
communication with his Uncle.
If Tim doesn't want to stay in-touch with me even like once-per-Year, well then it seems pretty certain that he doesn't know me well enough or want me to have anything to do with his kids lives either.

Uncles are important people
in the lives of youngsters.
Hmm. Maybe you're correct... sorta, but reaching Crew would have to go through his parents and I probably need to get along better with them before attempting to reach out for connection with their kids.

And so much so for Crew --
as you are the next closest
apt male-role-model for him.

And there will be coming
times when he will want
that connection with you.
I'm probably not a good "male-role-model" for any child, even if I'm next closest somehow.

I think I've said enough
on this for now.  I'll
give it a rest.
Perhaps. Yeah, maybe. I will try to think about it more.

(//)
Thanks for saying what you think. I appreC8 your perspective.
You're welcome Pip.
Thank you for receiving it so graciously.
‚ù§
Those were my 2 biggies.
The other one is kinda long.
Do you want we should push it to another night --
         or are you up for it now ?
Another night would probably be best, if it can w8?
Absolutely.
I share declassify it to only "warm".
Thank you for a very nice chat this evening Pip.
I appreciate it.
üòä
I ‚ù§
 you so  very  very  very much.
You're welcome. Thank you too for our chat this evening Dad. I am gr8ful for our times together. I ‚ù§
you too.  üòä
You want we shoot for next Friday ?
Let's, please!
Thank you --  Thank you -- and Thank you -- and --
you're welcome Pip.
Ok.
Friday, July 16, 2021 - 2000 Mine / 1900 Yours.

Yep, looks bood.  üòâ

Good FriDay EveNing Dad.
I just took my medic8ion and wanted to let you know a little early that I am heading out right now to go pick up Wolf and get us some coffee before we plan to be returning here to my apartment so that we can both hopefully chat with you together toNight.
We might not be back until a while after 7PM (-0500), but will hopefully be able to connect with you sometime toNight, even if we can't coordin8 our availability until sometime further into the EveNing than originally planned.
I ‚ù§
you, Dad. Be back probably rel8ively shortly.  üòä

Hi Dad. How are you toNight?
5'07-16-21 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime

Shabbat Shalom Philip.
Shabbat Shalom Dad.
I yam goood.
How you am ?
üòä
Eyamm Gooway 2woo.  üòâ
Wolf: "Me do fine. hehe"
Hello Wolf.
Glad to hear that.
     And -- glad to see you.
Wolf: "Hello back."
üòä
üòä
You got a PCA for tonight Wolf ?
Well we're kinda just catching each other up on our respective Day here.
I see.
Wolf: "Not really. I'll just talk about whatever you want to talk about."
Basically same for me, for now.
Ok.
Do you have any PCA items toNight Dad?
So how was your respective days ?
I do.
They can w8.
How was your respective days ?
It seems that Wolf had a really rough Night and Day. Mine seemed to go predominantly better than his, but hopefully both of us are in good shape to have a better EveNing and Night now.
Ok.
Wolf: "When I have a bad Night, I usually go into my living-room and lift w8s."
Thank you.
And that helps Wolf ?
Wolf: "Yes, quite a bit. Keeps me in shape, and it wears me down so I can sleep."
Yep.
Good idea.
Wolf: "Yep."
What was the source of your "bad day" -- if I may ask ?
Wolf: "Just... hot and I was uncomfortable laying down."
I see.
Wolf: "I have problems sleeping when it's hot."
Wolf: "I woke up several times from NightMares also."
Yes.   It was above 20¬∞ here today too.
Hmm.
I've been having only nice dreams lately.
     Glad for that.
Glad to read that. Yeah.
Wolf: "Good to hear that. I usually have good dreams too... just last Night it was off-the-wall."
Yep.   Those come sometimes.
Wolf: "My favorite dreams are me being deep in the woods, in the forest, running..."
üòä
I did a "study" (sort of) of my dreams for about a year -- a couple of years ago.
What did your study find?
Wolf: "That's interesting."
I wrote down every dream that I had for slightly over 12 months.
And I usually had (at least) one every night.
And often more than one.
Wolf: "You should write a movie, like Stephen King. He gets his movies from dreams."
My conclusion was:
     I really didn't know any more about dreams after I was finished with my
     study -- than when I began.
üòä
But -- a few of them were somewhat insightful.
Wolf: "What do you mean by 'insightful'? I am curious."
Movie ?
Hmm.
Good question Wolf.
During my study -- I always tried to look for some kind of meaning in each dream.
But -- in the 400 (or so) that I had over the course of my project --
Wolf: "In a lot of my NightMares, I've been stuck in mazes with no way to get out and struggling to move around. They shuffle around."
only a few dozen (or so) seemed to have any coherent message.
Yes.  Those "mazes" dreams are pretty standard for nightmares.
And -- they do have a message.
Wolf: "... or the other dreams I have: I go up against a wall and they don't have an edge and there's no bottom."
They usually are about something in our real life -- in which we are failing to make a decision on.
What's the message you think there is in maze-like dreams Dad?
Ah. Hmm. Could be, yeah.
Thanks.
However -- rarely do they (those dreams) give us any clear hint as to what the area of our indecision is.
Bummer.
Wolf: "Hmm. Very interesting."
Ok.
I don't recall ever having a dream that I considered to be all that "maze"-like. Maybe I have had some that I just can't remember well, or at the moment. Hmm.
I see your "up against a wall" comment Wolf.
Wolf: "Umm. The walls are kind of like a water-fall."
Those are an indication that we are tending to refuse coming up with a "Plan B" in some area of our life -- which has to do with some sort of desire of ours.
Wolf: "That could be the truth... but mine are much deeper."
If the "wall" is non-solid (like a waterfall) -- next time you have one of those -- try walking through it -- if that is a possibility.
You said "deeper".   How so Wolf ?
Wolf: "The walls in my dreams are impenetrable. The water-fall is not water. It's a wall that moves."
Ah so.
You have had these a number of times -- yes ?
Wolf: "Exactly."
I get it.
Wolf: "The only way to get out of that dream is to wake up."
Recurrent dreams are pretty important.
Wolf: "It's kinda like being in charge of everything, and having no authority."
Next time you have one of those -- as soon as you wake up -- write out the details of the dream.   And then --
Wolf: "But I don't remember them right away."
after you have done all of that -- keep writing -- but ask your "dream paper" questions that you have about the dream.
You will usually get (some) answers that way.
Maybe you're forgetting Dad, that Wolf barely knows how to rEad or write yet. He's learning quite rapidly for a 62-Year-Old, but he's not trained in English composition from early age. Don't be a complete asshole to my friend, please?!
The "no authority" thing is pretty universal Wolf.   And that is a real-life thing.
Wolf: "If I could write my 'real-life' thing, I would have a Billion-Dollar movie! Mmm-hmm."
The dream is a clear message that we find ways in our real life -- to (successfully) deal with these frequent situations.
Wolf: "When I was younger, my dreams had a monster in the swamp... and the monster seemed like maybe it was me that was killing everyone."
Go on please.
Wolf: "It seemed like I was there, with the people... and everyone was killed but me... so I thought I was the monster."
I consider dreams to be worse than worthless generally.
Ok.
They're rather bl8antly unconscious hallucin8ions that shouldn't be given hardly any credence, as far as I'm concerned.
Many people feel that way Pip.
And that's fully ok.
I only shared with Wolf about it -- because he brought it up.
Thanks for that affirm8ion. What has compelled you to consider them learning opportunities more than mindless visions?
Good Q Pip.
Answer is:  Piece of Light #29.
But then -- you probably knew that that would be my answer -- yes ?
üòä
Fair enough. Yes, I concede that dreams (especially NightMares or Night-Terrors) can be quite disturbing and gripping. Hideously fright-inducing experiences that can be hard to shake, especially if experiencing malevolence and paralysis, etc..
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks Dad. I keep trying to ‚ù§
in general, and especially toward you too.
And -- Piece #5b too.
Thank you Pip.
Forgotten. We're looking them up now...
          I get it.
Good for you.
Got 'em. Everything a "gift" and supposedly no "accidents" in /your/ "universe". Yeah, right!
They (very) tend to go together.
And have much to do with how your Dad "operates".
There's that. Fair enough.
Do you (Dad) oper8 in broken ways which there is little (if any) hope of recuper8ing or aiding in recovery from?
Hmm.
Wolf: "Haha. I was bad at that game. I always ended up killing everyone."
I think that is a good Q Pip.
But I'm not quite sure that I understand it.
     Help please ?
I can try. What might you understand from it (as phrased)?
Of course you did Wolf.
I could have told you that from what I learned in your dreams !!
üòä
Wolf: "Hahaha. I wished I could have brought them back to life... like a true God."
You *are* a true God.
The is who you are.
Wolf: "Thanks. That means a lot to me."
You're welcome Wolf.
Simply ::: the truth.
Ok Pip.   You said:
I (Pip) am in some ways reasonable to recognize as "super-human"... but I am rather decidedly not like any "god" or "God" who has been described before (that I know of yet). I am mainly a man, and would go to gr8 lengths to distance myself profoundly and conspicuously from any "god".
Wolf: "God was in an orphanage as a child."
Do you (Dad) oper8 in broken ways which there is little (if any) hope of recuper8ing or aiding in recovery from?
There are a number of sections in that question that I need some help on.
We'll take them one-at-a-time -- if that's ok with you.
That's fine.
Good.
Thank you.
First of all:
Wolf: "Well God, no. Animal and Wolf were in the orphanages. I call them 'Gods'. They're both stronger spirits in me."
The "broken ways" thing.
I'm guessing that you believe that I *do* operate in broken ways.
Is that correct ?   Do you believe that ?
I *do* believe that. Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
I *do* believe that every human oper8s in various "broken ways". Some worse than others.
Welcome.
And select one please.   And tell me how that "way" is broken.
Okay. Please give me a couple minutes to think of a hopefully approprE8 one.
TYT.
Thanks. Here goes. So, you habitually rely upon these grossly over-simplified (under-clarified) pieces-of: "Light" (i.e., crap) as though they're universal wisdom from a perfect God, HimSelf. 29 of those, which are not even easily all memorable by you. Then those reference 27 "Axioms" which you try to keep secret until precisely when they're needed (and not shared before). If you're aspiring to become some kind of competent "teacher", you ought to take a page out of the bood educ8or "play-book" and make memorable lessons... which secrecy should be anathema toward.
You're broken in this, because when someone seriously tries to take your messages to "heart", and challenges you on them, you don't even seem to be capable or willing to defend them in the least.
This is disjoint with your "stu"s. You have all the "truth"... all the "wisdom"... in your own mind and self-concept, but almost none seems to transl8 to care for who you think can benefit from your experiences or insights or perspectives on difficult matters in life.
Excellent.
Thank you Philip.
You're welcome.
Sorry I'm maybe being overly harsh, when I perhaps should be "pulling-my-punches" a bit better. I'm not trying to destroy all of what you hold dear. I just don't know how to try to get through to you that wisdom must be defended somehow, if it is to qualify as such.
I see no harshness Pip.
You shared what you believe.
The same thing that you have shared with me a number of times before.
And you have simply said that that which works for me -- what brings me to peace -- and makes me happy -- and moves me forward -- does not do the same for you.
This is another way that you're broken.
I respect that Pip.
You think I've shared this with you a number of times before.
You're wrong.
I've shared similar ideas, very differently from the way I have here.
You are not discerning.
You are not perceptive.
You are broken in ways that inhibit you from recognizing that you can be wrong.
To all 3 of those comments -- I say:
     You are correct Pip.
Yes I am.
Why don't *you* please tell a way that you know you are broken, and then explain *how* that way is broken?
Wolf: "I've been broken since birth... but I've learned to survive through it."
Yes -- you have Wolf.

I fully agree that many of my "ways"
are broken.  This is one of the reasons
that each of us came to this Earth --
and got skinsuits.

As we are here in Heaven-School to
learn (essentially) only 2 things.

There are only 2 Courses in Heaven-School.

And the first Course is: to recognize
each one of our "broken ways" -- and
replace those brokennesses with gooder
ways.

(//)

Wolf: "I have many more Years of being broken... but I've survived. A lot of boundaries to go through."
Yep.
Good Wolf.
Heaven is not a real place. Nobody came to this Earth. Nobody has skin-suits. This is not a school. There are not courses. You don't know how to recognize breaks. "Good" is an Evil word. (So is "gooder"!) Your ways are defunct old ancient antiqu8d anachronistic ways of stupid Evil vengeful imm8ure spiteful unjust unmerciful uncompassion8 unwavering uncompromising unintelligent intolerable deities and brain-washed indoctrin8d mind-less sycophant f8hful followers of a "way" that you call "Truth" and "Light" but corresponds with neither. You call Evil "good", and gEd you call Evil. Similarly you call bad "good", and bood you call bad. You're broken and backwards and imperturbable. You are a broken-record. A looping repeat-One (A.K.A. "Trinity") song that has no place or purpose in the modern era. You are a stodgy crotchety relic of a bygone religious cult.  (//)
Wolf: "My beliefs in Heaven... is it's not a place of internal life, but just a stopping point to your next body. Hopefully mine goes to the body of a wolf, so that I can be who I am."
Pip:   Comments noted     Thank you.
Wolf.   Thank you.   Interesting.
I ‚ù§
 you both.
üòä
Hmm.   Come to think of it -- that is one of Angie's favorite songs.
You're not welcome. I ‚ù§
you less, because you supposedly note things which you can't even comprehend... and scarcely even could be bothered to try to. You're inept. Impotent. Keep dreaming that you're rel8d to your "Father" (the "AllMighty", yeah as if!). Inability to defend "truth" or "wisdom" means you probably possess little (if any), and are more likely possessed yourself, by Evil old spirits puppeteering or marionetting you as if there's some substance to your character somewhere. Exorcise your demons, or suffer the f8 you consider fair for Evil to be aw8ing (perhaps, as justice may occur in something like that fashion). I caution you severely, old man. Turn from your Evil. Don't repent. Don't sacrifice your Son ("Proof", whatever). Don't sacrifice your animals. Don't confess to a priest. Don't pray to some unidentifiable being. Make yourself real somehow. I can't do it for you, and you're probably rapidly running out of time to avoid being the author of your own impending demise and possibly lengthy (maybe even indefinite) torture thereafter. You make your bed. You sew your seeds. You lay and push up your daisies. It might not have to be so bleak, but your stubborn self-assuredness, as though confidence and positivity alone (like claiming perpetual perfection abounding, there never occurring any accidents, etc.) can save you from your own Evil aw8ing you unfortun8ly probably rather soon ahead.

Comments noted.
Thank you Pip.
Could you please share what you have "noted"?
Certainly.
     Isn't it already on your screen ?
Just because you can copy/paste text does not mean you've noted anything. What does *your* notes about what I've written say?
I did not write down any notes for myself yet.
You said quite a bunch.
s/(do)es/$1/;
Learn PCRE.
I need some mull time.
PCRE ?
Bood. I could use more time to my other activities too.
If you and Wolf want to finish discussing anything for a while, I'm fine typing to let you guys hash out whatever you still have.
Wolf: "You first."
Ok.   Thank you Pip.
Not any time.
Oh no Wolf.
You first.
üòä
Wolf: "I don't know... I don't know what to say at the moment. That's why I said 'You first.' so you could bring up the subject. Any questions that I may be able to answer for you?"
Wolf: "Okay. For me, tell me more about your God."
Wow.
That's a pretty big one.
Maybe you'd better ask me some specific questions.
s/(use more time) (to) (my other activities)/$1 for (or $2 do) $3/;
Wolf: "Well for one, your God did *not* crE8 the universe. It's been here for 15-Trillion Years (or more)."
Ok.   So you believe that.
That's ok with me.
Wolf: "Yes, I do. Deeply, because we (as humans) did not *start* on this planet. We were not made to *be* on this planet."
Ok.
And you know this because ?
Wolf: "Because we are the only species on this planet that is born helpless, and our eyes are not truly adapted to our Sun. Our planet was destroyed in a collision."
And you remember being on that other planet ?
Wolf: "No... but through science, they describe we are the only species on this planet who has lower-back problems because the atmosphere is too harsh on us."
Ok.
Wolf: "... and I probably was on the other planet, maybe coming here along with the others."
And -- when you stop breathing -- and the heart in your skinsuit stops beating -- what happens to the true "who" of you ?
Wolf: "I am truly wolf. I want to go back to being a wolf."
Ok.   I'll accept that.   But where will you do that ?
Your home planet was destroyed.
Wolf: "Our home planet. Humans of all species came from there."
I'm confused.
Didn't you tell me that your home planet was destroyed ?
Wolf: "By another planet. A rogue planet."
Wolf: "A confused ear-of-corn?"
So -- then where will you go after you are finished on this earth ?
Wolf: "I want to go to Mars, and beyond."
L7GMLAME
Yes -- corn-fused.
Wolf: "I get the corn picture now. Corn-fused. Haha.  üòä
"
Are there other wolves on Mars ?
Wolf: "No. Not yet. There's military 'Black-Ops' already there."
Ok.
So -- you will be The First Wolf ?
Wolf: "I am a one-of-a-kind wolf."
Wolf: "A lone-wolf."
lol
I always knew that Wolf !!

We're listening now...
Wolf: "Ah. I know this song. I thought this sounded familiar.  *singing-along*  "
üòä
Wolf: "I was about... it was before Janis Joplin when this song came out."
Carole King is one of my heroes.
Wolf: "She has a beautiful voice."
One of the greatest song writers of the 1960s !!
Wolf: "I can almost see where I was staying... with some friends, when this song came out."
Yep.   Good voice too.
You are right Wolf.
Wolf: "Ft. Lauderdale FloRida."
Wolf: "I don't remember what Year it came out though. I know I was a child."
Wolf: "Or a pup. However you want to put it.  üòä

Well thanks for chatting tonight, Dad.
I hope you can hold on to what matters and enjoy a beneficial WeekEnd and Week ahead.
Wolf: "I want to say: 'GoodNight, and have a good Week and WeekEnd. Love ya.'  ‚ù§
"
May we please plan to try chatting again next FriDay Eve (unless something urgent comes up before then)?
"So Far Away", by Carole King, went to #14, in the early October of 1971.
I believe that was the year you became a teenager -- yes ?
Wolf: "I was a teenager. I knew I was a kid."
Wolf: "But I was already hitch-hiking around the country."
She not only sang it -- but she wrote it too..
Thank you too Pip.
And Wolf.
So -- I don't get to do any of my PCAs.
       Sniff, sniff.
Well.
I can w8.
I ‚ù§
 you both.
Yeah, w8ing would probably be best.
Thanks.

Hi Dad. Sorry I was out driving with Wolf last night, and missed our usual chat time.
I will keep trying to check in on Google HangOuts during the evenings, to see if you might show up as recently active. Hopefully we can try again next FriDay eve, if another night doesn't work out ahead any sooner.
6'07-24-21 - 2216 Gtime / 2116 Ptime
Good Morning Philip.
Bood EveNing Dad.
üòä
How was the drive ?
So-so.
Where'd you go ?
Over to get coffee at a restaurant then picked up another friend from a motel to run an errand.
Ah ha.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I would think that time would be better than just "so-so".
You were out with 2 friends.
Doesn't that rate (at least) better than a "C" ?
Hmm. Normally it would probably be a better time, but we spent a long time w8ing in the car and I was pretty tired.
I see.
Yep.  I get that.
Tired from what ?
I was just feeling lethargic and wanted to sleep for much of the w8ing time.
Ok.
Do you find yourself lethargic often ?
Yes. A few Days, probably about every Week or two.
Got a clue on why ?
Yes. It usually corresponds to me running out of stimulants that help keep me up, awake, aware, able to focus, concentr8, prioritize, be productive, etc..
Hmm.
Is it possible that your "required) evening medication sleepy makes you ?
(required)
It's possible, but not obviously the primary culprit, if it contributes to my regular sluggishness at all.
Ok.

Well -- just so you know:

Mom & I did not bring you into this
world -- to have only a "so-so" time!
To be crystal-opaque, I'm *on* this world, not _in_ (or "into") this world.
üòâ
Hmm.
Ok.   I'll engage in this debate with you.
üòä
You are *on* this "earth"/world -- yes.
But -- you are *in* the experience of your time here.
Yes ?
Oooh. Yes.
Doo-dah- doo-dah- doo-dah- doo-dah-Day !!
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I sing good.
üòä
I'm "up-in-the-air" about "love" again. Sorry. Thanks anyway. Do you sing baad or bood too?  üòä
I'm up-in-the-air too.
Nearly always flying.
I have a question -- which I shall (also) answer.
Ready ?
Okay.
Okay.   Thank you.
Why did I say "Good Morning" instead of
"Good Evening" at the front of this chat ?
Because (mentally) I am in Paris.
And -- it is Sunday morning here.
Cool.
As you can see in the photo -- just about an hour before dawn.
Nice.
üòä
üòä
And another question -- permiso ?
Si.
üòä
Thank you.  And this one is for you to answer please.

How is it that you see me immediately
when I put a message into the chat window ?

Not only tonight.  Seems this happens
quite frequently.
My FireFox web-browser is configured to allow some web-pages (like GMail.Com with the HangOuts side-bar) to gain permission to produce an alert notific8ion chime sound. When I hear that, even though I'm usually doing stuff on other virtual-desktops, I know I can probably return to my primary virtual-desktop containing GMail in order to find what you have entered into our chat log sub-window. I think you've asked this before, and I have provided essentially the same answer previously.
Ok.   Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hmm.   You're probably correct.
I believe I did ask you that before.
And my "Google Chrome" browser does not have that feature ?
I don't know. I mainly use FireFox and BraveBrowser (which might be a Chrome fork). Yours probably does have that fE8ure, but I'm not sure how to enable or configure it. Probably conduct web-searches on DuckDuckGo or Google itself to find out.
Ah-ha.       Thank you Pip.
                      (You have a good memory Pip)
You remember what we chatted about 14¬Ω months ago !!
You're welcome. (I think my memory is often pretty bood. I've begun considering this old "good" to be "neutraal" or "baad". Experimenting with these, rather unsteadily.)
Noted.   Thank you.
It basically goes: gEEd, bood, neutraal, neutrool, baad, EvIl  ... with maybe some overlap perhaps, but generally a 6-part spectrum from most positive and honorable and beneficial on the left (first), descending to worst on the right (wrong, rEAd, etc. üòâ
).
IllIIIlllllIIIllllllllIIIIIIIIllllllIIIIIIIllIIIIIIIill  üòä
Too  pli-com-cated 4 me !!
But -- thank you.
Yeah. Almost for me too.
You're welcome.
lol
üòä
Another Q for you -- permiso ?
I think there might be eventual benefits to disambigU8ing the multiple antonyms of old "good" to have their own new forms along with specially paired new opposites.
Hmm.
I'm not sure you've got me convinced yet.
Yes. You don't need to ask permission to ask a question. Overly polite. Just ask. You're already asking.
lol
Do you know what today is ?
L7O -==- SatUrDay, July 24th of 2021 in the Common-Era.
Yep.   True.   But -- I meant in significance to us.
I am not yet remembering what toDay is in significance to us. Please remind me.
Ok.   Wilco.
Emmy turned 10 today.
SSA: Sunday, July 24, 2011
Her Grampa was on a Sunday too.
Nice.
Yes.   'Tis.
          And -- I even found a cake with 10 candles !!
Tim's kids are unfamiliar to me. I figure he must want things this way.
He's unfamiliar to me too, for that matter. Oh well.  üòû
           Just temporary.
This *must* change.
Do you think that Tim & Mandy's kids do
not ask questions about their Uncle Philip ?
You know they do !!
I think they do not ask about me. Correct.
No, I do not know they do.
Children are curious about such things.
I have heard that Finley used to joke that my name was "Shawn". They all found that funny. I didn't.
Children are curious about most things.
But -- especially about things which are (so obviously) being withheld.
"Shawn" ??
Why ?
Dunno.
I'll have to look into that.
I think about Katy (Finley) often.
And -- the other 5 of them too.
And Pip.
Ange.
Mom.
Rosie.
Like it or not -- y'all are my family.
I ‚ù§
 yas.
Hmm.
lol
                             Ditto.
Hmm.
And BG.
We had the same name -- and the same sense of humor.
Haha.  üòä
Sometimes -- when the 6 of us were together -- I'd make a joke -- and nobody would "get it" -- except for her.
I loved that.
That's touching. How nice.
Yes.   'Twas.
Thank you.
Painful times for me.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
But -- some nice "lights" at times too.
Bood.
So.               How was your week (this past) ?
I need to think about that question for a minute... and Darjeeling is here nipping at my toes, probably signalling that she needs some more food. I'll be back shortly after I put some into her dish. BRB...
                             Take your time Pip.
           You are worth w8ing 4 !!
Okay. Thanks. I have returned.
Okay.   Thanks.   Good to see you again.
Darjee is dining now ?
My past Week has been mostly bood, I think. I didn't make progress on every task I had hoped I might be able to attend to, but I did get some important things done and prepared somewhat to either relax my ambitions, or try to do more that seems worth doing better ahead.
Yes, Darjee is dining.
I think that is a pretty good 168-hour report.
Thank you.
You're welcome. How was your Week?
Productive.
Thank you for asking.
URwLcome.
I had my annual "apartment inspection" yesterday.
And -- that always means that I need to give the place a good scrubbing.
Usually 12 to 16 hours of effort.
My body is acutely reminded of its age during this process !!
I customarily spread the work out over 2 or 3 days --
Wow! That's way more than I have done in 6-Years living in Captain's-Cove here. I do *not* scrub anything for hours (Yearly, or per-Decade even)!
so that I can handle it without major consternation.
lol
You don't have inspections (normally) in an 8-unit (privately-owned) building.
Correct.
But our building is 156 units -- which are a governmentally subsidized operation.
And they want to assure that we are complying with their ordained rules.
So.   We get inspecticated !!
üòä
Yeah. Makes sense.  üòä
Happy to report -- I passed with flying colors.
This was not the case last year.
One infraction in 2020.
But I fixed it -- and was then given --
Your units identifiers could consist of merely a single 0 (Zer0), 1 (One), or 2 (Two) followed by either an UpperCase (A-Z) letter, or a lower-case (a-z) letter.
          the gold star.
The system they use is:  2-digit floor, plus unit number on that floor.
So -- I am:    1008.
We are a 14-story building.
No apartments on #1.
13 floors x 12 apartments per = 156.
Yeah. You could use $_ =~ m/^[012][A-Z]$/i; for just 2 characters covering all 156 units (with the first character just being one of three design8ors).
Top floor is #15.
You could get 3 decks of standard (probably Hoyle) playing cards with different color backs && design8 any unit in your building with just a single one of those. I am Pip. I am very ThirTeen. It suits me!  üòâ
lol
HTTPS://YouTu.be/c5NW2E_seMI
One of my favor8 Obsidia tracks titled: "ThirTeen"
Well -- my Saturday is gone now.
Bye-bye SatUrDay.
Emmy still has 3 more hours to celebrate.
Yeah. Hopefully she was cherished and nicely gifted through her BirthDay.
I loaded your link.
Thank you.
I suspect she was.
I ‚ù§
 her.
And them.
I have great plans for their family.
You're welcome. Obsidia usually doesn't rely on many lyrics, but if you can turn the bass-level up, you'll probably appreC8 why I dig him the most.  üòä
May I please inquire as to what some of your gr8 plans for their family are?
Noted.   Thank you.
Sure.
Travel -- for one.
Nice.
Possibly for Mandy & Tim too.
But mostly -- for my grans.
I plan to show them things.
And -- mostly -- in what Dot and I used to call "two-time".
Like what things do you plan to show them?
Two-time is when I would go out with just you alone -- without Mom, Ange, or Tim going along.
Did the same with Tim, and with Angie too.
Yeah. Mom carried on that tradition under the moniker: "Special-Time"
And (of course) Mom and I had "two-time" excursions also.
Yeah.
Williamburg, Virginia was one of the great ones I especially remember.
3 days, that one.
Well -- not exactly 2-time.
More like 2¬Ω-time.
May of 1980.
Tim was with us.
Mom was 5 months pregnant then.
Cool.
'Twas.
Thank you.
Very nice weekend.
I'm glad to hear that Mom continued doing that for you-guys.
I believe that is an important parenting activity.
I first learned of it from Susanna Wesley.
Gr8.
She had 19 children -- and she made it her business to have "two-time" with each of them frequently.
So -- Dot and I did it with you-all too.
Yes.   It *was* cool.
Probably a bood practice.
I cannot imagine anyone being a better wife for me -- or a mother for the 3 of you.
We all were very fortunate.
You had asked about what plans I have for Katy, Emmy, Paul, and Duke.
I want to take them to the places that I like to go to when I travel.
I can have a pretty hard time considering myself fortun8 to have the family I do these Days.
Whenever I get to go to a new town -- my favorite places to visit are:  industrial tours.
And -- when one takes a child to such venues -- tons of questions come up for them.
This ends up not only being enjoyable for us -- but it is extremely stimulating for their minds.
That's what I want to do -- a lot.
But -- I have some other plans brewing as well.
Thank you for asking, Pip.
You said:
" I can have a pretty hard time considering myself fortun8 to have the family I do these Days. "
You're welcome. Thanks for answering so nicely.
You're welcome Pip.
I understand your current "hard times".
Things will change.
And -- you will see quite differently -- as they do.
Maybe not today or tomorrow.
         But                                                 soon.
üòä
I'm sorry if my "hard times" make me sometimes more of a crude and cruel bastard than maybe I should be.
You "should be" exactly as you are Pip.
You will go through this.
And you will change.
When it is your time.
I am in no hurry.
I can w8.
You are worth waiting for.
                     I've believe I've said that B4.
In what way(s) will I change?
üòä
Well -- good Q Pip.
There are a number of ways to answer that question.
Mostly -- you will change -- in the ways that you determine that it would be profitable to you to change.
As many as you could provide, I'd be glad to rEad and ponder.
But -- there also may be other ways that you will change (that will also be profitable to you) -- which you will not have (knowingly) kindled.
Enough of an answer -- for now ?
Or ?
Almost.
Can you please explain why you twice wrote "... profitable *to* you" instead of "... *for* you"?
Good Q Pip.
Prepositions are "funny" things.
There are nearly 100 of them.
But only about 15 (or so) that we use on a regular basis.
And -- I truly mean:  *very* regularly !!
It is nearly impossible to construct most sentences -- with at least one in it.
However -- a number prepositions are somewhat interchangeable.
s/(with)/$1out/;
"to" and "for" are one of those sets.
"of" and "from" are another set.
s/(number) /$1 of /;
# Don't mind me. Just tidying up some of your sentences with what I presume are minor corrections (using P.C.R.E.);  üòä
Yes -- thank you -- my "with" should have been "without".
üòä
That's what the first Perl-Compatible-Regular-Expression I wrote did. $1 is the parenthetical capture group.
You're welcome.
Also -- "number" should have been "number of".
Second PerlCompatRegEx did that (again using $1).
Oh.   You just flagged me on that one too.     Thank you Pip.
üòä
Yep.
So "... profitable *to* me" means essentially the same thing as "... profitable *for* me" would, or are there any slight distinctions?
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
                           You are my teacher.
üòä
What distinctions would you suggest ?
You teach me sometimes too Daad. I loov yoou tooo.  üòâ
lol
Well "... profitable *for* me" seems to be the normally used phrase indic8ing that maybe some profit is mine to attain, while "... profitable *to* me" seems to be odd but perhaps connote that an external source would be presenting me with profit (to be received) somewhat instead?
Good observations Pip.
Thank you.
 I agree --

There are times when "to" and "for"
tend not to be interchangeable.

But -- when they seem to be --
which one the speaker uses is
(usually) about which one sounds
best -- or feels more appropriate.
Cool. Thanks for helping me understand that.
S'ok.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Also, you don't mean "profitable" literally, correct? It's figur8ive and not meant as merely monetary, but instead like just generally beneficial to me somehow?
Yes.   Correct Pip.
Thanks again.
I can't think of anytime that I have (ever) used the word "profitable" -- to mean moneyish.
You're welcome again.
üòä
Thank you.
Tim is not happy with the situation between himself (and his family) -- and you, Philip.
I might have a somewhat skewed perspective because before we began chatting, I was working on matching some Octology code to Beppu-san's Mad-Scientists-Lab code that has an executable file named: "profit-loss" which I modeled one of mine after.
He grapples with it.
It makes him uneasy -- but --
he does (not yet) know how to fix it.
Time will pass.
You will get smarter.
How do you know this?
So will he.
Things will change.
When it is their time.
to you all.
üòä
Another (very) good Q Pip.
I know my children.
Mom & I taught you guys (a little bit) by telling you things.
But -- so much more -- by the examples of how we "lived" in your presence.
Our ways of being -- in your midst.
These "teachings" are absorbed by children.
And they stick.
The child may (for a time) stray from them.
But -- they *always* return.
Always.
In fact -- this is not only a "parent/child" thing.
Storg?
Each person "rubs off" on anyone (everyone) around them -- in the same way.
And -- the good "rub-off" always either endure or return.
The non-profitable "rub-offs" cannot endure.
Why not?
Maybe for a short time, yes.   But not for too long.
Each person is his/her own greatest teaching.
And -- each person reaches a time in their "days" -- when they say to their "self" :::
     "Hmm.   This ain't profitable to/for me"
"I think it's time for me to quit this activity -- or mindset."
(//)
Sorry.
Missed an "s" in this line.
Should have been:
And -- the good "rub-offs" always either endure or return.
/greatest teaching/  /greatest teacher/
That's okay... but I *do* urge you to learn PCRE. That would have been: s/(off)/$1s/;
... && s/(teach)ing/$1er/;
For my first interjected query comment above: s/(Storg)/$1e/;
... && Why can't non-profitable "rub-offs" endure?
Another grreat question Pip.
Thank you.
God knows that ...
Few of us wish to "learn" stuff from Him.
And -- He also knows that:   some of us do not believe He exists.
And -- He also knows that:   some of us who *do* believe He exists.-- do not want to learn stuff from Him anyway.
He knows all that about us.
And much more.
Well -- of course -- He made us.
Certainly He knows us.
How we think.
And -- how we learn.
And -- how we *like* to learn.
He also knows that we are (basically) not stupid.
But that we wish to "journey down the road" of stupidity --
     in our search for wisdom.
Speak for yourself! Maybe *you're* (basically) not stupid.  üòâ
Which -- He knows -- that we will all (finally) come to --
     whether we get any help from Him --
     or do it all (think it all out) on our own.
That which serves me -- I shall continue.
That which does not serve me -- I shall quit.
But (on that second one) -- maybe I shall quit it today.
     Or tomorrow.
But -- much more probably --
     I (like Mo and the boys) -- I shall not quit it --
     for about 40 years or so.
He can live with that.
3652 days ain't such a long time for him to wait.
It's merely a blink of an eye to Him.
(//)
Did I answer that one sufficiently Pip ?
I'm digesting it...
Good.
     Chew away Son.
Why do we want to "journey down the road" of stupidity in search of wisdom?
Another terrifico Pip.
How is that (basically) *not* stupid?
lol
lol                  lol                  lol                  lol                  lol

 you Pip.
lol
üòä
  heh
‚ù§
you too Dad.
Wanna take a crack at your own question Pip ?
Or -- me should ?
I don't have a bood guess yet. You can please go ahead.
Ok.
Wilco.
But -- you are still typing.
s/3652/14,610/; # 40-Years "Forty", not 10 "Ten"
I shall wait.
Just quick RegEx correction.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Should have said:       14,610 days.
Is that better ?
My PCRE already fixed it, if you could just understand the syntax.
Sometimes I understand your PCRE.
Sometimes I do not.
Remember ::: I am not as sharp as you.
     And Angie.
üòä
They are super-useful. You should sharpen yourself.
Be patient with me please.
That's what I have you for Pip.
     You are my sharpener/teacher.
I try. Difficult. Larry Wall (father of Perl Programming Language) says: "The 3 virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Imp8ience, && Hubris!"
lol
Ok.   To your question now -- I shall go ?
Yes, please.
Good.
Thank you.
Follows.
"How is that (basically) *not* stupid ?"
Answer:
You'll remember -- I said:
"He (God) also knows that we are (basically) not stupid."
The key word in there is:  "basically".
However -- we are *like* our Father.
And -- our Father enjoyed working things out for Himself.
And we -- being like Him -- (also) enjoy working things our for ourselves.
And yes -- on the surface -- this appears to be tainted with "a stupidity".
But -- it is not.
It is merely (and beautifully) us -- "playing out" -- the true who of ourselves.
We are being God.
The Son of God.
The Proof of God.
God in a skinsuit.
Why do we *want to do it on our own* ?
To prove to ourselves that we (truly) *are* God.
     He's got nothin' on us.
We are equal to Him.
We are One with Him.
Is this enough of an answer for that one Pip.
Perhaps.
     Or -- did you want more ?
(//)
Perhaps ?
You are God Pip.
You don't know that yet.
But you will.
When it is your time to come to know it.
Maybe *you* are "One" with Him, but I'm not! Are you saying I eventually will "play-out" the true who of myself and become God, Son of God, Proof in SkinSuit, which I've wanted to do (and done) on my own?
You cannot not come to it.
That is why you are here on the earth.
How is "equal to Him" also "One with Him"?
To discover (uncover) your true Self.
Good Q Pip.
Equal is not congruent.
Equal is equal in value, and capabilities.
You and your Father will still have distinctive personalities.
But -- the 2 of you shall always be equal in value, and capabilities.
Now -- Oneness.
This "oneness" is a oneness in spirit.
God is a spirit.
But I'm not a spirit.
As also (when we toss away your sklinsuit) -- you are a spirit.
And -- that spirit is One.
And -- His spirit is love.
And -- your spirit is love.
That's what you are.
And who you are.
Yes -- I saw your insert.
You do not know that you are God yet.
You do not know that you are a spirit yet.
How could I even know that I am supposedly a spirit? What is a spirit?
You have not yet worked-it-out for yourself.
I may have said it to you.
But you -- being God -- don't take the tellin' of no one -- on the who of you.
And that is exactly how it should be.
How is was meant to be.
How it was designed to be.
How it must be.
Believeth your human Dad not.
Do not believe me when I tell you that you are God.
Wouldn't His, or my (, or whoever's) spirit that you say is "love"... wouldn't true "love" need to know (and be known)?
     You must find it out for your self.
Which you will.
     When it is you time.
(//)
Wouldn't His, or my (, or whoever's) spirit that you say is "love"... wouldn't true "love" need to know (and be known)?
Great Q Pip !!
     And the answer is ?
Go for it Pip.
     You know this one.
Nobody even knows what a "god" technically must be (or is), much less that one (or "One-Three-Part-God-Head") exists... && what that would mean.
Without those, God being a spirit... which is supposedly "love" is pretty senseless, I think.
Of course you do.
     And thinking -- you can not stop.
And it is that very thinking -- that will finally bring you to conclude --
the the true who of you -- can be no other than your source.
You made you.
And then you put you into a skinsuit --
      to come down here to figure it all out.
How beautiful you are Pip !!
üòä
Hmm. Maybe.   =]
/the the/  /that the/
lol
Ye say "maybe".
     And the day shall come (not yet afar off) --
          when ye shall say:           "Ah ha!"
üòä
Ah... ahem... hmph!  üòâ

Tears For Fears Everybody Wants To Rule The World w/ Lyrics
Tears For Fears Everybody Wants To Rule The World w/ Lyrics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0xBWPHHzBw
I don't want to rule the World if someone else can rule it better than I can... but then I guess, yeah, I *do* want to rule it still too. Got me.
I don't want to rule the World forever though, just for 978-ish Years (until Year: 3,000 in this Common-Era).  üòõ
L7PM1GHT
Just wanting to stamp:  SunDay, July 25th 01:16:17:29 -0500 (zone) of 2021 (Year C.E.);
Yep -- you said:
"I don't want to rule the World forever though, just for 978-ish Years (until Year: 3,000."
Of course you would say that!
See 3:30 into video.
"Nothing Ever Lasts ForEver!" hmm... well "Nothing" && "Ever" there both *do* seem to last maybe "ForEver"!
lol
You're the boss Pip !!
lord = boss
You may call me: "El Jeffe!"  üòâ
Jeffe ?
"Boss" en Espan~ol.
How would turning your back on Mother-N8ure be acting on your "best behavior"?
Ah yes.   Thank you.   The Boss = El Jeffe.
Good one Pip.
Yes.   How would it ?
Also 1m:32secs also has "Nothing Ever..." earlier than 3m:30secs repeat.
Or maybe turning your back on Mother-N8ure is what you'd be doing by wanting to rule the World?
I'm not sure.
To afentik√≥ = the boss (Greek)
You'll finger it out Pip.
üòä
I might finger it out (with a *bang*!) ... perhaps someDay. We'll see. I really dig that song, but haven't ever known so many of the lyrics. I suspect few people have genuinely thought about "ruling" the World as much as I have. I've drafted many rel8d plans. That (in-and-of-itself) doesn't mean I'm necessarily better qualified to do so, but it might be an important "leg-up".
Good comments Pip.
Thank you.
# Dad usually pastes into our Google HangOuts Chat windows a bunch of clip-art images that it's kinda sad cannot be copied inline in the logs here. They're
#   getting lost most of the time. Oh well. The text is primary anyway, but images are unfortun8ly a big part of what he relies on to communic8 his intentions.
# Right here, Dad pasted in an image (twice, second time attempting different scaling, which didn't work) showing the Tears4Fears lyrics which I'm typing now:
"EveryBody Wants To Rule The World"
Welcome to your life.
There's no turning back.
Even while we sleep,
we will find you
acting on your best behavior.
Turn your back on Mother N8ure.
EveryBody wants to rule the World.
It's my own design.
It's my own remorse.
Help me to decide.
Help me make the most of freedom
and of pleasure.
Nothing ever lasts forever.
EveryBody wants to rule the World.
There's a room where the light won't find you.
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down.
When they do, I'll be right behind you.
So glad we've almost  ...   made it.
So  sad we ("they"?) had to fade it.  # L7QMFEAR:Pip here wrapping up transcribed lyrics from song that were pasted twice as images. Dad says: "Important!" =);
Sorry.   Tried to get a larger size.
Apparently didn' t work.
Fine. Thanks.
Welcome.
üòä
I still don't understand turning your back on Mother-N8ure. I don't understand "It's my own remorse."
"Help me to decide" ... decide what (besides making the most of freedom and pleasure)?
I don't think everybody truly wants to rule the World.
Excellent Pip.
Chewing will bring you all of your answers.
If they did, they'd take it (at least somewhat) seriously and have plans to do so somehow effectively.
lol
Is the "room where the light won't find you" a metaphor for a coffin underground dead, or something else?
Actually -- you need no help from me on all this.
     You are El Jeffe !!
Hmm. I don't get these lyrics hardly at all yet.
Am I included in the "we" who will find [me] when asleep? I'll be found acting on my best behavior also during sleep, or that part is when awake? I don't get it.
Holding whose hands while what walls come tumbling down?
Keep asking those questions Pip.
That is the whole key -- to everything.
Behind me, in this dark room with no light finding us? How close behind? Am I leading us back to light and visibility somehow?
Of course.
Absolutely.
But -- not until it is time.
And -- only El Jeffe can say "when".
So glad we've almost made it. So sad we had to fade it. Hmm.
And -- why did we have to fade it ?
Why did you fade it -- El Jeffe ?
Well if I've faded light, it's probably primarily because I believe dark backgrounds on computer and TV displays are much better, to then focus on the small bright beaming lights of text and images to discern. Screens are not simply luminous paper. Black text on web-pages and applic8ion program interfaces should be illegal! Fade those screens, toggle the contrasts. Focus on light. Don't burn yourself blind with glaring raD8ion in giant High-Dynamic-Range stupid intense lumens or whatever. That's why I did it, and would do it again && again.  üòõ
Excellent Pip.    Good comments -- but you have only scratched the very surface of what this "fading" is talking about.
Roland, Ian, and Chris (in 1985) intended much more to the meaning of this line.
     Keep chewing -- and asking questions Pip.
You are El Jeffe.
I'm in an almost always over-cast St8 of WisConSin, which can be like a "room" where the light won't find me. There's nothing like glorious CaliForNia SunShine here.
lol
Amen.
So sad they had to fade out the Sun for me here?
You will not be there for long.
Pip & Gerry are returning.
So that I could knock down the walls of Hell and Purg8ory and return to SouthernCali to be back in the light, at long last?
Maybe Ange too.
Not sure about Mom & Rosie yet.
But -- once the other 9 of us are there --
     I suspect they will not be long behind.
Hmm. Interesting.
And -- mega joyful too !!
Maybe knocking down Decimal (Base10 "Ten") numbers will be like walls too.
I'm knocking down "good" versus "bad", "good" versus "evil", and maybe also "good" versus "ill".
Well -- Emmy's day ended 10 minutes ago.
Octology is knocking down crucifixion crosses and establishing 8plc ones (like in HTTPS://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology/raw/master/gfx/sho/Octology-cros-shot_3840x2160-K44MHuBF.png ).
Octology is knocking down 10 ("Ten") Commandments for 96 (or 1,391) executable Commands.
2 celeb dates for the Long Beach Stuart Family in August.
Then -- 1 in September.
And then Katy -- on November 4th.
Octology is knocking down houses-of-cards with flaming dice and dominoes. HaDouKen!
Octology is knocking down 4-Dimensional "Space-Time" for 1+Dimensional Time, which is not str8, is not linear, is not unidirectional, is not necessarily discrete (or continuous), is fundamentally curved and coiling and may be thick waves of its own that give rise to space and forces, gravit8ion, orbits, "heavenly" bodies, etc..
"heavenly" ??          Define please ?
Octology is knocking down Mathematics and both Standard-Imperial, as well as Metric-System, units.
"heavenly" bodies = stars, planets, asteroids, meteors, comets, quasars, black-holes, galaxies, nebula, dark-matter, dark-energy, the known "observable" visible (and invisible) universe and cosmos, etc..
Got it.   Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm showing a 12-minute lull -- but it also
The shortest non-abrupt traversal between two positions in space follows curving coils (basically riding on waves). The universe doesn't *do* str8 lines, hardly at all, hardly ever, hardly anywhere. Idealized abstract math concepts, like perfectly str8 x,y,z 3-Dimensional perpendicular axes of purportedly infinite positive and neg8ive extension are horribly artificial and unrepresent8ive of actual physical phenomena. Ninety (90) degree "Right" angles are technically very "Wrong!" so ditch all this idealism and embrace surfing the (not merely "tidal", but instead...) tsunami waves of time (which eman8 almost into eternity, for most intents and purposes, surging and flowing back across each other into the vastly distant past and futures, washing back and colliding into the flowing present now). Blam! Reality is a sp8, and is rarely (if ever) str8. Cogit8 on our situ8ion m8!
looks like you have been typing.
Ah yes.
You have.
Comments noted.   But not understood.
You can say more ?
I can. Please try to re-formul8 any portions you have been able to grasp, then ask about something still perplexing.
Maybe I should point out that this declar8ion is primarily in response to the classic Mathematical assertion that: "The shortest distance between two (2) points is a str8 line."
Ah.   I think I get it better now, thank you.
I declare that if str8 exists in the universe, it barely exists, and barely persists for long. Infinity of any sort may be anathema to life.
You're welcome.
Well, maybe infinite time (i.e., "eternity") might be the only infinitude that could be preferable to exist and persist. Beyond that though, I suspect no other infinities are likely to be sufficiently safe to allow, explore, exert, or employ. Limited finite beings who live constrained should not be indulging boundlessness. Our living bodies and minds need rel8ively stable and consistent extents.
I find the bulk of that last paragraph's comments to be quite reasonable.
I'm not certain of this stuff. It's just an approxim8ion of my gr8st and deepest thinking about these topics, so far.
Nice! Thank you.
I appreciate it.
You're welcome.
And thank you.
‚ù§
Well I think I've expressed some of my most extreme perspectives on the n8ure of reality there. Do you have anything on your PCA for toNight? I realize it's nearly 4AM there for you, and the SunRise is approaching. I'm not yet particularly tired though.  ‚ù§
I'm still fully with you.
Cool.
I have some PCAs -- but the 2 majors are not yet fully developed
-- so will have to be pushed.
Thank you for asking.
Okay. You're welcome.
What about any other PCAs for you ?
Can you please try to install CygWin?
Or Docker? Either one.
I believe I declined on that suggestion previously.
I think I'll stick for now -- if I may.
I consider myself so very fortunate --
to have been given you through Mom.
             You are such a gift !!!
If you got either CygWin or Docker installed properly, there's a high likelihood that you could easily and safely install and run most of Octology. Then you could begin learning about it first-hand... and I could guide you to comprehend the significance of what it does, how, and why.
Thanks Dad. You're a gift in some ways too!
Ouch.             The terrible "in some ways" clarifier.
         I am so woonded !!
lol
Sorry I have to qualify it. I don't want to misrepresent things as though I see everything as a gift, when I don't and can't yet (if ever).
lol
I understand (and highly appreciate) your desire to be fully accurate.
I just couldn't pass up the chance to "play" offended.
üòä
Even if you just watched all my YouTube videos that fE8ure parts of Octology and studied the files on GitHub.Com , you should become able to start learning what may inform your own computing experience. I wish you would please study Octology and start asking thoughtful questions about it, so that you could get closer to running parts of it yourself.
Heh. I understand. I am offensive. I know.  üòä
Heh heh.   I never said you were offensive.
I just found it fun to act offended.
üòä
Cool. I aim to offend often.  üòú
                      Humph!
SnowFlake! Go find a "safe-space" to pout in.  üòõ
                    Did you just call me a flake ?!
And -- when I want to really pout --
     I'll be sure to do it in your backyard.
‚ù§
I hurl blue-fire and fragile easily-offended "SnowFlake" droplet-crystals get vaporized!
Nice.
Yes.               I yam nice.
Do you think I could have a Dragon-like spirit, or a Centaur instead (or in addition to) maybe?
You can pretend to have any spirit you wish to have.
                Permission granted.
But just remember --
I seriously doubt I have any spirit whatsoever, but Wolf is pretty adamantly convinced that I have a most powerful Blue-Dragon spirit. It sometimes seems to maybe fit me too well... so I'm curious to gather other people's opinions about whether there might be more reason to think so, or not.
                      Your true spirit is Love.
And -- I have been instructed to call you --
                             El Jeffe.
How can a spirit that is "Love" be identified, recognized, confirmed, affirmed, compartmentalized, utilized, equipped, reprimanded, etc.?
What can a "Love" spirit do, and not do? How is it detected?
Love gives.
Oh yeah. Thanks for reminding me.
          I know.      That is just review.
But you give to me.
What ?
What do you give to me ?
You give me you.
And -- in doing that -- you be Love.
           Thank you Pip.
           ‚ù§
You're welcome for reminding you.
               You need it !!
üòä
You're welcome Dad. Thank you for giving parts of yourself to me and loving me too.  ‚ù§
"parts" ?!
                  Am I offended again.
Naa.     I choose knot this time.
üòä
Heh. Maybe. I just assume we can only share parts of ourselves with each other. PerChance you thing otherwise?
I love to love you Pip.
           ‚ù§
s/thing/think/;
Hmm.   Thank you.   I understood that PCRE.
         (applause for me goes here)
[Applause!]
             Thank you very much.
Hmm.   Looks a little like Katy behind Simon there.
Oh.
I don't know what Tim and Amanda's kids look like. Maybe someDay I will become able to rel8 to them. Maybe they'll even learn Octology and could help improve it.
Maybe I should make a few comments on --
why I've chosen certain nicknames --
for my first 3 grans.
Okay.
     Finley      :::  Katy is in honor of Mandy's Mom.
     Emerson :::  Emmy is just an obvious.
     Crew        :::  Paul is in honor of Mandy's Dad.
                           It is also one of his 2 middle names.
Katy's middle name is Katheryn.
Response to your last paragraph -- (1)  Yes, you will.   (2) Yes, they might.
Cool.
Yes, you are Pip.
‚ù§
I believe I might have a recent photo of Katy.
Let me see if I can find it for you.
BBSh.
You're cool too Dad. Okay. Thanks. Take your time. I can w8.
Ah.   I am not offended when you call me a Coolio.
Thank you Pip.
üòä
üòä
Ok.   I think I've found one.
Uh.   Katy would be the one on the right.   Duh.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I think there is one more too.
BBSh.
I believe the one about was circa July 2020.
The next one -- Halloween 2018.
I have no clue what she might be holding.
          Do you ?
I think she is supposed to be dressed as a pilgrim.
             But what is she holding ?
/about/  /above/
She's a Supreme-Court-Justice holding a gavel.
Really.    Is that what the white doodad signifies ?
It looked like a gavel to me too --
but I couldn't quite put the pilgrim & the gavel together.
I think you got it Pip.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Anyway.   Those are the only 2 recents I have of Katy.
Thank you for sharing the picture with me. It's bitter-sweet seeing family I don't know and who seems to not care to know me.
You have the "newborn" photo on your coffee mug.
s/(picture)/$1s/;
I do have the "new-born" photo on my coffee mug, yes.
Believe me.    The 4 of them *do* wish to know you.
But the time is not yet for that to happen.
           "yet" = key word
Rest in --
Thy day cometh soooon.
Okay. I don't know how you could know that they *do* want something they could have right away just by e-mailing or calling me, yet they don't. Dubious. Doubtful.
Yes.   Those are the pipelines   But their parents will not open the valve -- until it is the ordained time.
Peas & an patience are the watchwords.
Yeah. I'd probably just prefer to rebuild a rel8ionship with Tim alone first. Amanda and kids (and pets) could be best to forge l8r.
 /an/  /and/
I suspect you are absolutely correct on that sequence.
Very good Pip.
When you guys are both ready -- it will happen.
Peas.
Hopefully. I will try to be p8ient and avoid becoming so bitter that I reject chances when they might arise.
Well --
since you've said that -- I think I'll share some of my own --
mullings -- along those lines.
I also -- am cut off from most of the members of my close family.
Pain ?   Yes -- had been some.
But now I understand it better -- and am at peas with it.
How did I come to that peas ?
Well -- Pieces 27, and 5b and (especially) #11.
And while "asking a zillion questions" (#11) --
I found that tons of other (non-family) friends -
have fallen out of communication with --
me -- in spite of the fact that I have --
sent both birthday & Christmas cards --
to them for many (many!) years.
Why is this ?
And here is the gift (Pc#27) that I have come up with.
These people are people who are being (temporarily) --
pulled out of my life (by my Father) --
so that I will have ample time to dedicate --
to why I was (am) sent to this earth --
to begin with.
Now.   I get it.
The (temporary) loss of contact with --
this people that I love -- and wish to --
spend time with -- is a gift from My Father.
‚òú(Ôæü„ÉÆÔæü‚òú)/  /these/
And -- the key word (again) -- is -- "temporary".
(//)
Yeah. Maybe being ostracized/excommunic8d had/has 1-or-more purposes. Could be temporary.
Hmm.   That correction did not show us correctly.
Try again.
‚òú(Ôæü„ÉÆÔæü‚òú)/  /these/
Thanks for rel8ing your perspective on it. Helps me to learn of it.
no work again
"this" should have been "these".
There.  That's better.
You're welcome Pip.
I suspect that may also be the same kind of gift to you.
However.   I know what He wants me to spend my time on.
Sup to you to figure out what He --
has "cleaned out" your contacts for.
      You'll find it.
Hopefully.
Well shall we please wrap up our chat for the Night?
May we plan to re-convene next FriDay EveNing at our usual time, if possible?

I have one more thing.
Hold on please.
Sun Jul 25 04:30:54:40 -0500 2021
Okay. Holding on...
Ok.   I have it.
Thank you for your patience.
You're welcome.
I've just *got* to share one more photo with you.
This one was taken on Aunt Ginny's 60th birthday.
That would have been on Sunday, April 19, 2020.

But the thing that struck me was that --
although Ginny was 60 -- and Dot almost 68
-- they both looked about 30 !!
Don't you think ?
Nope.
lol
Ok.
Whatever you say Pip.
You're El Jeffe.             And I must remember that!

Thank you Pip -- for a very excellent chat

Until you do this, please stop p8ronizing me, blowing-smoke up-my-ass with bull-shit that rings hollow and disingenuous, blathering about me being "El Jeffe" or your "Teacher". You have to learn something. Once done, I'll become less ir8 && irritable about your superficiality which flies-in-the-face of your stubborn smug shite. I rE-readd all 9-hours of our L7OMJk-L7PM4k chat from last WeekEnd && maybe you should too. I've been as p8ient as I can be with you. Shape-up, or eat your own entrails! Stop infurE8ing me with self-satisfied obstinance. Sharpen your knowledge, or languish as dull && dumb without my involvement. I was too nice last time. Stop sickening me please, && do something honorable with determin8ion or expect I'll be increasingly dismissive, aloof, && disinterested in further dialog with you! Sorry that I don't feel loving toward you right now, but I'll see if I can find a warmer place in my mind where I can perhaps become more compassion8 && less adversarial against you again. Please do *your* part, if you can. Thanks! G.G.P.O.! üòû

L7UMJULY  -==-  Fri Jul 30 19:30:21:34 -0500 2021 Common.Era. (fuck A.D.!)  ... I'm pretty livid because I've had a bunch of fools trying to kill me again this past Week and I need money badly && have no effective means of getting anyone to give me any. I need new speakers since my old ones blew-out after 8 bood Years of loyal service && I h8 being deprived of my music, when I have many difficult && important things to do. Most of my clothes are falling apart... && so are my sk8-shoes, my car, my rel8ionships, my situ8ion, && too much of my entire life! Sorry if I'm taking it out on you disproportion8ly to your failures. Please send me money, to tangibly diminish by intensifying stress. I'd become gr8ful, if I could. Ugh. I'm shredded in angst && boiling with bile right now! Bleh. Not much (if any) love in any other living person's direction from me right now. I am *not* God. I am *not* Spirit. I am *not* Son. I am *not* Proof. I am *not* Love. I am searing blue blazing dragon fury. *Roar*... HaDouKen!

Gute Morgen Philipino.
Bood Morn Geraldo.
How be ya ?
I'm cool, listening to AK1200 FullyAutomatic && thinking of playing some StreetFighter in a while. How be ye?
Better.
             Thank you for asking.
No prob.
I have a question.
Do you?
Eye dew.
üòä
Permiso ?
Denied. Ooh! That's gotta hurt.  üòâ
  Just-Kidding. Ask.
sniff       sniff
Oh.             I see (now) that you said "just kidding".                    
Thank you Pip.
Question is:
How do we know that the photo that
I sent you (at the top of this chat)
is a sunrise -- and not a sunset ?
Beats me.
Ah ha.
I'll fix that when I come to Wisconsin to see you.
You may remember --
Don't bother.
Photo identific8ion is something computers do better than us anyway.
I said that I want to take you to --
a few places in Michigan.
Well -- one of those places is Mackinac Island.
And -- while in that area -- how would you --
like a hot-air balloon ride ?
I'd rather go back to L.A. than visit any more of this wasteland of corpse lakes.
Ok with me.
I'll come visit you there.
Balloon rides are not my cup-o-tea. Crystal-MethAmphetamine is.
They give hot-air balloon rides over Long Beach too.
And -- after you have had your first --
I'll watch you sail into a sunset or sunrise or whatever. Maybe you can identify which it is after the photo is developed?
hot-air balloon ride -- you will --
know the answer to the question.
Still not give a shit?
Ok.
             I withdraw the question.
I withdraw my penis.
Keeping you happy is my highest desire.
üòä
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You love essentially only your personal imaginary friend (i.e., "Father A.K.A. Tribal Evil Weather God") and your made up definitions for common words. You don't know me. You couldn't love me if love abounded.
Is that your final answer ?
Is that your final question?
lol
üòä
You know better than that !!
I never run out of Qs.
üòä
My stus won't allow it.
Questions drive the amelioration of our universe.
You run out of a lot of things you think will never run out. You have. You will. Who are your "stus"? They supposedly won't allow you to *ever* run out of questions, eh? You're all dumb as rocks.
                          You    rock    Philip    !!
Humans like us (and probably your imaginary stus) die permanently eventually. We cannot ask questions or do any particular thing forever.
I roll Gerardo. I bang. I fuck it sideways.
                     Wheel sea.
Not if you remain blind, deaf, dumb, and mute.
Did you have anything on your PCA for this chat Pip ?
s/(bang)\./$1!/;
Already written. #0 Can you learn?
Will you teach me ?
If you can't learn, nobody can teach you.
Is that your final answer ?
Are you ready to kick-the-bucket yet?
When would you like me to ?
Whenever you lost the ability to learn.
But I have already done that (according to your assessment).
                    So -- why am I still breathing ?
Because people don't die when they probably should.
Ah.
               And who determines the "should" time ?
Everybody can have their own determin8ions on such timings.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I know you don't.
                          You are (truly) a treasure.
You are deceived and a deceiver.
I thank Mom for you frequently.
Come to think of it -- 
Mom would like a visit from you.
My D.E.M.o.n.i.c. wannabe-goddess bitch of a son's vitality and vim drainer had deadly blood and you both amput8d part of my penis as soon as I was prem8urely born, without my permission. Fuck you both!
Mom should like a visit from the Reaper.
Grim, that is!  üòâ
You make me --
                       -- Philip.
You (and your circumstances) made yourself whatever emotion you mis-identify as having been made by just (or primarily) me. Take credit. Take a bow... and an arrow-of-time... and sin your heart out.
I'm not sure I understand that.
Could you say more about it please ?
I think you make yourself "happy" on your own. I am engaged to enrage!
Hmm.
Thank you.
May I mull on that a bit ?
Boil an egg.
May your BirthDay be filled with weeping and gnashing of teeth, being your worst one yet. I just wanted to make sure I got that in early too, for your "mulling" and mind-numbing to make you whatever you become... or whatever becomes of you.
Just one ?
Just one, in one basket, or casket. That's all.
Okeedoke.
                                  You are my Jeffe.
You are a shitty liar.
And -- thank you for the birthday greeting.
I was just wondering this morning if I would get a card from you again -- like I did 3 years ago.
I still have it sitting above my desk.
I see it every day.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thank you so much !!
Write a RegEx and I might write more to (and think more of) you.
Thank you Philip.
                                         Very nice of you to say so.
üòä
Have a blast!
üòä
Thank you.
                            Wilco Mr. Jeffe.
üòä
Maybe you'll get lucky.
Maybe this is more your flavor. I don't care.
Do your worst.
GGPO!
