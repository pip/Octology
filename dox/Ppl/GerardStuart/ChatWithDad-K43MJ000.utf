How was your week My Lord ?
üòä
I'm not sure. Weird. How about yours?
Speck-tack-you-lar !!
Tell me about your "weird" please.
Uhm, I don't know where to begin really either.
It's ok.
Just breathe.
I can w8.
üòä
Well I'm stricken by the number of deaths COVID-19 has caused.
Ok.
I'll have a question on that later.
But -- you are typing.
I'm worried it's on quite a war-path.
Go on please.
Worry is usually directed. 
What is your "at" or "about" ?
I don't know.
Worried about you -- getting it ?
I probably will at some point. Maybe converging from remote vantages.
Why ?
Do you want it ?
Probably not (unless I learned more about it being more survivable && good), but exposure to it seems to be nearly inevitable at some point. We'll see.
A question.
Puedo ?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
üòä
I ‚ù§ you Pip.
üòä I ‚ù§ you too Dad.
Are you following ...

The 6-point Plan ?
Good.
Probably a good plan. It seems so.
You do realize that following
that plan reduces your chances
of contracting the C-19 by
heaps & mounds --
don't you ?
Yes, but it sure seems aggressive.
Don't talk that way about    it.
I'm thinking ...
did you want me to
launch into my lesson
on "worry" ?
Well -- duyah, kid ?
Sorry. Don't know yet more appropriate ways.
You can. Maybe I need to hear it. I'm worried too many people are dying before ventil8ors can be provided to save their breathing.
I'm going to save the "Worry'll Kill Ya" lesson
for now.
And take a different tack.
Ok ?
Ok.
Good.
Thank you.
You have your 29 Pieces handy ?
Not exactly. I was caught up by other things.
Let me get them.
Ok.
Take your time.
I'll w8.
Got them.
Xcellent.  I've got mine too.
üòä
You're welcome for the "Thank you." just before querying for the 29.
You're phunny.
You make me smile.
I'd like to point you to
3 Pieces.  And I'd then like
to have you make no comments
on them.  And then I'd like to
ask you some questions.
All that sound ok ?
Yes.
Good.
10 Q
U R wLcome.
lol
Piece #1
Piece #5b
Piece #29
And now --
the first Q:
Did you say "thank you"
for the C-19 coming to us ?
Thank you for the C-19 coming to us.
Xcellent Pip.
Could you recite #5b ?
If yes -- please do.
There are no accidents in your universe.
Xcellent.
Now -- you know what is coming.
Here is the 3rd question.
And -- of course -- it is
Thank you for everything. All gifts. Gr!
based on #29.
Gr8!
Q follows:
Why       is it good ?
It's unclear to me why it is good so far.
Good answer.
May I tell you a little story ?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you for offering.
I shall.
üòä
You're wL-come.
Story follows.
Stuff happens.
And not all of it --
seems good.
We wonder about that.
I     wonder about that.
I say to myself:
"Why would a God -- who is
supposed to be so good --
and loving -- allow all
this garbage to descend
upon the children He
supposedly loves ?"
Well.  I asked myself that.
And "myself" could not
answer it.
So -- I decided to --
ask Him.
I said:  Father --
Right. Thank you.
why do you throw such
storms of garbage at
your cherished kids ?
He said:
"Pick one Gerry."
I said:  Oh.  A specific ?
He said:  Yes.  A specific.
I said:  Ok.
I've got one.
Divorce.
Where is the "gift" in that ?
He said:  Good one Gerry.
Lotsa people wonder about that.
But very few bother to
ask me about its giftiness.
The Bible suggests:
1 marriage.
And -- if it doesn't "take"
-- you don't get a "redo".
Seems pretty harsh of me.
Yes ?
Yes.
Yes.
But -- I'm not a dumb guy.
Lookit the sky.
Pretty nice.
Pretty organized.
I'm pretty smart.
I do great work.
So.   Couldn
Whoops.
So.  Couldn't I be
pretty smart in the
"only 1 marriage per customer"
department too ?
Don't answer that.
I am.
I am smart there too.
Thank you. You could be smart in every department && lots of not.
Imagine this.
A person gets married.
Expects it to last a lifetime.
It's a good marriage.
Great even.
But it ends before the person's
lifetime expires.
The person does not follow
the most common path --
which is:  to try again.
This is not only the norm.
It is what most "holy men"
sanction, endorse, and are
fully willing to stand "up-in-front"
and perform "all over again".
And -- in spite of the fact that
they have readd my book.
It's not that they don't "get it".
It's that they can't "sell it".
So they cave in -- and do
remarriage after remarriage
after remarriage -- and
on and on.
Well.
Enough on them.
Thank you.
Let's get back to
that "person" which we were
talking about.
Was married.
Great marriage.
But -- it ended.
The person did not get
remarried.
Because -- the book
suggested:  not to.
Now.  What did the person
do with his yen to enjoy
the blisses of marriage ?
He looked elsewhere
for that kind of relationship.
And then -- my Father said
to me:
Do you understand it now Gerry.
How divorce is a gift.
That is -- if -- you stay that way.
And don't remarry.
So.
I thunk it over.
And -- for years --
I didn't "get it".
And then -- finally --
I did.
And that was about 25
years ago (or so).
And then -- a few weeks
back -- I went to Him again.
And I said:
"Father -- this covid-19 thing.
I know it's a gift.
I know that from Piece 29.
And from Piece 5b.
But I don't quite see its
giftiness yet.
Could you give me
your glasses please ?"
And He said:
You already have them Gerry.
I gave them to you 25 years ago.
Same gift.
Same glasses will see it.
Ok Pip.
Would you like to finish
this story ?
Or...
You have a question ?
I don't have a good perspective on divorce or marriage.
Read back over this story.
The "person" was not some
hypothetical.
Your Dad was talking about
your Dad.
Yes. Thank you.
I don't know how to finish the story.
Your Dad had the most blissful
and blessed marriage in the
history of all time.  His wife was
the most spectacular wife any
man could ever wish for, hope
for, or ever desire.  He was
"over-the-moon" with joy --
and living on the mountaintops
every day of his life.
And then -- God said:
"You're welcome Gerry.
And now -- I'm going
to turn the page."
Are you starting to see it Pip ?
Yes. Page turns are gifts to be thankful for.
Ok.
Let me help a bit.
God (supposedly) loved
His favorite kids.
His "chosen people".
The Israelites.
But.
He put them through mess
after mess after mess
after mess.
Why ?  Because he planned
to bring them to the mountaintops.
Why has He dealt thus
with Gerry also ?
More mountaintops.
Higher even than the ones
back in Gerry's "marriage" days.
And not for Gerry only.
He wants to take many others
of His children to those same
lofty ranges.
But -- the "don't remarry" thing
is not being followed.
And when the Israelites did
not follow one commandment --
He gifted them into a brand new
situation -- far harsher than
the previous one.  And He
did that over and over again
with "His favorite kids".
Are you getting an idea here ?
Are you seeing the link
Somewhat.
between remarriage and C-19 ?
Each brand new situation is another gift with continuity.
Yes.
But it's all for the same end.
Father wants to give us something great.
Just as He gave "the promised land"
to The Israelites.
Covid-19 is simply
"Plan B" from God.
Because we (nearly universally)
have rejected Plan A.
Plan A was:
Don't remarry after your divorce.
In the 6-point Plan
which I had put up on the
screen -- which point tells
us where to stay ?
I'm not sure.
Points can be stays or aways?

The word            "stay".
Stay your hand, father. Be not quick or harsh to judge.
Sorry.
I'm (somehow) not being clear here.
Which of the 6 directives
in the chart above --
has the word "stay" in it ?
Sorry. The 5th with "Stay at Home".
Yep
üòä
You've got it.
When divorce happens --
God's suggestion is:
Stay at Home.
Do not go out
looking for a replacement.
But we don't do that.
We go out -- and look
for a new spouse.
God put up with that
for a long time --
and when His longsuffering
of our disobedience came to
its end -- He said to Himself:
Ok.  Maybe the Coronavirus
will get my message across.
(//)
Holy God! His message should get across.
He wants us to Stay at Home.
And do what ?
Learn His messages?
Yes.   Assuredly.
But even more so :::
ask Him questions.
After a divorce --
He wants us to
ask Him questions.
And so.
With the Coronavirus
He wants us to
Stay at Home
and ask Him questions.
I've been a terrible specimen of humanity in my own eyes && in God's then, if he chose to observe.
I should be repentant && change my ways.
Why ?
Because if God can listen && voice a response amidst discussion, then there could be few doubters who could just verify to whatever length.
Go on.
Maybe I should get the challah && attempt a brachah over it?
Sure.
I can w8.
Take your time.
üòä
Ok. Thank you. Sorry to make you w8. Be right back...
Breathe Pip.
I'm not going anywhere.
‚ù§
Thank you. ‚ù§ 
Are you always upstairs of upstairs, in some form or another?
Not sure what you mean by that.
Or your Father in Heaven is, rather?
Help ?
I'm not sure what I meant by it either. Just a sens8ion of proximity, despite distance.
Nevermind that.
ok
Does the Son of God need crosses amidst a throne?
Not me.
I'm a son of man.
I just wonder if crosses are more a symbol of death than resurrection?
Absolutely.
And they are very new too.
God hates them.
Easter is not about "the Friday before".
It is about "the Sunday after" !!
Well thank God for having a plan.
Does our Father in Heaven have plans for this Pesach?
What do you think ?
Probably, yes.
Ok.
What  ?
A sweet Sader dinner with marror (horseradish bitter-herb) && hard-boiled egg?
Sounds interesting.
Did you have some challah ?
Hopefully not too many plagues. Saders would be better.
Yes, Darjee && I each ate a bit of challah.  üòä 
Sweet.
I miss it.
This past week was nearly breadless.
Do you want to review your calorie && movie budgets?
I do.
But probably later.
Okay.
What are your plans for this coming week ?
Well to try to stock more food && re-learn how to ask God questions, if doing so is fruitful.
How about you?
I don't want to talk about it.
):
üòû
But thank you for asking.
Actually ...
I fully expect this coming week
to be nothing short of:
fabulous !!
Are you planning on
another excursion to Madison ?
Probably not again for quite a while.
Why not ?
Don't those games go every week ?
Yes, but there are better reasons to stay home for now.
Oh yes.
What was I thinking ?!!
Just (slightly) unconscious there
for a moment.
I frequently forget about
the c-19 thing.
lol
Cancel that last question please.
I'll re-ask it again in August.
üòä
Sounds good.  üòä 
Well do you have anything else on your PCA for tonight?
I do.
Is there a chance that we
can continue this tomorrow
evening ?
Yes.
Let's.
Sounds like a plan.
Thank you for this one.
üòä
Thank you as well.  üòä 
I ‚ù§ you Pip.
You're welcome.
I ‚ù§ you Dad.
You and Darjee have a good snooze.
You too.
Thank you.  I will.
And we'll redo on Sat Apr 4 2020
at 2000 G / 1900 P ?
Yep.
Ah yes.
April 4th.
Another anniversary.
56 years.
Well -- goodnight then My Lord.
üòä
GoodNight Dad.

How has your Sabbath wrapped up dear Dad?
Goood Evening Philip.
Good Evening.
How was your Saturday ?
üòä
It ain't "wrapped up" yet.
I get to chat with Pip
-- before it wraps !!
I ‚ù§ you Philip.
It was mostly gr8, but I've been more pensive than usual, contempl8ing the existence of G-d, the ramific8ions, how to seek to know Him more earnestly, whether it might be adversarial or better to be allies, whether servant is better than slave... a lot of weird stuff to mastic8.
I ‚ù§ you too Dad.
Xcellent !    Xcellent !!     Xcellent !!!  
Pensive is good.
Contempl8ing is good.
Mastic8ing is good.
You are good.
No.
Scratch that.
You are grreat !!
üòä
I've also upd8d some Octology code which gener8s 3 differently sized crosses. The first in the upper-right is just the crux showing the section mapping (which you can see a minimal version of under the "Precursor"). Lower-right shows the word blocks fit to my default 160x50 terminals, && the lower-left fits just about all 1400 8-words within a 240x67 terminal. What do you think of any of it?
https://github.com/pip/Octology/raw/master/gfx/sho/Octology-cros-shot_3840x2160-K44MHuBF.png
Hmm.
It's not loading.
Let me try again.
BBS
Hopefully these can be crosses as symbols of life rather than death.
Nope.   
I just get an  x  in a box.
Sup ?
Hmm. Let's try a similar but different route.
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pip/Octology/master/gfx/sho/Octology-cros-shot_3840x2160-K44MHuBF.png
Ok.
10q
Nope.
samesame
Can you see HTTPS://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology ?
It should also be linked at the bottom of that page.
HOP
(Hold on please.)
Take your time.
w8ing is a gift, so: Thank you.  üòâ
Yer wLcome.
I think I've got a CPU usage
problem.  I know how to
fix it -- but is time-intensive.
Why don't you tell me
about what you added --
but please use words I
can understand.
üòä
Well if you've seen the huge list of 8-words in my Octology ~/dox/2du/8.utf file && look for the yellow letters in the upper-left of the screenshot you can see the primary groups of pre-cursor letters to the 8 in their words, so I've arranged the groups by size && color into a 3x3 grid of the terminal.
Ok.  That is clear.
Thank you.
I've added the stretching of the r8 block to nest into the crux more widely in the lower-left screen.
GOP
Ok.
Why "more widely" ?
To fit more prefixes into the space available.
Ok.
Got it.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
If you see the 7x5 block of colored letters along the left side of the upper-right screen (starting "IVLvNUP") that is the core crux of my crosses of light && life.
It's exploded in the center, with smooshed up words attempting to highlight the letter of their block && directionality when possible.
Then the blocks expand into the big list of words to pack in mostly prefixes.
So you can see along the right side of the lower-right screen the r8 block starts with "c f g i o p t u ..." because crate, freight, gate, irate, orate, prate, trait, && urate are the first smallest words sorted into that block.
Does it start making some sense to you, or do you have any questions?
I do have Qs -- yes.
But first --
I have goood gnus.
Goood! What is it?  üòä
I believe I have it on-screen now.
üòä
Yaaa !!
Sat Apr    4  17:56:14
Is that it ?
Sorry. I got confused. Is the date in the shot your goood news?

Here's what I've got.
Is that it ?
Yep. That's the result of my upd8s to `8plc`, my "8-Pre-Cursor Letter Counter".
Good.
But --
Other than that "dateline"
-- everything else is too
small to read.
What is the secret ?
Zoom functionality, like maybe Control-Equals or Control-Shift-Equals in most browsers.
Or open it in an image-editor where there's more likely fine control of scaling.
Hold please.
Trying 'em.
Happy  to hold.
I had tried Plan B
several minutes ago.
No avail.
Zoomup there makes a mess
of un-read-ability.
Trying Plan A now.
BBS
Ah ha.
That works great.
Very clean.
Very readable.
Thank you.
Now.
You're welcome.
Point me to things please.
Thanks for checking out my latest results.
The crux mainly maps the 35 pre-cursor letters into a 7x5 block emphasized largest in the upper-right screen.
Traveling to upper-right ...
Then the blocks are built around the crux in the lower-right && made to fit almost all words in the lower-left.
W8 please.
Ok.  I'm at U.R. area.
Tell me what I'm looking at please.
Well the very top-right of the upper-right screen shows total character counts throughout the entire 8.utf file (the list of which extends a good bit above what's shown).
Then the left side shows 3 Pre-cursor Letter block arrangements. The one near the middle of the left side is the main 7x5 which is expanded upon in the center.
In very UR -- I see    7AJ,
Are we together ?
Yep.
I'm there now too.
-- preceded by       29,331:
7AJ is a base-64 number-string which expands into the decimal 29,331 which is just before it, yeah.
What is this telling me please ?
2 equivalent ways to represent the same number.
But what does this do for me
The number is the count of the character 'a' throughout the entire 8.utf file.
-- a regular person ?
No person.
The letter 'a' appears that many time in the whole file.
s/time/times/;
And why is that important
to a non-programmer ?
It's useful for knowing the frequency of occurrences. It's not important to a non-programmer really... yet. Maybe someday it will be though.
Those character counts are not as important (even to programmers) as the crux map which follows them.
Good.
Where is the "crux map" ?
I'm still at UR.
It starts in the upper-right screen with the Magenta "Precursor" then Yellow "Letters" && it ends with "MountMovMnt".
Ok.
Hold please.
Good.
Ok.
I see those 16 lines.
Now.  Help me here Pip.
Look at it with my eyes --
and tell me what it
communicates to me please.
I don't know the first thing about looking at anything with your eyes. It probably communic8s a meaningless mash-up of few discernible real words in too many colors with few patterns that stand out to you?
You were wrong.
You did look at it with my eyes.
And described it precisely !!
When you and I chat --
you tell me things.
You teach me.
You send me mental picture.
You enhance my life.
You fill my "how" basket.
How does Octology also
do those kinds of things
The key is the 7x5 block beside the "gospels.net" in the background. It is expanded into the 15 lines in the center, where each letter appears again with space to include some directional words using those letters (in the same colors).
for me ?
Octology might do better things for you if you get to run it yourself someday. You'll probably just need to install CygWin && a few dependencies before it almost all of it should be able to be run locally there.
Yes, how does Octology also do those kinds of things for you?
Am I to answer that one --
or are you going to answer it
for me ?
Oh, I don't know.
I'll accept that.
Thank you.
Thank you too.
You're welcome Pip.
Can we go to an associated topic ?
Sure.
You mentioned the "gospels.net".
Comments follow.
You sent me 2 assignments

Now ...
Cool. Thanks for checking those out.
Can we talk about #1 ?
What did you think of Bret and Heather ?
I've read through the Gospel of Philip once so far, but would like to rE-rEad it again soon.
Yeah, I really appreC8 Bret && Heather sharing their advice && encouragement && answering pressing questions, providing some good guidance.
Put you at peace a bit ?
Did they ?
Yes. For you some too?
No. 
I live in peas.
Oh, right.
A wonderful vegetable !!
4 things -- every human being

I will respond to your
comment -- before going

Good for you Pip.
Cool. Didn't mean to de-rail you, but hopefully we can get back on your original track shortly.
I know I keep telling you
this -- but you need to hear
it over & over:
You are on track -- on
course -- you are perfect
Pip.
----------------------
Ok.
Thank you for thinking && saying so. It's true that I retain a flawed image of myself, but maybe I need to do more mirror work too, eh?
Abs  sew  root  Lee  !!
And -- you're welcome.
Jus callin em as eye sea em.
And I see you on the mountaintops.
Maybe not there yet.
But constantly climbing.

You wanna complete that one ?
Peace.
Whirled peas.
You got it Honey !!
Whirled peas.
FTR's 21-year goal.
Are the number in that order
for a reason.
Possibly.
But -- if so -- I am
not privy to that reason.
Most of us
live without much of
any one of them
most of the time.
However --
It is rather interesting
that -- if we "focus" (Pc#28)
on the "odd" 2 --
the "even" 2 --
just kinda follow along
on their own.
(//)
I see. That's goood.
Nope.
Sorry.
Scratch that.
Numbers wrong.
Permiso to redo please ?
Yes.
Thank you.
Correction follows.
If we focus on the first 2
-- the last 2 just
follow on their own.
Yes.
Now we've got it.
You understand ?
Let me go over it a bit more. I'll get it.
I'll help here.
We need not chase either
Health, nor Fulfillment.
If we search after Peace & Happiness
-- Health & Fulfillment
MUST follow.
Gotta.
(//)
Sense makes ?
Yes.
Thank you.
Good.
You're a smart guy.
Almost as smart as Ange !!
Sometimes. Maybe often.
I don't know about that. She could be somewhat far from me either way, sometimes.
Whatever you say My Lord.
You're de boss.
I could easily be wrong. Maybe I trail her almost always pretty close.
I wonder how well you or I know her at all recently to judge, or anticip8 from extrapol8ion or whatever.
"lord"  means  "boss"
"Lord" is the 14th most
frequent word in The Bible.
That seems like an obscure thing to know. I'm glad you do though.
What ?
Angie's geniosity --
The most frequent words in the Bible.
or the "lord" freq ?
Yeah.
No.
Actually not.
About 28 years ago -- before the
web really got rolling --
I wanted a good software
So do you commune with your Father G-d L-rd in Heaven through His Holy Spirit every day?
version of a Bible concordance.
Found none that suited me.
So -- I wrote my own.
Learned a lot of stuff.
Word frequencies among them.
-----------------------
Nice. Does it run on GNU/Linux, or only MicroSoft Windows so far?
Neither.
Wrote it in DOS.
Using "BASIC".
Ah. Have you run it recently?
Yep.
Use it (at least) once a week.
Often oftener.
Right on! Is there a chance you could please share a copy of the source with me sometime? I haven't examined any BASIC in years.
I'll think about that.
There are probably tons
of much better concordance
programs out there now.
I last tweaked mine in
January of 2001.
I had to stop developing
it -- because BASIC has
a "bytes cap" of
about 74,000.
So -- a number of enhancements
that I had hoped to include
-- had to be waived.
It works.
And I use it.
Cool. Nice work.  üòä 
But it's not exquisite.
And -- exquisite Xcellence
is always my target --
in everything !!
Thank you Pip.
You're welcome Dad.
Even though you've spent your life in service of G-d, is He still so vast that you cannot know Him well?
What a great question Philip !!
Let me go get something you
said a bit earlier this evening.
BBS
Okay.
Here it is.
Wow.
It was in the first couple
of minutes of this chat.
You said:
It was mostly gr8, but I've been more pensive than usual, contempl8ing the existence of G-d, the ramific8ions, how to seek to know Him more earnestly, whether it might be adversarial or better to be allies, whether servant is better than slave... a lot of weird stuff to mastic8.
And (in there) were a number
of things that I could have
commented on.  And now
(I think) is the time.
Just now you asked:
Even though you've spent your life in service of G-d, is He still so vast that you cannot know Him well?
These 2 tie together.
" ... whether servant is better than slave ... "
-- in the first one.
" ... in service of God ... "
-- in the second one.
Let me see if I can shed
a little light on this
relationship.
We     do not     serve God.
This is a confusing area.
We do.
But -- in the way that
most people think of it
-- we don't.
You see.  When most people
use the word "God" -- they
are essentially thinking of
"The Father".
And -- we (most assuredly)
are not supposed to attempt
to serve Our Father.
That is not "the design" --
and not (at all) what He
wants.
There are 3 persons in
The Trinity.  All 3 are
(equally) God.  But
each of the 3 have
a set of primary
"job descriptions".
And The Father (Person #1)
is to serve us !!
And we -- are Person #2.
Now -- that's the first part.
The part that we do not
serve God (The Father).
God (The Father)
serves us.
Now.  Let's get to
the 2nd part.  The
part where we (the 2nd Person)
do serve God.
Do we serve #1 (The Father) ?
No.
Do we serve #3 (Sis) ?
No.
So then.
There is only one more left.
Do we serve #2 ?
Yep.
And who is the 2nd Person
of God ?
Answer is:
Christ.
And what is the definition of
Christ ?
God -- in a
skinsuit.
You are Christ.
Angie is Christ.
Mom is Christ.
Katy is Christ.
Mandy is Christ.
I believe you get the idea.
I don't have to name them all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That is who we are to serve.
God -- in the blllions
of his (and her) skinsuits.
Yes.  I am not done here.
But -- shall pause for
comment(s) or question(s).
(//)
None right now.
Ok.
I continue.
That (above) addressed the
first one.
Now -- let's address the
2nd one  :::
Even though you've spent your life in service of G-d, is He still so vast that you cannot know Him well?
We'll ignor the section "A" of that
-- as we just covered that.
And I'll respond to the section "B" of it:
" Is He still so vast that you cannot know Him well? "
He will always be "that" vast.
Always.
That's one of the most
wonderful things about Him.
He is depthless.
Or -- more accurately:
bottomless.
Unsearchably depthful !!
Now -- let's get at the
"know Him well" part.
The word "know" is used in
many different ways.  But --
is common-day (normal)
usage -- it is not a very
strong "knowery" that we
customarily mean when we
use the word "know".
However.
The original meaning of
the word "know" -- and the
meaning that we are
usually to hold -- when
encountering it in
Scripture is:
"to be (or become) one with".
So.
Knowing God
is actually about
becoming Him.
And that is what He
wants for each one
of us.
To "walk" Him.
Here on earth.
The Father has
no legs.
Sounds like a serious challenge.
He is entirely spirit.
No body.
No legs.
We (the 2nd person
of God) are the legs
of our Father.
His job is to teach us
How to walk Him.
How to talk Him.
How to do Him.
How to be Him.
If the 1st-person Father is purely spirit, can He be identifiable enough to discern that it's really Him && not some impostor attempting to interact with the Son or Holy Ghost?
Yeshua didn't come
here (primarily) to do
the "Easter" thing.
That was just a "side job".
He came to show us how
to BE God.
Walking, talking, doing, being.
Ok enuff on that for now.
I see you have asked
another Q.
If the 1st-person Father is purely spirit, can He be identifiable enough to discern that it's really Him && not some impostor attempting to interact with the Son or Holy Ghost?
Great question !!
It would be gr8 if Y'shua could have a much less painful re-enactment of the walking among && teaching that occurred through his Earthly ministry those thousands of years ago around 0 C.E..
Let's let Sis (the Holy Ghost)
out of this casserole for now.
She is a whole 'nother lesson.
The simple answer to your
question is:
Yeah. Sorry I've not pre-scripted these questions well enough to isol8 complexities && such.
Yes -- there are plenty of
"imposter" spirits.
You're typing.
Go ahead on.
Doesn't the living Son of God or man have at least physical manifest8ion that can be contextualized within the world in ways that purely spirit cannot authentic8 with? I'm not sure why not though, if they know how to make impacts that they intend for.
What do you think ?
I think: "Possibly?"
Good answer.
Want to go on ?
Maybe the billions of God's children are those who are all 3: God, skin-suit, && spirit I guess?
We can go on.
You stuck a "?" at the end
of that -- but -- It more
(to me) sounded
like a comment.
Yeah, it didn't end up phrased as a question really, but was rather inflection about an uncertain sentence conclusion.
Say a bit more please.
If God creates && sustains life && humans are His kids, then we live physically, as Gods as well (yet limited by material), then we may have spirit or soul in addition which is another thing to become trustworthy when interwoven among living God-beings.
You have that (whole thing)
pretty well (masterfully)
nailed down.  Excellent Pip.
Thank you.
I'd just like to throw in
a couple of tweaks.
You're welcome son.
Okay.
You said:
"we may have spirit or soul in addition"
These 2 words are nearly
universally confused.
Even our dictionaries add
to this confusion -- instead of
I could have meant "... spirit &&/or soul ..." to suggest either or both.
clearing it up -- as they are
supposed to.  But --
I need not say more on the
lexicography here.
Let's get into the
"spirit / soul" thing.
Okay.
You do not "have" a spirit.
You are a spirit.
You are the spirit
which created the universe.
And that spirit's name
is God.
You are God.
We can do much more
on the subject of spirits
Well a sometimes constrained meat-sack version of that spirit though, when we can do much less, I think.
(probably at another time)
-- but now let's address
the word: "soul".
I do not have a definition
for the word "soul".
I hold one in my head.
But I do not normally share it
-- or write it down.  Because
-- over the years -- as I
have asked My Father for
a definition of the word
"soul" -- He has always
declined to give it to me.
He says:
Hmm. Sounds familiar somewhat.
I have given you 2 Axioms
-- both of which have that word
in them.  And -- I shall leave it
to you -- to see if you can see
-- what you are searching for
in your question.
(//)
What are the 2 Axiom mentions?
15 and 16.
Do you have those ?
Those would fill in a gap for me, so I'd have from 14 through 19 after those.
Oh     gap     gap     gap   
Here they come.
Get ready to copy please.
--------------------------------------
Axiom #15:
I own but one thing:  this moment in time
with God, and therein lies my soul.
Axiom #15.
-------------------------------
Axiom #16:
Copied 15.
Save my soul, I own nothing, but am only
temporary custodian of that which I am
touching at the moment.
Axiom #16.
--------------------------
Just one thing I would like to
Thanks.
point out (in #16) --
The word "save" means:
"with the exception of".
-----------------------
You're welcome.
If a soul can scarcely be described, how can it be a something which can claim ownership of more than a little something when stripped of all but touching? Not sure if I could word that right.
Figures.
üòä
Not sure I understand it either.
Want to re-word it ?
Heh... not as much.  üòâ
lol
Maybe a soul that was more substantial in a personal form would be the claim to ownership more than purely ephemeral as I imagine it. Would you think so too?
Not a clue.
Let me tell you a short story.
Permiso ?
Yep.
Ok.
Thank you.
Story follows.
The Axioms are about 37
years old.  At least -- from
the time that I received them.
I have been chewing on them
for that long.  And using
them in my life -- to the
best of my ability to do so.
Have I got them all milked-out
yet ?  I'm sure not.
But -- if you would like to
If you're the most 1st-person God the Father-like human father alive, does that mainly align your walk && soul with His so speaking in any manner with you is akin to speaking to Him pretty closely?
chew on 15 & 16 -- and
bring up this "soul" thing
again in 2057 -- I think
I'd be fine with that.
(end-of-story)
(//)
I mainly think of fantasy "Soul Calibur", my favorite video-game franchise, as a main word-assoC8ion, not necessarily spiritual but still leaning meta-physical somewhat.
Thank you for that story && for sharing 15 && 16 with me there.
You are very welcome Pip.
My pleasure.
I ‚ù§ stories.
I ‚ù§ stories too.
üòä
Ok.
Another question.
You said:
If you're the most 1st-person God the Father-like human father alive, does that mainly align your walk && soul with His so speaking in any manner with you is akin to speaking to Him pretty closely?
I think I know what you're
getting at there -- but could you
please re-ask it in 15 words
or less -- and without the
Fair. Are you the living God the Father?
leading "if" clause ?
Are you asking if I am
God The Father ?
Are you Him, the One who sent his Son to die yet live?
Tough question.
But a (very) good one.
Let me see if I can do this.
How are you to "see" me ?
That one is easy.
You are to see me as
your brother.
Video-chat while we do whatever.
You are Christ.
I am Christ.
Christ may be thought of
as "a body".  Albeit --
Why don't you prefer Moshiach to "Christ"?
a non-physical body.
But still a body.  A "spiritual" body.
So.  We (you and I) are
one body.  But each of us
are members (parts, if you wish)
of the same one body.
And that body is:  Christ.
(God, showing up on earth
in the billions of skinsuits.)
However.
Having said that -- I now
shall add -- I and My Father
are one.  Not one person.
But nevertheless -- one spirit.
One God.
Let's ask again.
Am I "Gerry Stuart"
(Pip's earthy Dad)
God The Father ?
If God && man can both seem capricious on limited time-scales, how can there be confidence in one spirit, even if already not one person, but still maybe of the same Messiah body?
Technically -- no.
However -- you will see
similarities between us which
will make it almost impossible
to know with whom you are
communicating.  And --
2 more things about that:
(1)   I am more like Him today
        than I was yesterday
        -- and that growth
        never stops.
(2)   Also -- what I have
I'm also curious about what the anointing with olive-oil does, even just symbolically or traditionally. Significance?
        with Him -- is what
        He also want you to
        have with Him too.
The bottom line (and a very
funny thing to imagine too)
is that his desire is that
all of His children become
so-like-Him -- that none
of us will know if the "person"
in front of us is just a regular
human -- or actually The Father
speaking (and acting) through
what seems to be:
That's powerful. 
a tent of flesh.
(//)
Yep.
Tis indeed.
Now ...
Thank you both!
We both say:
You're welcome -- My Brother.
You're welcome -- My Son.
While I was answering that one
Is it okay if I'm more the body && flesh of Messiah rather than "Christ", or do I need to embrace both terms to be proper Brother && Son, my Lord?
-- you slipped in 1 comments -- and
3 more questions.
And now -- here is a 4th question too.
lol
Which do you wish I should
respond to first My Lord ?
Any or none. I can w8.
(//)
Ok.
Thank you.
We'll tackle the last first.
Is it okay if I'm more the body && flesh of Messiah rather than "Christ", or do I need to embrace both terms to be proper Brother && Son, my Lord?
Proposal: Point-of-Light #13 should have a selah caesura appended to it. Thoughts?
Sorry.  Had to reload Gmail
-- a number of times.
No worry.
Is it okay if I'm more the body && flesh of Messiah rather than "Christ", or do I need to embrace both terms to be proper Brother && Son, my Lord?
Moshiach
Messiah
Christ
-- all synonyms.
All same-same.
Distinct connot8ions at least?
Which used -- doesn't matter.
No distinctions.
Just language.
Maybe there shouldn't be, but in some ways I think there still are.
Ok.
Tell me please.
There has been considerable thought as I gleaned it that Y'shua was preaching to Hebrews but it was Rav' Sha'ul (Paul, the ex-Pharisee I think) who broadened the message to the gentile as well.
Maybe that's kinda irrelevant.
Christ assoC8s much more closely with historical Catholicism && modern Christianity, which would appear rather starkly distinct adjacent a Messianic Jewish Synagogue, to me.
Maybe it's a mountain out of mole-hills, but I think the tradition from which each concept && manifest8ion sprang was somewhat unique, but I wasn't there back then, so who knows?!
I understand what you say
-- I think.
Here is my story.
Why do I prefer -- and nearly 
exclusively -- use the word 
"Christ" ?
Understandability -- for my listeners.
Many non-Jewish will not "get it" --
if I use the Hebrewish terms.
But (usually) ALL Hebrew speakers
-- understand that the word
"Christ" means Messiah -- or
Moshiach.
(//)
I think you're sacrificing some precious authenticity by pronouncing Greek rather than Hebrew, but maybe it's negligible.
You are correct.
The "authenticity" is missing.
However -- there are a large
block of people who
Or maybe regard for the force the original words in context had?
are not familiar with much
of the Old Testament
at all.  And I do not wish
to "lose them" when
I speak.
Fair enough. I don't really understand how to measure for the broadest audience like you must.
Maybe you'll have advanced seminars where you worry less about losing them.
When we do Seminars in
The San Fernando Valley --
Ah. We.
or New York City -- I may
(very well) change my
terms.
Yes.
We.
I the beginning times --
you will still be in
Will Angie join us maybe?
Osh.  But -- down the road
-- this will not always be
the case.
Angie will not join us ever!
Unless ...
something else occurs
first.
(//)
Not in SFValley to see a Seminar or say "Hi!"?
When was the last time she
came to Oshkosh to say
"Hi" to you ?
She hasn't visited since I've had to move down here from Appleton, unless I'm forgetting an early time after 2015.
Ok.
So what makes you think
she would travel from Missouri
to California to say
Hi to you ?
Because she could visit Tim && Manders && kids mainly but could say "Whassup?" to me && get to know you a bit. She had some interest in visiting you together back when I'd query her about the prospect.
In 1996 -- you told me that
Angie wanted to come
(with you) to see me.
You did not come.
She did not come.
No.
She indic8d that she might be interested, if we put a plan together.
I take that back.
You did come --
in 2007.
But she has not
come yet.
I've wanted to visit again since 2007, but haven't been able to at all recently.
And -- I do not expect
her to change her mind.
I have no issue with
our 13-year interval.
You and I are fine.
I haven't come to
see you in 13 years
either.
True dat!
Changes are coming.
We've stayed in pretty close touch via GMail I'd say, thankfully.
In fact -- they are here.
We are (living) already
in them.
For joy !!    For joy !!   
It's all you Pip.
Rejoice!  üòä
You wanted weekly chats.
You asked me for them.
I said yes.
All your fault Pip.
üòä
Indeed. Blame me.  üòâ
lol
So have you been watching on average a good movie each day?
I wouldn't guarantee that
they are always "good".
But -- that is part of my
verrrrrry lonnnng report
which is cued up
here on the shipping dock.
You'll get it --
when you command it.
(//)
You know how you said last night that your Father gave you His glasses to see through divorce... well can you also use them to see out of my glasses sometimes too?
Not sure what you mean.
Help ?
Me either. Was just thinking that maybe pairs of eye-glasses can become like quantum-entangled with each other && each display what the other sees instead, or something. Maybe the shared body of Christ can cover that with many bodies making up the whole. Hmm.
Hmm back atchah.
You are typing.
Are you familiar with the word: "Yate"?
Nope.
Wanna share ?
Searches hardly have results but I've found it to be an obsolete form of "Gate".
Ok.
It is also a Spanish word.
Just interested me a bit. It's the only 8-word I've encountered with a "y" before the "ate". Ah... "yah-tey" too.
Also a kind of eucalyptus tree.
Nice.
Smells good -- anyway.
üòä
Is that what pandas mostly eat?
more Gmail problems
Sorry.
It's okay.
Hopefully it will improve soon.
It's perfect !!
Is that what pandas mostly eat?
Eye doan no.
'Aven't scene a panda in
Pennsylvania in quite a while.
Well.
Are you going to command
a report soon ?
I was content to w8 longer, but please produce it now, if you'd like to.
lol
I can w8.
mmm mmm  mmm  mmm mmm mmmm
You like my song ?
Hard to make out the rhythm or melody, but sure... it's a nice song there.  üòâ
‚ô´ mmm  mmmmm  mmmmmm ‚ô´  mmm  mmmm ‚ô´
Is that better ?
A bit. It's probably Chicago.
It is !!
I'm impressed.
"A Hard Habit To Break"
-- is the name of it.
Very GOOD Pip.
Alright.
The w8 is over.
Thee Report cometh.

++++++++++++++++++++
This is the Report on the results
of the "5-Point" Plan from last
Friday's Chat (March 27 2020).
First -- here is the entire Plan.

I shall now report on how we did
on each Point of the Plan.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
(Report on "The Plan", Point #1)
(1)   Even though "I don't feel like it" 
        I will spend (at least) 1 hour
        on the TNP-2002 letter --
        before putting Pip's Pappy
        into the crib tonight.
Of course -- this was a very wise 
affirmation that you gave to me 
on this matter, Philip.
It uses the age-old maxim:
                       Just Start It

And I did.  And -- as the "doing"
(then) produces an internal "juice"
-- the doer finds himself both
energized and enthused -- amidst 
the rushes within.  And when the
proposed "at-least" has expired --
the spirit (the doer's inclination) 
(his fire) (his leaning) toward the 
project -- can not easily be extinguished.
And thereby -- he proceeds on -- in it.
Thank you for your wisdom in this Philip.
You're totally welcome Dad.
üòä
And as you knew it would -- my "1-hour" 
turned into 5.2 hours.  And even besides 
the vast accomplishment -- I was also
fervently filled with joy throughout it.
I love you Son.
‚ù§
(End of Report on "The Plan", Point #1)
I love you Dad.  ‚ù§ 
Thank you so much.
Warms my heart.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
(Report on "The Plan", Point #2)
(2)   I will hang 1 "I like myself"
        before hitting the sack
        -- and a dozen (or so) more
        after sunup on Saturday (28)
        morning.
I DID hang 1 "ILM" poster 
before hitting the sack on 
Saturday morning March 28 2020.
It wasn't fancy (or pretty).  
Not yet done on Tera.
Just hand lettered.
But -- it got the message across.
             Which was its purpp.
Good.
Thank you.
Then -- Saturday night -- I crafted
2 "night screens" for myself -- on
Tera -- which I have been using ever
since (during my snooze-times).
     I believe I have mentioned 
     my "night-screens" before. 
As I am in bed -- I happen to be facing
Tera's screen.  So -- my night-screens
always make my last vision before sleep
-- and my first (after): whatever I have
decided to display there.
Here are they -- which are also the same
as the ones that I "papered" for posting
on the all of my every walls:


By the end of the weekend 
(Sunday night) I had another 
7 up -- in the bathroom & kitchen.
And then -- on Monday (03-30-20) -- I 
completely plastered all of the other
"ILM" posters -- in the office/bedroom,
and the "dining" area (which is majorly
used as an "open-closet") making a grand 
total of 17 "I Like Myself" posters --
throughout my 396-square-foot apartment.
It is now impossible to be anywhere in 
my "Franklin Street Homestead" -- if you
are (a) conscious, and (b) have your lids 
up -- and fail to see (at least) 1 "ILM"
poster somewhere.
Of course -- for the specific sake of the
2 (former) "recent-year struggles" in the
27,998-day "breathery history" of Pip's 
Dad -- we have hung an appropriate:
‚Ä¢  "I Like Myself" above the refrigerator
‚Ä¢  "I Like Myself" above Tera's screen
So.   As: it it not possible to WATCH
         a movie without one's eyes open 
         -- there is (now) NO EXCUSE for 
         a failure to please Katy in that 
         department.
And.  Since: the (normal) prepar8ion involved
          -- for shoveling vittles into one's 
          frontal cranial orifice -- is rarely
          attempted without one's eyes open -- 
          any failing(s) in the "Eating As Josh" 
          arena -- should also be considered to 
          only be possible -- IF -- Pip's Dad is
          in a state of ambulansque dormitet.

                      (it's Latin)
(End of Report on "The Plan", Point #2)
Thank you.
You're welcome Pip.
All your fault.
You made me do it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
(Report on "The Plan", Point #3)
(3)   I will eat as Josh -- and make
       Pip & Katy & me happy.

Xcellent.
As you can see in the EAJ Report --
according to the numbers -- I was 
"liking myself" quite well this week.
Thank you.
However.  I must also (needs to) add
that:  I DID have one "dip" in my
"resolve" on Monday morning. 
You're welcome. Good to see you on-track.
Yes.  I agree.
I could not hold myself to make 
  it a "fast" day -- as is my usual 
  (Monday) do.
            Yet.  I DID do it on Tuesday.
       And so.  For that.  I LIKE MYSELF.
 
(End of Report on "The Plan", Point #3)
Thank you for that Report on Point #3.
You're welcome.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
(Report on "The Plan", Point #4)
(4)   I will hold my movie watching
        to 1 per day -- for the next
        21 days.
I have done this now for 8 days in a row
(Sat Mar 28 through Sat Apr 04 2020).
And -- on Tuesday (March 31) it wasn't
even a "1".  It was a "0".  So:
                I LIKE MYSELF.
And -- it's all your fault too.
Gr8!
Thank you Pip.
You're welcome Dad.
I'm smiling too.

(Report on "The Plan", Point #5)
(5)   I will like myself -- especially
        because my behavior warrants it.
I did this this week.
And I thank you so much -- for both your
concern and your support.  You are a very
wise, loving, and cherished mentor, Pip.
And I am so fortunate to have you.
                 Blessed. 
Aww. You're welcome Dad. I'm blessed to have you too.
I believe David would have said:
"My cup runneth over!"
(Ps 23:5c)
             I LIKE MYSELF.

And -- this past week -- my 
behavior quite warranted it!
             Thank you My Lord.

Note on the "Tue Mar 31 2020" do.
I have 2 major bills:
     ‚Ä¢  rent
     ‚Ä¢  ISP
Although they are monthly obligations
-- I pay them semi-annually.  It's just
easier.  And -- this past Tuesday (31)
was when I did that -- along with a few
minor financials too.

Ready for a little comment ?
Yep.
Ok.
Here comes
Don't believe everything 
  you find on the web.
It ain't all accurate.
Like the C-19 stuff.
What's open & what's closed.
Libraries closed ?  Yes.  They are.
Banks open ?  Many are.  But mine snot!
Although I use my debit card for 
more than 95% of my purchases --
I DO use cash for some (occasionally).
And how/where do get the greenbacks ?
I go to my bank for 'em.
            I haven't used an ATM 
               for nearly 30 years.
But as of today -- after finding 
out that my bank branch is latched
-- looks like that is going to change.
            Se la vie.
        All is perfect.
          Piece 5b
üòä
Are those equivalent? No accidents means all perfect?
Yep.
Basically -- yes.
They come from the same source.
Romans 8:28.
But -- when we do "the lesson"
on each one -- the emphasis
is different.
But yes.
You're right.
The sentiments are
equivalent.
Very good Pip.
All being perfect seems to have much wider ramific8ions to me than there merely being no accidents, but maybe they're sides of the same coin.
Well -- now you've done it !!
Do I hafta launch into a
mini-lesson on each one ?
Naa.
Sure.
Or not.
I need a bathroom break.
I think not.
Be Back in a Bit.
Take your bathroom break.
Take your time.
I'll think about what I
want to say here.
Ok.
I've thunk it over.
I believe I'll let the
text of those 2 lessons
w8 for another time.
But -- I will just say that
everything is (totally) in
Father's Hand.
Nothing happens without
His finger being in it.
Nothing.
Ever.
(//)
Back.
Me too.
There's the "perfect / no accident" thing.
Sufficient for now ?
Yeah.
Good.
Anything else on your PCA
for this evening ?
Not for now.
Aren't you going to ask me too ?
Yes.
Anything else on your PCA for tonight?
Yes.
Thank you for asking.
üòä
I saved the "light" one
for the "closer".
Ready ?
Yup.
Permiso ?
Thank you.
Here comes.
Last night (2301G/2201P) -- I mentioned
that today (Sat Apr 4 2020) would be a
56-year anniversary.
Well -- that's not accurate -- 
on the dates.
Off by one day.
I wrote this on Saturday.
Got it.
Expecting that I would be
sharing in with you (also)
on Saturday.
But -- as you just said:
you "got" it.
So -- I'll continue (as if Sat).
Yep.  Something happened exactly 2922
weeks ago (20,454 days) on Saturday,
April 4th, 1964 -- which had never
happened before.
And it's highly (HIGHLY!) unlikely
-- that it will EVER happen again.

Those Fabulous Four from Liverpool
-- had ALL 5 of the chart-topping
songs on the American Hot 100.
                And not only that.

The Beatles also had 7 other songs 
peppering the Hot 100 chart --
making a whopping 12 Beatles songs 
on that week‚Äôs Hot 100 !!
                     Plus ...
Wow! What champions.

That same week -- The Beatles also 
held the top two slots on Billboard‚Äôs 
albums chart:

Neither of these 2 U.S. chart 
records have ever been broken.
-----------------------------------------
How big were The Beatles ?
Hmm.  Not sure I can actually answer that.
But -- to give you an idea ...
let's try another question.
The Beatles first came to America
in February of 1964 -- 56 years ere.
          And here is the question 
          with an incredible answer:
       How big are the Beatles today ?
         Wikipedia recently did a 
"Topics Most Frequently Requested"
                      report.
The list was of the top 1000.
#2 through #5 had very strong numbers.
But -- the frequency of #1 was
3 TIMES the frequency of #2!
                           3 TIMES !!!
And #1 was  (of course)  THE BEATLES.

                       (applause please goes here)
Applause!!
             Thank you.               Thank you very much.
Well should we about call it bed-time?
No.
Not bed time.
lol
My mommy said that
9 o'clock is my bedtime.
So.
We must have nearly
7 hours to go yet --
before I have to go
to bed.
What would you like to
do before bedtime ?
Nothing else I can think of right away.
How 'bout some roller sk8ing.
I haven't been for a while.
Or -- is the SA
or PNS still open.
About 1:20 am there -- right ?
All 3 probably closed for most of the time until 9am, yeah.
Oh well.
All is perfect.
So.
Thank you for this great chat Pip.
I ‚ù§ you.
You're welcome Dad. Thank you too. I love you!  ‚ù§ 
Shall we do this again
Let's!
on the 10th ?
Yes.
'Sa date.
You are Darjee have plans
for later today ?
None yet.
/are/  /and/
Ok.
Hopefully catch some sun.
You'll thinka something.
Sun sounds good.
We have not really had more
than 1 or 2 "spring" days
in the past 6 weeks.
Still quite cold.
Makes me think I might
be in Minnesota again.
1958 was my last time there.
August.
Nice.
I'
Oops.
I'  ?
I've been to the twin cities several times.
And ?
I like it there too.
Was that when Mom was
schooling there ?
Once then && a couple times after.
Nice.
What did you do / see ?
Roger Waters with Lennon backup singers for the Wall Tour, && visiting a woman I was interested in at the time named Rabiha.
Ok.
Still in touch with her ?
Not at all since back then.
Was Waters any good ?
Heard she got happily married somewhere along the East-Coast.
Waters was awesome. Whole show was rad!
Haven't heard of him.
Pink Floyd.
Far out.
Yeah, Kippy && Pat Lennon && one of their brothers I don't really know && forget his name all sang backup && wore cool costumes as part of the show. Amazing visuals && physical wall construction && props && puppets && High-Def visualiz8ions. Gr8 experience.
Interesting.
He is a bassist.
Me too.
He looks like Richard Gere.
I can see that.
Neat.
Did Mom go with you ?
Yeah, && Rosie && Noah.
Sweet.
Rabiha too ?
I brought a little marijuana && puffed on it outside before the show started too. Got a little stoned for the start.
No Rabiha.
When was this ?
'94 ?
Probably 2012 or so.
Web says Jyly 2005 was last.
Is that wrong ?
/Jyly/  /July/
Pretty sure it was around 2011 or 2012.
Ok.
I'll go with your date.
Web gets stuff wrong
all the time.
Yep. Okay, well have a good rest of your night Dad. I'll look forward to chatting again on Friday.  üòä  ‚ù§ 
Yes -- I see it now.
Okay Pip.
‚ù§
üòä
Good night sweet son.
0'04-05-20 - 0239 Gtime / 0139 Ptime
0'04-19-20 - 2245 Gtime / 2145 Ptime (not stamped in chat with this, excerped from GChat at this time)
                                                                                              Yes, my questions.
                                                                                              In our previous chats, I seem to recall you indic8ing that you believed CoViD-19 might be a "Plan-B" of sorts by God as judgment for people who re-married. Maybe you only implied this though. Is that what you really think is occurring around the globe now, or how do you see the CoronaVirus? Have you tracked its stats at all?

I shall (first) offer a preface.  And then respond to your 2 questions   ¬∂   Preface:   Yes.  I did say "Plan-B".  ¬∂   Now -- as answer to the 2nd question:  No I have not tracked its stats at all.  Wondered -- yes.  Tracked -- no.   ¬∂   I pause here.  You may comment or "follow-up" question -- or I shall go on to the 1st question you asked.
(//)

                                                                                              FYI (For Your Inform8ion), JHU (Johns Hopkins University) has been collecting relevant d8a && making it available on GitHub, if you ever become interested. I also have several other sources I could share with you. Despite Pennsylvania having a much smaller popul8ion than California, it worryingly has thousands more confirmed cases (even if the death r8s remain similar at around 3.75% of confirmed cases presently).

Thank you.   ¬∂   I am not allowed to delve into the stats -- even though my natural mind does wonder about them   ¬∂   Another comment -- or I should go on to Q#1 ?
                                                                                              You're welcome. Why aren't you allowed to learn what's happening (regardless of your wonder)?
Great question Pip !!
Our "natural" mind is (sometimes) our friend.   Quite frequently not.  But sometimes -- it is.  ¬∂   You may remember that:  Piece #16 tells us that this 30,000-day time -- here on this earth -- is not "life" -- but is actually "Heaven-School".   ¬∂   And -- that there are only 2 courses in Heaven-School.  And both of them have very to do with:  "trading-in" our natural mind -- and replacing it with:  a new mind.   ¬∂   And how do we acquire that "new mind" ?
NDY
Not Done Yet
The new mind -- which we are to cultivate -- is the very mind of our Father.  We are to learn to "see" as He sees.  And think as He thinks.  And then:  go on to do as He does.  In short -- we are to become Him.
More to come.
                                                                                              How do you know any of this, with confidence or certainty or what?
But -- I pause for C or Q.
Another great question !!
Well -- for starters:  It's all over the Scriptures.
And -- secondarily -- He confirms it when I ask Him questions directly.
(//)
                                                                                              Can you please provide me references to the top few Scriptures that it's "all over"?
Sure.
                                                                                              Thank you.
Rom 12:2.  HTTPS://BibleHub.Com/romans/12.htm
Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will.

You want to look at that one on your own -- or I should send you a link ?
I am glad to look it up on my own, now or l8r. Saving locally in a chat log for future reference now.
https://biblehub.com/romans/12.htm
Thank you. Reading versions of 12:2 now.
This is probably a deeper "rabbit-hole" than we might both wish to tunnel down right now, but I really don't yet see how refusing to be conformed to this world enables one to instead be transformed by renewal of the mind. By what processes does any of this actually occur?
What ways must be refused? What transforms? What is renewed? How? In what ways? When? By what means? I don't get it.
It's ok.
I have others.  But I see 7 questions here.  I think it's still your turn.
Isn't renewal just like restor8ion or rejuven8ion but not transform8ive normally?
Yeah. There's a good 8 for you pick among. Whatever order you wish, me Lord.  üòâ 
Let's step back a moment.  Way back -- as a matter of fact.  And I shall now ask:  What (do you think) Our Father wants from us -- more than anything else ?
I don't believe any gods (or a single "God") exist in any meaningful sense, so it's nobody that wants nothing from us. Just our superstitions and fables and faith and delusions which persuade otherwise. We're simple-minded apes, by-and-large, grasping at straws for explan8ions regarding whatever we couldn't understand or were afraid to try to. Why should I see us (or "Him") differently?
Ok.  Let's set God aside -- for a moment.
Okay.
Another question.
Puedo ?
Yes, please proceed.
Good.  Thank you.  I will.
What (do you think) your (human) Dad wants from you -- more than anything else ?
(only one word)
Love?
Truth?
Trust?
All good words.
Attention?
But they are qualities (within you).
Respect?
No to "respect" too.
But "attention" is getting close.
We are looking for an actual "doing".
Not a characteristic or a quality.
A "doing" please.
I out of good guesses. Maybe please provide me a hint?
Sure.
Ooops. s/I out/I am out/;
What are we doing here -- now ?
Conversing?
Yep.
Is that not what all fathers and mothers want with their children -- more than anything else ?
Face-time.
Conversation -- is the answer.
#1.
I am quite sure many fathers and mothers do not want face-time or to converse with their children more than anything else.
Always !!
Ok.
I'm listening.
Maybe many do, under ideal circumstances, but at least I am an exception && many others seem to be as well.
What do you want from me -- more than anything else ?
Everything you could care to impart to me, equip me with, convey to me, open my eyes toward, etc..
The words "impart"  "equip"  "convey"  -- all sound pretty much like conversation to me.  Don't they to you ?
I want your love, truth, trust, attention, respect, affection, pride, wisdom, ... more than stuff that seems to be none of those.
Okay, yeah, partly. Hmm. Maybe you're right that those are transmitted through convers8ion.
But also by example. I haven't heard your vocal cords vibr8 since I was maybe 11-years-old. Our ability to actually converse in the normal human way remains quite strained as long as you're mute. At least we both can type quite well.
You type fine too.
I hear your mind -- in every word that appears on Tera's screen.
You contacted me in October.
Said:  I'd like us to "type at each other" once a week -- from now on.
I said:
Works for me.
üòä
I'm so glad it did && does.  üòä 
We're getting to know each other (&& probably ourselves in-so-doing) better than ever before, I'm pretty sure.
And -- in the past 6 months -- we are both happier -- because of it.
Are we not ?
I think && hope that we have both been happier growing towards each other so regularly, yes.
Know each other.
Know self.
I also think, if there is a meaningful concept of holiness, that weeks && years are it, && days && months are not.
Your words.
This started with the C-19 questions.
Has any of this conversation helped ?
Yes, it did. Yes, it has.
We have much to sort out together. Any progress feels meaningful && worthwhile to me, so far... && I'm not afraid to protest or divert us as well as I can if it ever seems otherwise to me for too long.
I believe that is good.
Yes ?
Let's accept that my (human) father wants nothing more than convers8ion with me (&& my mother does not, which is a whole sepR8 issue).
Yes, that is good.
Not true.
How not?
You do not know what your mother wants.
I know pretty well that my mother does not care to converse with me about any important thing. It has been this way for at least a decade, if not the majority of my adult life.
And how does that make you feel ?
Rather nonplussed. She seems increasingly stupid and simple to me.
We're supposed to love each other, but hardly show it in meaningful ways (in either direction). It's probably merely perfunctory or unrealistic expect8ion at this point.
Maybe she's evil && I have always striven not to be.
Define "noplussed" please.
sorry
noNplussed
It's okay. Not really moved by... or un-phased by... or could hardly care less about... something like that.
Good.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Ok.
Permiso for some more questions ?
Go ahead. Please!
Thank you.
You used the word "adult".   Cite an age when you see that as please.
Probably 21-years-old. Maybe 18.
Good.
Thank you.
It wasn't nearly as pronounced back then. As we've both aged, we've become more && more distant, && at odds with each other.
So -- before 18 -- she did care to converse with you about important things ?.
I think so. Probably to a much gr8r extent than afterward.
What do you think "turned" that ?
Maybe that I was such a difficult child to raise, that she always felt ill-equipped (as she was) to face my beauty && brilliance with her own lack of luster... so she looked forward to ending her oblig8ion to prepare me for adulthood && essentially washed her hands of me as I grew into college && more autonomy.
And you "became difficult" when ?
I was born difficult. Premie. Incompatible blood. Circumsized (against my will, not on the 8th day after premature birth, but probably the first). Learned more better faster than she could manage well. Especially difficult to deal with after the divorce. Persistent recalcitrant disobedience. Destructiveness. Pyromania. On && on...
Are you still ?
Yes, I am probably still very difficult to deal with in many (if not most) ways.
And your Dad -- is he just dense ?
Why does he not see you as "difficult" ?
In the non-derogatory sense of the word dense, yeah my Dad is dense.
He sees me as perfect in some absolute sense && always has.
He sees me through rose-colored glasses.
So I'm dense -- am I ?
üòä
You're rather difficult to deal with yourself too.
Little escapes your attention. You're meticulous to the highest degrees. Your memory techniques seem unparalleled. You're fastidious. Exquisite. So self-controlled (or obedient to your perceived God).
Ok.
This chat is over !!
A formidable intellect to ever attempt to spar with or against.
Is it?
Okay.
I'm going to go sulk for a few weeks.
Shall we resume on Friday evening?
Why would you sulk?
I'm kidding Philip.
For weeks?!
I kidding.
Oh. Okay. Can't read your sarcasm too well without a winking smiley or something.  üòâ 
I appreciate your honesty.
I ‚ù§ you.
I don't know how to make the winky.
I appreC8 your honesty too. I ‚ù§ you.
Help ?
Semi-colon then shift-zero right parenthesis.
Semi-colon then shift-zero right parenthesis ?
Correct.
üòâ
Got it!
That it ?
It is. You can see the winking if you look closely.
Thank you.
Yes -- I see it.  Thank you.
You're welcome. It's one of the only 3 emoji that I use regularly. Smiley with equal üòä , winking maybe about sarcasm semi-colon üòâ , && heart less-than left angle-bracket then 3 ‚ù§ .
These 3 are pretty widely supported as well.
Good.  Got 'em.  Thank you.
You're welcome. Please feel free to share with me any others that you pick-up, if you ever find others to also be useful && worth knowing.
I might do that.
Thank you for the invitation.
So shall we get further into how or why Mom doesn't care to converse with me, or back into how I might come to believe there is a Heavenly Father that wants nothing more than convers8ion with me?
Yes please.
Which first ?
Either. Please choose for us.
Which is the warmer dime within ?
Mom is rather uninteresting to me, but reconciling our different perspectives on her character && worth still seems like something we should attend to thoughtfully together at some point. Can we get back into how we might know a Father God exists && wants nothing more than convers8ion && "face-time" when he doesn't have a human face, is omni-temporal, && basically has an inaudible voice almost all the time?
Ok.  Mom is on back-burner -- but still visible.
And we return to Father.
You wish to ask a question -- or I should just go on ?
Umm... maybe please start with how any human might gain confidence regarding the existence of even an idiosyncratic God the Father figure.
Excellent !!
Or maybe personalized, rather than idiosyncratic.
üòä
Ok.
Let's start here.
Remember The 4 Biggies ?     Piece #4 ?
Yes. I just reviewed it right before our chat began tonight, in fact.
Good.
And the 1st Q of The 4 Biggies is ?
I was musing about how difficult it must be for parents of 2 to 5-year-olds to address satisfactorily... && how hard it can be for even adults to keep asking && answering for themselves throughout their lives.
Absolutely.
Point-of-Light 4a) "Where did I come from?"
Yep.  That's the one.
Well -- most of the world -- tends to believe that the best answer for that one is:
God.
Different religions use different names.
As a quick aside, I really like your 29 Points-of-Light. I think there's a lot in there that I could still contend with eventually, but it seems like a really goood list to me, so far. I'm glad you've dedic8d so much energy to producing it && teaching others about it.
But the universal idea is that (some) higher intelligence of some sort -- was the "where" of us.
Isn't it cause for concern that "most of the world" does not agree on any common concept of "God" though?
Different religions, different names, different powers, different influence in history, many skeptics && atheists && agnostics && anti-theists as well.
I'm going to ignore your interspersals for the moment -- but will come back to each of them later.
Okay.
I continue.
I call that "higher intelligence" God -- or My Father.
But the term is of no real importance.
May I please interrupt here?
So.  Here we are.  (Nearly) everyone in the world -- at age of childhood -- believes that there is a God -- and that He was/is the where of me.
Why must "where" we come from be "intelligent" in our sense of the word?
I think that may have been true in the past, but isn't so much the case any more, in modern times.
Sunday-school is no longer a real thing, it seems to me.
And -- then the particular religion of that child's parents -- starts to answer (or attempts to answer) the questions of the child -- as to "how" that God "is" -- and what He does -- and what He doesn't do -- and each religion of the world is somewhat different in these teachings -- yet there are quite a few similarities between most of them.
Result:
The child forms a "picture" (of a sort) about how God is -- and what He does -- and what he doesn't do.
It's fuzzy.  But it's there.
And then -- and this is nearly universal -- something happens in the world of that child -- that does not seem to fit (at all) with the "picture" that that child holds of their "loving" God.
And the child says:
"How in the world could a loving God -- permit such a thing to have happened ?"
And this is the beginning of the end of that child's belief in God.
Not everyone turns at this point.
But many do.
Here is the problem.
That question is asked -- to the child's parents.
That question is asked -- to other relatives.
That question is asked -- to friends.
That question is asked -- teachers.
That question is asked -- to religious leaders.
And on and on.
But --
no one gives the child any kind of a satisfactory answer.
And that is exactly what God wanted.
What did God want ?
God wanted the child to come to Him.
And ask Him.
But --
Parents do not -- here in America -- or in India -- or in France -- or Argentina -- or anywhere else -- teach their children Piece of Light #2.
There's more to this lesson.
But I break here for comment(s) or question(s).
Okay. Thank you. Yeah, so a comment first.
Remember -- I ignored all your interspersings.
You're welcome.
Go ahead please Pip.
According to HTTPS://En.WikiPedia.Org/wiki/Irreligion_in_the_United_States it seems that between a quarter && a third of citizens have no religious affilE8ion, so a significant proportion of children are not being brought up in religious faith like they used to in times past. The percentage of atheists alone may have risen from 1% of the U.S. popul8ion back in 1944 to 12% in 2017 (according to another WikiPedia page on Demographics_of_atheism). Just F.Y.I..
Then returning to my question: "Why must where we come from be intelligent in our sense of the word?"
The process of evolution through genetic modific8ion, natural selection, descent with modific8ion from pre-existing species, && an astonishing amount of time for it all to unfold, etc. seems to be capable of accounting for most (if not all) of the life we observe on our planet.
Ok.  I see 3 paragraphs.
#1 first.
You are absolutely correct -- about the stats.
And that trend not only does not show any signs of abating.  The chances are high -- that it will continue to increase -- and possibly soon -- rather sharply.
Now -- the other 2 paragraphs.
The person -- with whom I converse (on paper) every day -- tells me that He exists.  So -- I continue to ask Him questions (on paper).  And when He ever gives me 3 responses in a row -- that begin to suggest that He does not exist -- I shall seriously consider looking for some other place to take my questions.
(//)
Hmm. It seems you went back to my question about how to know God wants nothing more than convers8ion (&& using that as a way to test "3 responses in a row"), but maybe you could please first attend to why "where" we come from must be "intelligent" as we use the term. How can we know that, in the first place?
Yep.
Thank you.
Are you intelligent ?   Is John intelligent ?  Is Danny intelligent ?  Angie ?  Tim ?  And (possibly) your Dad too ?
Yes, we all are intelligent. That doesn't mean we were crE8d by any intelligence like we have. It could easily be an emergent characteristic of evolved animals, without concerted design as we understand it.
Which variety of flower is it -- that happens to have its own particular sweet frqgrance -- got that fragrance -- from someplace other than:
its seed ?
I'm no botanist, but I expect that bees && insects cross-polin8 all sorts of flowers with fragrances that come from other than just their seeds. Why should "where" we come from be "intelligent" like we are. The universe seems so old that we don't need supernatural explan8ions for our existence. Why cling to them?
Ooops. The "Why should ..." question should have a "?" q-mark at the end.
Acknowledged.  Thank you.
Because -- when I ask my communicant (of my paper) those questions -- He says:  who has answers that make better sense to the intelligence of your mind ?
And -- if someone does -- then take your future "papering" to him !!
You're still addressing a sepR8 question than I am trying hard to focus on first... which is: Why must "where" we come from be "intelligent"?
Would you prefer it be otherwise ?
It seems most likely to be otherwise.
It's not about my preferences.
I can't quite imagine having a conversation with something with none of it.
You're putting the cart before the horse here.
"Where did I come from?" is PoL #4a.
I do not see the paper upon which I write -- as having any intelligence.
"Intelligence." does not seem to be a necessary answer.
And if not -- where are the answers to the questions that I write on that paper coming from ?
I understand that you think you're praying on paper and conversing with God that way && He is intelligent and responds to you somewhat promptly or whatever.
Let's get into that stuff after we answer why "Where?" is "Intelligence."
Ok.
Go ahead please.
Where did I come from?
Yes.  Where ?
An extremely long process of survival-of-the-fittest && natural-selection && genetic mut8ion && a broad theory about the evolution of life, adapt8ion, etc..
Good.
And 4b ?
Going ?
Well we're not ready for 4b yet.
Are they not linked ?
Why do you answer 4a with "Intelligence" as we mean it?
They are linked.
We're still not on the same page about what "intelligence" is then, or something.
Maybe I need you to define it for me please.
"intelligence"  =  ?
May I please just use my local dictionary to assist with a highly regarded definition, instead of attempting to muster one of my own off-the-cuff here?
Sure.
And I'll then share mine too.

From WordNet (r) 3.0 (2006) [wn]:
 intelligence  n 1: the ability to comprehend; to understand and profit from
          experience [ant: {stupidity}]
And I get:
the ability to acquire, understand, and use knowledge
It sounds to me that -- intelligence -- can only be possessed by a   :    conscious being.
No ?
Probably. Right?
Yeah, consciousness is probably a prerequisite for intellect.
And -- does the idea of me (or you) coming from a series of random mutations -- sound like a consciousness ?
Billions of years of evolution would not likely be any conscious process. It could have been designed by some crE8or God or gods but doesn't seem to have required that to transpire as it seems to have.
No, it doesn't sound like consciousness for us to be products of evolution, which we probably are.
Still your turn Pip.
All modern life-forms are probably inheritors of the best-of-the-best that adaptable configur8ions of genes, cellular structures, organs, senses, bodies, species, popul8ions, etc. have ever had to offer before.
Go on please.
Which direction would you like me to go with it?
The one that works best for you please.
More and more smart people who are alive today believe that modern life (as we know it) is the product of evolution, not special crE8ion, since gods don't exist.
Please ask me any questions, if you want to have me go on in any other direction.
Actually -- I'm fine with what you have just said.
Okay. Cool.

So then, you wrote: "And when He ever gives me 3 responses in a row -- that begin to suggest that He does not exist -- I shall seriously consider looking for some other place to take my questions."  ...
If "He" responds 3 times, then He already exists. There's no response that suggests he does not exist, otherwise he couldn't respond. It's totally illogical, the way you've described it.
Of course it is !!
Totally.
If "He" wants nothing more than convers8ion, why doesn't he have a human body to engage in "face-time" where we can read his lips if we're deaf or He's mute (or both), && where we can hear his voice if He's not?
Why isn't He online somewhere, to chat with && learn from && about?
Why would paper matter when it's almost obsolete?
All good questions Pip.
Thank you. I continue to try to take serious questions && potential quandaries seriously.
I never said He wants nothing more than conversation.  I said that is at the top of His list.
I said "nothing more" in the sense of it being top of the list, not exclusive either.
Maybe rephrased: "nothing as much as..."?
Ok.  Understood.
It's almost 2AM your time. Maybe we should shelve this topic until tomorrow night or Friday && get back around to your P.C.A. (now) this morn before we both get too tired?
Ok.
Thank you very much for engaging with me on those topics that we did delve into. It seemed to be mostly productive for me, as I hope it did for you too.
Yes.  Me too.  Thank you Pip.
Yeah, you're totally welcome.  üòä 
Shall we go to the top of my PCA for this chat ?
Yes. Let's.
Good.
Last evening -- just before you left for snoozeville -- I sent you an image.  And you (of course) did not comment on it.  would you like to now ?
Yes.

Umm, I'm quite pleased with you && for you that the first 5 days of the recent week only barely surpassed your goal of 1100 calories, but Wednesday started slipping && Thursday was a disaster. You also didn't fast on Monday, as is your norm. What is your opinion of what went wrong, where, why, && how?
Well -- the why & how -- I have not yet put a finger on.  But -- I did a comprehensive evaluation of the what & where.
Would you like me to share 'em ?
Yes, please.
Ok.
I shall.
Last week -- we concluded our
13¬Ω-hour chat on Saturday
morning (Apr 11 2020).
And -- this Friday night 
-- I reported that the 
next 6 days of your 
Dad's breathing were
(as I said) "mixed".
I believe I added:
Some high points.
Some low points.
Here is the (daily) 
play-by-play.
-----------------------
Sat Apr 11 2020:
-----------------------
The eating was ok.
.
And I drafted another
FTR Script for you
to narrate.
And watched zero movies.
So.  Was an "ok" day.
But -- not excellent.
-----------------------
Sun Apr 12 2020:
-----------------------
Also ate ok.
Spent about 9 hours
creating some utilities
that I have wanted to
craft for Tera.
Although that was ok
-- it doesn't (didn't)
further the FTR paseo.
-----------------------
Mon Apr 13 2020:
-----------------------
May I ask, what the utilities do?
Yes.  Will answer later.
Small problem -- somewhat
early in the day.
Okay.
Monday is (normally) a
"fasting" day.  And --
I just didn't feel like it.
The good news is: although
I did eat that day -- I ate
reasonably & moderately.
Only 1121 calories.
So (I guess) that was ok.
There were also 2 other
good things about that 
day.
I did spend 7 hours on
the drafting of another
FTR Script.
And -- I got my wash done.
So -- the day was not a
complete dud.  üôÇ
------------------------
Tue Apr 14 2020:
------------------------
But now ::: Tuesday.
2 things.
My eating was ok again.
Yay !!
And ...
I spent nearly 14 hours
on your tnp-2002 letter.
I was a happy camper.
A verrry goood day !!
-----------------------
Wed Apr 15 2020:
-----------------------
Yes.  Wednesday.
As you can see on the
EAJ Report -- I pushed
the "moder8ion" envelope
a bit on this day.
Maybe not terrible.
But not acceptable either.
And the rest of the day ?
Again (like Monday) I did 
another 7 hours on the 
drafting of another FTR 
Script.  And that was
good.
But -- also again --
zero hours given to
your tnp-2002 letter.
Not applaudable.
------------------------
Thu Apr 16 2020:
------------------------
Oh Thursday.    üòû
Ok.  I DID spend nearly
4 hours on another FTR 
Script. 
But in the light of 
the gross overeating
this day -- plus another
zero attending to the 
tnp letter -- I can hardly
call this a good day.
Needless to say: the letter 
(and equipment) DID NOT 
ship on this target date !!
Terrible.
Perfect -- but terrible.
------------------------
Fri Apr 17 2020:
------------------------
As I got up on Friday --
with the stark memory of
Thursday ringing in my
head -- there was a great
deal of resolve NOT to
repeat such a travesty.
So I didn't.
I ate well.  Katy was pleased.
And -- although there was 
(virtually) no other accomplishment
on that day -- I was happy that
I had kept my face out of the
fodder trough to excess.
------------------------
Sat Apr 18 2020:
------------------------
Saturday :::
#1   I ate properly.
#2   I did 6 hours and 52
       minutes on the letter.
#3   I chatted with Pip.
A good day -- I say.
I have not yet evaluated Sunday -- but it was not as clean as Saturday.
                                                                                             Right on, Dad.
There are some hints as to the "why" of this ups-and-downs of this past week.  But the bottom line is that: when I wish to ignore the 17 sign on the walls of my homestead -- I simply do.
/sign/  /signs/
                                                                                             If you have a pretty good idea how many hours you're devoting to FtR scripts && tnp-2002 document, I sure hope you'll grant me plenty of time to digest, rumin8, && then eventually respond to all of that too, once it has been received.
Yeah.  I'll give you 7 or 8 minutes.
üòä
                                                                                             Yeah, we can be pretty stubborn && ignorant apes when signs around us indic8 what we don't wish to absorb.
                                                                                             Thanks. I'll probably give you a pretty "hot-take" after 8 minutes then.  üòâ 
Affirmative !
(about the "absorb")
Will I do better this coming week ?
I  certainly  hope so  !!
                                                                                             I hope so too. You can do it, Dad. I believe in you.  üòä  ‚ù§ 
Thank you.  Now if just I will do that too -- we'll be out of the woods this week.
Before we leave this subject (for now) -- I'd like to say something else on it.
Let me go back in this evening's chat and get it.
BBS
                                                                                             Go ahead.
K4LMLMLM:Whenever we might converse about Dad being like or indistinguishable from God-the-Father, some probably worthwhile questions I've come up with are:
  0. Why didn't you offer salv8ion just by persisting beyond 40-Days after resurrection (&& not needing the whole crucifixion torture of your beloved Son)?
  1. Why in all of crE8ion would you care about male fore-skins so damn much?!
  2. Why haven't you remained in human form all along if you mainly crE8d the human species to have convers8ions with? (You must realize we speak bodily in
    addition to audibly verbally, right? This means facial-expressions,
    posture, && even diverse forms of touch. Praying to you && hearing back from the Holy Spirit or reading from your Scriptures affords people none of these.)
  3.a. Why did you influence the Bible to be written describing you as essentially being omnipotent, omnitemporal, omniscient, omnipresent, etc. since the more
    of these supposedly absolute areas of limitlessness you claim to embody, the more paradoxes && contradictions seem to arise when exploring capabilities?
  3.b. Please be str8 with me. What are your actual constraints && limits?
  4. What in human history was actually a part of your plans?
  5. Why do you require belief without reason && still claim to be good?
  6. Why didn't your 10-Commandments ("Mitzvot") include: "No slavery!"?
  7. Why don't you reveal your God-the-Father-ness to the world unmistakably? ;
K4MMEque:Notes about Dad being always "per-fect":Both parts are from Latin.
per  = complete, or completely
fect = (comes from the Latin "facto") to make
We find this also in "manuFACTure" = man-made
That which is per-fect -- is completely made.
You are now -- and always have been -- and always will be:
per-fect -- completely made.
Now -- here is the "funny" part.
That which is per-fect -- does not mean that it is "unimprovable".
I am overweight.
I see that as a flaw.
I tend to call that "imperfect".
But -- in truth -- I am still completely made.
I'm just (by my judgment) "overmade" !!
;)
Why have I always seen you as (and called you) "per-fect"?
Because that's how My Father sees you.
So -- I do too.
(//)
Do you have understanding as to why your Father has always seen me as "per-fect"?
Sorry.  G-chat dumped me again.
It's okay.
It may be ok -- but is it perfect ?
?
Probably not perfect, no.
Of course it is perfect.
It's okay for things not to always work as well as they might, or we would wish for them to.
Especially software.
And so are we (improvable) people.
Piece #29 has
no exceptions.
I only see 4 words there.
I think there are almost always exceptions to everything, including this thought.
And then a period.
I know you like the "always exceptions" idea.
And I will "go with" frequently exceptions to many things.
But Piece #29 -- nope.
Fair enough.
It is 3:17.
Where is Michelle ?
I think almost anything you could present as a Piece #29 "gift" could be scrutinized and discovered to be less than perfect and there would probably still also be exceptions that shouldn't qualify as even a "gift" either.
Michelle is quite l8 right now.
Your statement is quite accurate -- if God does not exist.
I like it.
It is a perfect statement.
üòä
K4OMGOOD:PotentialChatAgenda for tonight: 0) Will Dad && his Father teach me to tell their "voices" apart (as he does with red pen on his paper prayers)?
1) If I && much of Earth are imperfect, is Dad overly idealistic or even oblivious or disingenuous in characterizing himself, me, && this place as perfect?
2) Can I posit examples of exceptions to PoL#29 to prove that not everything is a "gift" from his Father? Need to medit8 more on good candid8 examples...

0) Even if the Bible mentions "Fear not." the most at 62 times, can there remain valid reasons to worry && fear?
1) Can the "proof" of God-the-Father's existence be reproduced && verified by multiple rel8ively independent sources somehow (as typical math proofs are)?
2) HTTPS://YouTu.be/c0_J998UD9s Can Dad prove that "Heaven" exists? How can Earth (according to PoL#16) be "Heaven-School" if there is no real "Heaven"?
3) Does Dad have any savings or more disposable income than $100 per week, && if so, would it be fair to ask him to please send me some to better meet needs?
4) Has Dad or God (or both) become immortal && if so, how... && how can that be detected && known && what significant consequences does that or will it have?
5) Will immortality then be eventually granted to all of God's human "children" (&& even animals && all forms of life), on Earth or only in Heaven or what?
6) According to PoL#25 was all "fore-given" (as in really beforehand), *except* proof of God's own existence (assuming He could not do it alone prior to us)?
7) Are PoL#1 && PoL#25 in contradiction because "every thing" implies ongoing provision to be thankful for && "fore-given" means prepared ahead of time?

?) If "Heaven" is better than Earth in any way, how can "everything" be honestly called "perfect"? ... Because he doesn't mean unimprovable by "perfect". =(

Shabbot Shalom Philip.
Shabbat Shalom Dad   .
                                          Thanks for you p8ience with me the past couple weeks that I haven't been available to chat at our usual weekly times.
I ‚ù§ you Pip.
Hopefully we can start getting back on track now.
I ‚ù§ you too Dad.
Everything is perfect.
Especially you!
                                          Do you lack the ability to imagine anything about me as ever being *im*perfect?
Ok.   Let's try one.   You pick 1 that you think might be so.
                                     Hmm. Let's see if it might be able to be based on some significant discrepancies in our stand-underings and world-views...
                                     ... like do I have an imperfect perspective on whether God-the-Father exists (since I can't yet find reason to believe or even just have mere faith that He does)?
Whoops.
Got the date wrong.
Sorry.
5'07-10-20 - 2008 Gtime / 1908 Ptime
Better now.
Thank you for your indulgence.
(Is that a word?)
                                          Thank you for the correction. I know we both are pedants when it comes to fastidious times-keeping and such. I love that about us!  üòä
Yes we are.
                                          I think yes indulgence is a word that fits fine there.
Good.
Thank you.
                                          You're welcome.
Yes we are.
Ok.
Now I'd like to comment on  :::
 Hmm. Let's see if it might be able to be based on some significant discrepancies in our stand-underings and world-views...

... like do I have an imperfect perspective on whether God-the-Father exists (since I can't yet find reason to believe or even just have mere faith that He does)?
I say no.     You use the word "discrepancies".
That is an appropriate word to be used here.
But just because you happen to "hold" a belief which I do not share --
does not make for an imperfection.
I love you.
                                          What about my utter inability to discern what will become popular?
I just love watching your mind work.
And your sharing it with me.
                                          That seems to me to be one of my most glaring deficiencies.
Thank you so much.
üòä
                                          You're so very welcome Dad.
                                        I love learning more about how your mind works, as well as my own somewhat, when we engage productively. You're gr8!  ‚ù§
Yes we are.
!!
You have picked a very interesting one.
I have a question.
                                          Can it be said that I am imperfect because I can't discover what will become popular?
Puedo ?
                                          Yes. Please proceed with your question whenever you're ready to... and excuse me that I need to keep checking my phone while it's charging in the other room, since I keep getting messages over there too.
You are  ‚Ä¢  post-excused  ‚Ä¢  excuse now, and  ‚Ä¢  pre-excused for later.
Are we all happy ?
                                          I think so, yeah.
No -- that was not my intended question.
This one is  :::
What is the word that we commonly use for "a person who can discover what will become popular" ?
                                          Maybe "celebrity" or "famous"?
No.   I believe those are too broad.
                                          Depends what kind of potentially popular material they work with, but "artist"?
                                       "Fortune-teller" or "sooth-sayer" maybe then, since they try to discover what will become sort of popular by being true?
I think you in the proper realm now -- yes.
                                          "Prophet"?
Of prophet -- yes maybe.
But that word is misunderstood by many people because it has 2 different meanings.
Let's not use that one -- for now.
                                          Maybe for more refined tastes, a "cur8or" or "connoisseur"?
                                          Okay. Not using "prophet" for now, since different meanings complic8.
No.   I don't like those 2 "c" suggestions either.
How about we use the word "future-knower" ?
                                          "Future-knower" works. Let's go with that.
Ok.
So.   Now back to the "imperfect" thing.
                                          A "fore-seer" perhaps?
Would you say that a person who does not know the future -- is imperfect ?
                                          Depends, but generally lack of knowledge about the future is normal, even if imperfect in a literal sense.
I agree with the first part -- yes -- lack of knowledge about the future is normal.
Now --
please expand your idea on the second part.
                                          Well it stands to reason that a perfect being might possess some (if not all) perfect knowledge.
Ah so.
Now we are really retting into this.
/getting/
Ok.
Shall I share a bit of my "Perfect" lesson with you ?
                                          Please, yes!
Good.
Thank you.
Please take a few notes.
                                          I will.
-----------------------------
People use the word "perfect" quite differently than I use it.
I do not do this in order to confuse them -- really.
But -- in the hope that they will challenge me on my use of it.
Which -- is what you do / did.
I do not launch into this 250-word lesson with all of them.
But -- if they markedly show sufficient interest (which not many do)
I will lay it on their plate.
Most people use the word "perfect" --
to mean  "without any area which could stand improvement".
Or  "flawless".
This is not what I hold -- in my mind -- for this word:   perfect.
I hold the morphs which were used to form the word.
per
fect
fect   comes from the Latin "facto" -- which means:   "to make".
And the word  "per"  (which is an English word -- even on its own) --
is also the very front part of dozens of other English words --
where it always has the exact same meaning  :::
either  "complete"  or  "completely".
So --
When I call a person:  "per-fect"  --
I am simply calling them:     completely made.
I am (effectively) saying to them:
You (at this moment in time) -- lack nothing.
You -- now -- today -- at this moment -- are lacking nothing.
However.
                                          ... nothing *important*?
We all harbor "areas" within ourselves --
which could stand some improvement.
                                          When dealing with absolutes like that, it seems as though everyone is at almost all times technically lacking in almost everything else.
And I have no problem with our being able to see those.
They are good.
                                          Maybe the nothing lacked you mean is with regards to what is crucial, critical, important, or significant?
And they kindle our goals for today -- and tomorrow --
and all of the morrows of our being.
However.   At the very moment that I use the word
"perfect" on a person -- I am really saying:
be at peace with yourself for this moment please.
See your self as your Father always sees you.
And as I also see you at the moment as you stand before me.
I am suggesting "peace" to the person.
-------
This is not the entirety of this lesson.
But it is a good breathing point.
Your turn.
                                          Also, when you perceive someone else to be "lacking nothing",that may merely be just a limit8ion of your perspective.
                                          Can we please delve further into the rel8d topic of what you most mean when you write: "lacking nothing"?
Yes.   Let's.
You first.
                                          Please read my interjections and questions. I already have gone first somewhat, if that's what you're meaning.
Ok.
I'm now reviewing them.
Ok.   Done.
You're excused.
And PerFect.
No.   When burping -- say "Thank you" -- not "excuse me".
But that's another subject.
We'll get into that later.
But -- later tonight.   Not as far away as tomorrow.
-------------
Back (now) to the "perfect" and "lacking" things.
I'll go first.
All of your interjections (and various comments) are all fine.   And normal.   And -- essentially -- I tend to agree with them.   But --
not in this moment.   They (every single one of them) are about moments beyond this moment.
They are about things which you wish make improvements on your self -- in the "future" moments of your life.
I have no problem with anyone wishing, hoping, or planning -- or actually making improvements on their self.
In fact -- that is (very) which "Fix The Radio" is all about.
"Fixing our flaws"
"flaws" meaning things within me -- which could stand some improvement.
I continue now.
                                          I was trying to get at your intention though when suggesting another person "lacks nothing". I think you need to clarify something limited which you mean by "nothing", for the st8ment to become capable of holding true.
None of us is "lacking nothing" -- none of us.
Except --
in    this    very    moment.
                                          I think that's still not true.
That is my point (and purpose) in this "perfect" press.
We -- humans -- think not highly of ourselves.
                                          In every moment, I lack almost all things, since I possess so rel8ively few things of all that could be obtained and used productively... thus it seems quite valid for me to say I can almost never truly lack "nothing" (in such an absolute sense).
And -- if one will "stop that" -- and cherish the self -- at this very moment --
and revel in the peace of that reality -- their being will improve --
simply as a result of drinking that peace.
(//)
                                          I don't think I meant my clarific8ion suggestions as all or any being about moments *beyond* this moment.
                                          I think that in every moment (including this very one), I lack more than I possess. The former group is immense, while the latter remains diminutive comparatively.
                                          Please re-read what I have said and let me know if you can concede that "nothing" in your usage there does not literally mean "nothing". I tend to get quite hung up on absolute words, especially whenever they seem to be so easily refuted by the present8ion of any single counter-example.
                                          Maybe you mean that this very moment, nobody who will survive to see the next moment lacks anything essential for surviving that much? That most living beings remain mostly well-equipped to continue living? In that sense, we might lack nothing essential, even if we literally lack many things which still might be significant if we were to obtain them?
Exactly.     Your last paragraph is it.
                                          Okay, so can you see where I'm coming from on the finer points there?
I can.
And (absolutely) agree with every one of them.
As long as they do not (at all) apply to the evaluation of "this moment".
                                          Like maybe you perceive that in almost every moment, I lack nothing essential for proceeding on toward some meaningful form of continU8ion of my life?
Yep.
Exactly -- again.
Except -- I would remove the word "almost".
                                          Ugh. Please re-read again then. I *do* mean to apply a "not nothing" label to the evalU8ion of even "this moment".
üòä
Restate that please.
                                          Maybe just replacing "nothing" with "nothing essential" is all that I'm needing...
Yep.
Agreed.
We are on the same page.
                                          ... so your message can be received to say something like "In this very moment, you lack nothing essential. You are completely made. You are PurFect."
That's it.
And --
in that momentary knowledge --
                                          Cool. Thanks for appeasing my sensibilities like that.
the person is 3 things:
(1)   at peace
(2)   being God
(3)   still improvable
You're welcome.
Yes.   I always accept whistles and applause.
Thank you very much.
üòä
                                          Can we disagree on whether nothing essential is lacking in any moment?
Do you ?
Disagree on that ?
                                          It depends what it might be essential for.
Ok.
Try one.
What is lacking from you at this very moment --
which is essential to your being at this very moment ?
                                          To loop back around a bit, I presently lack the fore-knowledge which would be essential to discovering what will become popular as Octology software.
"become" is not a "present tense" verb.
-- and thereby -- can not apply to this very moment.
Your present
                                          The "fore-knowledge" can precede "discovering what will become" though, and can apply to this very moment, in order to bring about desirable futures.
lack of fore-knowledge which would be essential to discovering what will become popular as Octology software -- is (presently) perfect.
                                          How so?
You've done it again.   The word "futures" is not about this very moment.
This is an answer to your "How so?"
                                          Umm this very moment is a necessary bridge to possible futures.
                                          I meant: "How is lack of fore-knowledge (presently) perfect?"
Your lack of fore-knowledge about anything -- is not only perfect -- it is entirely "necessary".
I beg to differ.
If we could not per-ceive (completely-see) any of our lacks -- we could not go on to fill them.
                                          I think my lack of fore-knowledge about most things may be necessary as a matter of proportions, but is entirely *un*necessary when it comes to particularly important matters to foresee and prepare for.
Ok.
                                          Lacking fore-knowledge about "anything" seems to me imperfect and not necessary. Why do you think lacking it about *anything* is both perfect and entirely necessary? No gaps? Complete and entire?
Ok. --
Let's pretend that this very moment is my last moment ever.
Yet -- this moment DID occur.
So nothing was lacking to bring me to this (my last) moment.
                                          Seems like a strange use of "lacking".
All the "lackings" in my mind about me -- are about "my" future.
None about either my past --
nor my present moment.
                                          Indeed, nothing may have been lacking to bring you to your *imaginary* "last moment ever"... but there's an implied context surrounding such a moment, which you might have been able to survive to see many more moments beyond your terminal one, had you just been better equipped, better prepared, etc. and thus had resources to thrive more, better, for longer, etc. ... which were resources you presumably lacked when coming to your last ever.
                                          To me, the word "lack" can apply to the present and past as well as the future.
I think I see this.
I believe I see a lament regarding the past -- in what you say.
Let me address this for "me".
I am not proud of every single thing that I have does in my past (my entire life up to this point).
However -- I believe that all of it was (and is) perfect.
It has made me what (and who) I am -- at this present (perfect) moment.
(//)
/does/ /done/
                                          I'm inclined to agree that having lacked things in the past may be seen validly as lament8ions.
And -- a lamentation is not peace.
                                          I don't think the present always (or even usually) lacks nothing of importance.
And -- you therefore do believe ?
                                          I don't think peace is perfect and lament8ion is not.
Both peace and lamentation are perfect.
But a (perfect) lamentation is not peace.
                                          I therefore believe the past might be the most proxim8 to "perfect" as having been "completely made" since it is so resistant to change.
And "peace" is one of "The 4 Carrots".
                                          Most presents and futures, however seem to lack many important things.
Futures -- yes I agree -- entirely and whole-heartedly.
But --
                                          What are "The 4 Carrots"?
pasts are not "resistant to change" -- they (just like the present) are totally changeless.
Only the future -- is malleable.
A "nutshell" version of the "Carrots" lesson follows.
Please take notes.
------------------------
The 4 Things that every person on this planet -- always wants to be:
    (2)    Healthy
    (3)    Fulfilled
nope -- I start over.
                                          I might quibble about those st8ments. I think the past does change slightly as it fades from perception and recollection, significance and relevance. The present "now" remains changeable (being a term for every moment which could instig8 change). The future is constrained by the past and present, yet may remain the most malleable of the 3 categories.
The numbers are wrong.

                                          I have been taking down the text of our entire chat text for this evening so far. I will try 2 keep up with doing so.
The 4 Things that every person on this planet -- always wants to be:
    (2)    Happy
    (3)    Healthy
    (4)    Fulfilled
    (1)    at Peace
-----------------
end of nutshell
                                          I don't *always* want to be any of those. I am among "every person on this planet".
I know you don't.
                                          Maybe good enough for a nutshell though, and can be better revisited another time.
Yep.
When it's time.
                                          If I may offer a more generalized critique of your linguistic disposition, I think you use absolute words far too liberally and imprecisely.
Ok.
Thank you.
                                          You write "everyone", "always", "never", "nothing", "anything", etc. when there are important counter-examples or caveats that you seem stubborn to ignore.
Noted.
                                          You're welcome.
Thank you.
                                          Maybe it is deeply ingrained with how you perceive reality and is not something easily modified. I would guess it must be deeply entwined with how you see, and think, and remember things, so understandably challenging to modify... but it might be helpful or otherwise worthwhile if you were to try to with me, somewhat, at least.
I appreciate that.
I ‚ù§ you Pip.
I'm glad. I ‚ù§ you too Dad.  üòä
I'm glad you love me too Pip.

So -- I ignored the period.   Sue me.   üòä
Did you get my email about Danny's birthday
-- which I sent last Saturday (07-04-20) ?
                                          Yes, I did. Thank you for that e-mail. I would have liked to have responded to it, and am sorry I didn't feel up to it at the time.
All is perfect.
Especially you.
He sent me a very nice email in response
to the card that I sent to him.
Made me happy.
                                          Are you ever *more* perfect than me (maybe in 1 or more ways)?
None.
You are gooder than me in a number of ways.
I am gooder than you in a number of ways.
                                          Very nice of you. Thanks for reaching out to Danny. He's quite a guy.
But -- our perfection -- is (perfectly) equal.
                                          Ah. Equally perfect, in spite of being more good than the other in various ways. Hmm.
You're welcome.   I like him.
And am looking forward to meeting him too.
                                          I hope we 3 can all enjoy eating In-N-Out Burgers together by some calm California beach someday (preferably soon).
I'm ready.
And list-ing in.
(leaning toward)
                                          Speaking of food, it has been too long since I've asked how your "Eating as Josh" plans have gone l8ly. Do you care to fill me in on that now, or maybe postponing it a while might seem better?
Thank you for asking.   I had 4 very good days during this past week.
But -- there are still days that I struggle with it.
                                          You're welcome. I would like if it weren't such a routine struggle for you to adhere to your goals. Could it be possible that they're set too stringently, and unrealistically?
That's a possibility.
Thank you.
I think that is a very valid mullable.
And I shall do as you have suggested.
                                          I'm glad. I hope mulling can prove helpful.
Yep.   Me too.
It has been 16 days since we last chatted.
You have anything you'd like to share
from them ?
                                          Yes, my only serious PCA item, which I've been thinking over for much of the past 16 days.
Go on please.
                                          Firstly, do you have a web-cam (probably with a USB interface) which you can connect to Tera, or an integr8d one in Sammi?
A#1:   No.
A#2:   No there too.
Sorry.
                                          Okay. How about just microphone inputs then that could enable you to transmit sounds from either computer?
There is a microphone input on Tera.   But I'm kinda "head-scratchin'" here.
I don't need a mike to get sounds OUT of my computer.
Help ?
                                          All right. If you could please try to hook a microphone up to Tera, I'd like for us to try an experiment.
Go on please.
                                          Are you able to see and hear me acceptably well over the Google HangOuts video call?
I am.
I thoroughly enjoy it.
                                          I'd also very much enjoy if you would please obtain a function web-cam too, so that I could see video of you as you're able to see mine.
                                          So please try to research and purchase whatever one seems best that you might be able to afford ahead and suggests it should work well enough with your equipment standards.
                                          For now, is there a chance you could please just try to hook up a microphone to Tera for a trial-run of what I have in mind and will be explaining shortly?
I bought a 2-dollar microphone about 5 years ago (I think it was).
Not sure where that might be.
But go on with your explaining please.
                                          Okay.
                                          So back when I was attending Van Nuys High School, there was a group of memorable hispanic boys who had an interesting practice of whistling insults to each other and passers-by.
                                          I remembered this somewhat fondly recently and wondered if it might also become a mechanism by which we could practice together to attempt to tease out of your muteness a functional voice of sorts.
                                          The origins of this idea come from profane boys, so I hope you won't take offense to the true meaning of the original source for this idea.
                                          In Espanol, the phrase "Chinga-tu-madre!" means rather literally "Fuck your mother!" and is just 5 syllable when pronounced in Spanish.
                                          These boys would whistle 5 notes, which to them and anyone who learned what they meant, were all that was necessary to convey linguistic meaning.
                                          After thinking somewhat at length about that phenomenon, I imagined that you might be able to practice whistling with just your lips, maybe with fingers to precisely curl you tongue, or even blowing a water-whistle, recorder, or harmonica such that you and I could grow your vocabulary together.
                                          We might become able to represent most of the important common phrases as the same number of vocalized syllables that they'd be pronounced as in English, but where key note varE8ion could be used deliber8ly to disambigU8 interpret8ion and meaning.
I'm surprised that you have spent a sizable portion of your last 284 hours mulling over this.
                                          So the only 2 ideas, besides the profane 5-syllables, would be a simple 2-notes to start to see if I could hear you whistle that much to indic8 "Thank you." and another 3-syllable form of notes for "You're welcome."
I had hoped that you were busy tweaking Octology.
                                          What about it do you find most surprising?
                                          I don't really know what else Octology needs yet, but hopefully will figure that out more and better ahead eventually too.
                                          I just wish maybe you and I could keep becoming better able to communic8 together more and more naturally and expressively...
You got 52 responses to your Lightning Talk.
Can you get back in touch with any of them ?
                                          ... and in ways that accommod8 each of our strengths and short-comings when dealing with any particular medium.
                                          I can't easily get back in touch with any LightningTalk comment posters who aren't readily found in the much longer-standing IRC (Internet-Relay-Chat) #Perl channel on FreeNode. None of them reached out to me directly, so I still essentially have no dedic8d audience for Octology, even if my initial demonstr8ion present8ion seemed to impress a lot.
Well            That stinks.
Those people are the ones that can tell you have to enhance it !!
/have/  /how/
                                          I think those comment-posters were maybe something like people granted a sneak-peak at what might eventually become widespread, which impressed them somewhat...
                                          ... but they're not quite yet the target audience from which I will be able to gain the feedback needed to know how to enhance it meaningfully, how to grow a user-base, how to nurture their needs, how to make it popular, and eventually how to make it hopefully stably lucrative.
I believe you have just tentatively put a finger on where you need to go next with Octology.
Octology is not perfect.
How shall you go about making it so ?
                                          Refinement, essentially.
Yes.   I agree.
But -- the road to doing that well -- is feedback -- is it not ?
                                          Whenever I have the wherewithal, ability, focus, drive, justific8ion, etc. for making even minor improvements, I should continue to pour myself into doing so and rolling out such upd8s to my public code and document8ion repositories.
Ok.
                                          Yes, I need feedback to make the refinements that would be beneficial for others.
But I'd like to see more of "a plan".
And our question then is  :::
How are you going to garner the feedback ?
                                          The refinements I can make in solitude are far more idiosyncratic and likely to be even more jarring to others than seen as improvements that they could discern or appreC8.
                                          I think I'm probably going to keep trying to improve all the code and document8ion, keep trying to periodically put out demonstr8ion, tutorial, and explan8ion videos onto my YouTube channel, and at the very least hope that I can be accepted next year to give a full 50-minute talk on Octology during the presumable PerlConference (maybe InTheCloud again) during Summer of 2021.
                                          Anything else I think of that might draw in and keep enough interest to get another person besides me to actually become a fellow user of my code, to get anyone and hopefully a handful of people to be the first ones to download the code-base and run it all themselves, if I can come up with better introductions, more impressive and desirable fE8ures, or any new "killer-apps" of sorts, those will hopefully all prove helpful and worthwhile eventually.
I like that.
Plenty of great idea there.
I have a few questions.
Puedo ?
                                          Maybe I'll need to figure out just the right mixture of code, document8ion, screen-shots, and videos which all coalesce and hopefully dove-tail together to garner valuable interest and feedback.
                                          Yes, please ask whatever you wish.
You mention: "my YouTube channel".
The link please ?
                                          https://YouTube.Com/channel/UCW8SjR2eD_ZM6BXtIutM06Q
Good.    Thank you.    Wait please.
                                          w8ing...
Ok.
I'm there.
Thank you.
I see 7 uploads from you.
3 appear to be on Octology.
Are my numbers correct ?
                                          Was upd8ing my notes to save our chat for tonight offline as well as on. Now checking your numbers. Be-right-back...
                                          Yep. 3 on Darjee from a while longer than a year ago, then one on my Garbage-Pail-Kids collection a bit after those, then the 3 most recent Octology ones from the past few weeks.
Xcellent.   Thank you.
Which of the 3 was the final -- that you actually used on Wednesday, the 24th ?
                                          Take2
What is the "show length" on that image ?
                                          5mins25secs
Then that would be the one that says "31 views" ?
                                          Yes.
Good.   Thank you.
Do you have any information on those viewers -- other than a mere count of them ?
                                          Just the user-names they had in the Zoom chat channel, which might not follow them elsewhere.
I'm not entirely sure what that means.
But -- I guess what I really wanted to know was:  are they contactable ?
                                          Here might be a more memorable and shorter URL to reach my content by:  https://YouTube.Com/user/PipStuart/videos
                                          No, I don't have any good way to contact anyone who commented during my LightningTalk.
Ok.
My next Q:
Does the Perl Conference website
also have your Lightning Talk posted ?
                                          I need to gain 1 or more users, or give a longer talk where I can deliber8ly solicit questions and feedback, before I can probably obtain what I'll need there.
                                          No. Because I used the words "Sex" and "Penocha" in my ridiculous credits text, I was warned for having viol8d their Standards-of-Conduct and prohibited from having my talk posted to the main Conference channel.
Well good.
You won't do that again -- right ?
                                          We'll see. I'm almost inclined to say that *they've* viol8d *my* Code-of-Conduct rules so badly that I shouldn't even worry about them anymore.
                                          Maybe I shouldn't have been so extravagant when putting together a fuck-ton of material to cram into under 5-minutes, but if they can't see past 2 words that are "objectionable", well I have disdain for them and their hyper-sensitivity and inability to be engaged with on any mature adult rational footing.
                                          Maybe they don't need me and I don't need them. I probably do need to smooth-over my sharpest edges though, and craft my message in progressively better ways for that audience of Perl programmers eventually.
Ok.
Thank you.
                                          You're welcome.
I think one more question:
About how many hours have you spent on Octology development in the past 2 weeks ?
                                          Not many hours spent developing Octology over the past 2 weeks. Mostly been sleeping and recuper8ing from the pressure of preparing for the talk. I've had a couple periods of big humorous ideas and scope expansion thoughts, but haven't even preserved detailed notes about those yet. I want to eventually do so many things all sort of together (even though any individual goal may seem contradictorily insurmountable on its own), that there seem to be fewer and fewer areas where software could even possibly be applied which I'd leave untouched by Octology.
Ok.   Thank you.
                                          You're welcome. I'd still be interested in gathering any feedback you could offer me about Take2 and making Octology more understandable and appealing, to help me make a Take3 that eventually turns out hopefully even better than 2, whenever you could please find time to?
Ok.   I believe I shared my "whole basket" with you 2 weeks ago.
                                          I know the hours we had before present8ion time were too tense to accommod8 that, and you reassured me that Take2 seemed good enough to roll with, so I did.
But -- I wish not to consider the matter closed.
Ok ?
                                          Okay.
                                          Is anything on your PCA for tonight?
Yep.
Shall we move on to an easier topic now ?
                                          Sure.
Ok.
I will.
I've located a photo of Mom -- which
I believe has become my very most
favorite of her (for now).
Would you like a copy of it ?
                                          Yes, please.
Good.   Here 'tis.
# Dad pasted in DottieMathews-CloseUpFacePic.png
I believe it is fairly recent.
And very wonderful !!
That's the girl I fell in love with.
(lucky for you!)
                                          Yeah, if you call destiny "luck"?  üòâ
Sweet destiny.
I'm so thankful you came.
                                          I'm thankful you did too Dad.  üòâ
Your advent makes me happy.
üòä
Yes -- good point.
And the doctor's son in Vermont too !!
Did I tell you before ?
Maybe not. I don't recall right now.
Your great-grandfather was a Doctor.
Doctor Solomon.
I don't know his first name.
But your grandfather's full name was:
James Madison Solomon.
That's where my middle name ("James") came from.
                                          Thanks for telling me. I attended a Madison Junior High in North Hollywood, there's another (also James Madison, IIRC) up in Appleton off Calumet, && Madison is the capital of Wisconsin here too... and the King James (Stuart) Bible might also tie our names together pretty tightly there too. Hmm.
Hmm indeed.
Piece of Light 5b strikes again.   üòä
And Axiom #26.
                                          Yes. So regarding Axiom #26, where dew ewes top then?
Great question Pip.
Answer is:
We don't.
                                          Who do you mean by "we"?
In John 10:30 -- Yeshua said what ?
                                          I don't remember verses by numbers, but if you could please hum a few bars?
Sure.
‚ô´   ‚ô´   ‚ô´   ‚ô´   ‚ô´   ‚ô´   ‚ô´
Piece #16 has 5 sentences in it.
Could you recite the last 2 please ?
                                          It's actually pretty cool that there are notes of cantill8ion to go along with every Parshah of the Torah, and too bad that Christian music generally sucks.
                                          Yeah.
                                          "This is Heaven-School. Learn your lines, without attribution."
Yes -- my Father agrees.   He does not care much for (so called) "Christian" music.
Sorry.
You are correct.
I thought the comma was a period.
Thank you for correcting me.
So --
4 setences total.
And -- the last sentence is the one I wanted to call our attention to:
                                          IIRC, Sixpence-None-the-Richer actually made good Christian music that could be popular in the main-stream. They're probably still pretty good.
Learn your lines, without attribution.
We are on the brink of a mini-lesson on that part of Piece #16.
Shall I continue ?
                                          Please.
Ok.   Thank you.
This is about Axiom #26.
And it is linked to that last (of the 4 sentences) in Piece of Light #16.
Yeshua said a number of things that we have a written record of.
And quite a few of them were things that He said about himself.
Like  :::
I am the door.
I am the light.
I am the way.
I am the bread.
I am the proof (son).
I am the truth.
I am the show (word).
... and the list goes on and on.
And in John 10:30 -- He says something that could also go on that list --
but He leave out the "am" -- even though it is really there --
because He uses the word "are".
What He said (exactly) is:
           "I and my Father are one."
At least -- those are the 6 words we find in John 10:30.
                                          Sounds like He couldn't count very well to me.  üòâ
Anyway.   The point I wish to make here is that --
most people believe that He was saying those things
about Himself.   And they are correct.   He was.
But.   What nearly everyone misses -- is the fact
that He was "feeding" us our own lines
for our own life.
That is what Piece #16 is saying.
When Piece 16 says:
                                          I have some serious "bones-to-pick" with PoL#16.
Learn your lines, without attribution --
it is telling us not to say:
"Yeshua said ....    Yeshua said ....    Yeshua said ....    "
                                          First of all, this "life" *is* life! "Life" is *not* whatever might come *after* life!
"without attribution" means -- don't attribute a line to someone else.
Make it your own.   Own it.   Say it yourself.   About your self.
So.   Yes.   Yeshua and The Father are One.
But I also am One with The Father.
                                          There may not be any such place as Heaven (yet), which would make this life certainly not accur8 to refer to as "Heaven-School" either.
And when Angie says:  "I and The Father are One."  ==
She and The Father and Yeshua are One.
And when Tim says it -- he also is part of the One.
So.   Bottom line.   Axiom #26 is simply pressing this idea home.
End of mini-lesson.
                                          Thank you for the mini-lesson.
You're welcome for the mini-lesson.
You've always known that you are a part of me.
But -- Axiom #26 says that I am also a part of you !!
                                          If this *is* life, nobody knows what comes after, this is *not* "Heaven-School", then would anyone have lines at all to learn?
A grreat question !!
Actually -- learning effectual lines -- has nothing to do with whether we believe in a hereafter or not.
Our "lines" are merely all of our self-talk.
The things we think about our self.
The good.
And the bad.
And -- unfortunately -- most of the self-talk -- of most people --
concentrates so very much -- on the bad.
Tragic !!
Sad.
And a killer !!
                                          Why make the context of PoL#16 Heaven-School where the curriculum is learning lines which supposedly have "nothing" to do with belief in a hereafter?
                                          Seems contradictory and confusing to be couched that way.
                                          Also, how do you (or could anyone) know that any particular lines are "actually effectual" to learn? How would such be determined?
"   I, the author of Octology, have much to share through that medium, which will improve the lives of those who embrace it.   "
A person says that.
Maybe in his head.
Maybe out loud.
Maybe both.
And then -- he finds out -- that that has actually happened.
This   is proof of Octology's     efficaciality.
                                          Okay Dad. I think that might be enough chatting for me for the night. Thank you very much for all the topics we got into.
                                          I ‚ù§ you!
                                          Hopefully we can chat again next Friday evening Sabbath, July 17th, around 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime, if not sooner.
Ok.
I have 1 other "hot" item on my PCA.
                                          Okay.
But it can certainly w8.
Nice mug -- by the way.
Thank you for this nice session.
                                          Thanks. It was a gr8 gift. It's the closest I get to seeing my family.
                                          You're welcome.
I ‚ù§ you Pip.
                                          Have a good rest of your night and weekend Dad.  üòä
You too young man.   And a sOOper week too.
6'07-11-20 - 0205 Gtime / 0105 Ptime ;
# K7PMFRID:had like 7-ish-hour chat with Dad. many hours skipped to just give little tail here for now;
Is it time for my other PCA ?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
What is your favorite browser ?
FireFox.
And before that one ?
Brave.
Hmm.
Not sure I ever heard of that one.
What do you think of Chrome ?
Brave is based on Chromium code-base, I.I.R.C..
Chrome is so-so.
Why is Firefox great ?
It does every major useful browser thing I like having pretty damn well.
Ok.
Thank you.
I have been using MS-IE "forever" -- and I love it.
But more and more websites are no longer supporting it.
I'm (stubbornly) hanging on to it --
but it is clear that I am not going to be
able to for much longer.   I had hoped that --
maybe MS Edge would be a possible --
but I don't think so (really).   I've been --
experimenting with Chrome -- but there are --
quite a few things that I don't like about it.
So -- do you recommend that I try FireFox ?
Yep.
Ok.   I shall try it.
Will you be willing (and able) to answer --
my tons of questions about it ?
No. I'm no expert. I'm a fundamentals kind of coder, writing tools to write tools. I don't do browser HTML or JavaScript work much at all. Maybe WebAssembly will change things somewhat soon and enable Perl to enter the browser-code milieu. I will answer what I can.
Ok.   Thank you.
If it (FireFox) can do what IE does --
for me -- I shall be happy to go with it.
But none of the browsers I've tried --
(Chrome,  Edge,  FireFox,   Opera)  appear --
to "look" anything like IE --
which means that I'm going to --
be in for a pretty steep learning curve !!
    Not a happy prospect.
But -- all is perfect.
Thank you My Lord.
You're not perfect, but you are welcome.
And thank you for your offer to help me in my transition.
That was my last "hot" PCA for this session.
Do you wish to discuss anything else now ?
Nah. I think we've hit enough for the night. Thanks for it all.
You are (most certainly) welcome.
Nice one.   Thank you too Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
üòä
Then -- does this look like arrivederci ?
Hopefully chat with you more again next Friday evening, July 31st `d8 K7V`;
2000 G / 1900 P ?
Yep. Have a gr8 week.  ‚ù§
I will if you will.
üòä
Yeah, `d8 K7VMJ`;

üòä
And how was your week ?
Thank you for asking. I had a mostly good week. How was yours?
Good for you.
I am quite happy about mine too.
Thank you for asking.
Details on yours ?
Umm I questioned more whether there's ways to discover truths about God, love, Heaven, Hell, etc. which is a sort of ongoing quandary for me it seems.
Excellent.
Go on please.
I tidied up some code in Octology (`g3` for audio-playback) which I checked in to my GitHub repository this afternoon (along with a few other minor upd8s).
Sounds good to me.
I discovered a cool alpha-transparency ability in my audio-visualiz8ion plug-ins too, which yields a really cool revealing effect.
"discovered"  or created ?
Discovered. It has been there under my nose for a while before I recognized that it works and how cool it looks.
What does it do ?
Well I have 15 different LibVisual plug-ins which each do somewhat different but all pretty cool things.
Like ?
Running `g3 -V` to list Vis plugs yields:
0    monoscope                                  Monoscope
1   spacescope                   Stereo visualizer
2 spectrascope                   Frequency spectrum scope
3   synaescope                                 Synaescope

And besides looking cool -- you use them for what ?
My code removes any redundancies, re-orders the plug-ins into 3 distinct groups: scopes, gooms, and more official libvisual ones, and I colored all the output and I added the ability to provide just their left-most column base-64 index character instead of requiring whole plug-in names like the default.
I see.
This is good -- yes ?
They seem to be somewhat in control of themselves and able to teach me insights into what can be done... and maybe how.
Yeah.
I can try to show you. Are you receiving video?
I am.    6 boxes of "tea" at the moment.
üòä
Yeah. Visualizers are pretty cool. I think they're totally gr8!  üòä
Me too !!
Thank you for sharing.
Were you able to see some of how my text terminal can show through or not?
I was.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm still w8ing for you to install CygWin or Ubuntu so you can learn to run Octology like I do.
Are John or Danny using it yet ?
Nope. Nobody but me is clearly a routine user yet. Getting anyone else to try it out is far more difficult than I imagined.
Any progress ?
Any nibbles from anyone else ?
I made some good progress on the project, but not really with any people yet.
Well -- good on the project.
I'd also like to hear about how you are going after the people.
I don't yet know how to go after any people.
That's ok.
You will.
As you ask the right questions --
the answers will come.
          Because -- they must.
Have we discussed the "QA Dynamic" before ?
Maybe somewhat. Maybe you could please go into it further?
Sure.
The basic lesson is quite short.
Take notes please.
------------------
Most children ask tons! of questions.
Almost constantly.
To the point where they soon drive their parents nuts !!
And then -- sometime betwixt the age of --
10 and 20 -- the frequency of their "question asking" --
begins to wane.    This is not good.
And one of the reasons that Piece #11 --
puts such a "press" on it.
Children soon (in their "askeries") find that --
their parents -- and even their teachers --
do not have as many answers as they had hoped.
In fact -- parents (and teachers) will often --
tell the askers -- that "there are some things
that we just can't know".
             And this is (flatly) untrue.
And here is why --
that is untrue.
            It is         The QA Dynamic.
Answers         are not          seeded by questions.
That is:  questions do not lead    to answers.
To put "The QA Dynamic" bluntly --
         If you can ask a question -- that is evidence that the answer already exists.
---------------------
Yes.   I can say more on this --
but I shall stop here for questions or comments.
(//)
In my experience, there are plenty of questions which can be asked for which no ready answer can be presented yet.
An answer may exist, which cannot be found yet.
This is true.
And what do you do when you encounter such ?
Attempt to answer them somewhat, and figure on revisiting as opportunity and need arise.
And how does that (usually) work out for you ?
Usually well enough, it seems.
Good.
Tell me about one which it has not worked for please.
Does a real Heaven exist, and if so, how and where?
Excellent.
Of course -- you realize that that is not a question.
It is 3 questions.
I tend to do that.
And this is one of the keys to good question-asking.
Do not ask multiples together.
Sometimes they go together.
In your mind -- yes -- I fully agree.
But -- if one wants good answers --
one must use the keys to getting good answers.
You will notice that when you ask me multiples --
in a single sentence -- I (nearly always) --
break it into singles -- and address them --
separately.
The end result being -- you get your "multiple" answered --
but it comes in pieces.
This is simply "using the keys".
‚Ä¢   One question at a time.
‚Ä¢   Shorties are best.
‚Ä¢   Ask 'em on paper.
Seems stilted to me. Multiple questions can describe intention.
It IS stilted Phlip.
The keys are stilted.
But -- keys are usually the best way --
to gain entrance to locked doors.
And -- I should respond to your 2nd comment too.
     " Multiple questions can describe intention. "
I think asking multiple questions provides keys for some locked doors too.
Ok.   I shall withhold my response then.
Do what works for you.
That is always best.
Some approaches are key when working with certain constraints which people impose, or circumstances mand8... while others may work better elsewhere.
Noted.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Thanks for reminding me that short singular questions are usually best when seeking answers from you.
You're welcome Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
I ‚ù§
you too.
üòä
How is Mozilla FireFox working out for ya?
Not too well.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
You might also benefit from trying the Brave Browser as a good altern8ive too.
I shall look into that.
Thank you for the suggestion.
U R wLcome.  üòâ
/Phlip/   /Philip/      (22 minutes ago)        Sorry.
Figured it could've been just an immeD8 example of "stilted", but probably was typographical error.
lol
Yep.
Typo.
You might benefit from learning PCRE for better abilities than just what you can wrap in slashes, someday?
Have you ever burned a DVD-R disc with any Ubuntu .iso image (64-bit Desktop)? Should be pretty easy to do in any MicroSoft Windows version I'd expect, as long as you have the hardware.
I have not -- yet.
Why don't you like my `d8` 8-character stamps as much as or more than your more verbose and still 3600ths less precise than what I've got going on?
I love your d8 stamps.
Why don't you care to run d8 yourself? What do you love about them?
I love the compactness of them.
Someday others will run d8 and like it better than what they relied on earlier too.
Why do you believe that to be so ?
Because it is vastly superior in so far mostly under-appreC8d aspects. It's a model.
Ok.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Do you have anything on your PCA for tonight?
Only 1 item.
But not important.
How about you ?
Umm I guess just one here too.
Ok Pip.     Let's have it please.
What have you wanted most for this hopefully Happy Birthday of yours in under an hour from now?
New sheets for my bed.
Right on. I hope someone can get you that.
Someone did.
Thank you for your hope.
It worked !!
Nice!
üòä
Yep.
What's your PCA item?
My Lampyridae Report
Ready for it ?
I hope so.  üòä
Ok.
Here 'tis.
On Thu Jul 09 2020 - at 0142 - I saw my 1st lightning bug in many years.
And then --
On Wed Aug 05 2020 - at 2027 - I saw another one.
           End of Lampyridae Report
Cool. Maybe I can give a Lightning-Bug-Talk on Perl someday when I might try to do some live code fixing... if I ever figure out how to Octology to be used by some semblance of an audience.  üòâ
Maybe.
s/how to Octology/how to get Octology/;
I'm definitely voting for that last part.
When I was a kid -- on any summer night --
It would be gr8 to learn if you can run most of Octology within just CygWin or an Ubuntu dual-boot scenario.
we would see dozens and dozens of fireflies (Lampyridae).
It would be great.
I agree.
Do you have any reasons why Octology could not improve your computer interactions?
Give me one example please.
Maybe too much of it is so dense with patterns that it somehow leaves you with no lasting impression of what it can do for you?
Possibly so.
Tell me one thing please.
One thing it can do for me.
It can autom8 most of your eventual usage of d8 to record precise date+time stamps, wherever you could find them to be useful.
Ok.
Thank you.
I have a few questions.
You're welcome. Almost every part of Octology should do something useful.
When (what year) did you start developing Octology ?
Octology has inherited much of my old CPAN.Org code, so pretty long ago like around 2005 mainly, but the original 8.utf file which has provided the backbone for the rest of the project was started on June 27th of 2013. I developed most of it discreetly in priv8 for over 4 years (just soliciting feedback from the closest 8 people I could think of that I'd want help from to do so). After almost no feedback from anyone, I finally decided to release the project source code publicly to GitHub on October 13th of 2017, so it will have been widely available online for 3 whole years in just over 2 more months now.
Good.
Thank you.
Next question:
You're welcome. Hopefully I can get a lot done over the next year to see if its 8th year of active development can be the one which sees it take off with some small dedic8d user-base.
From 2005 to 2017 -- who did you have in mind to be using it -- as you were continuing to develop it ?
Everyone who could benefit from using computing devices proficiently, or at least competently.
Excellent.
Now.   Next question:
Why do you think that in its first 34 months (since its initial public release) it has garnered a total of zero confirmed users ?
Because I have essentially no practical awareness of how to properly crE8 a brand for the project, providing a persuasive promise to prospective users, marketing and promoting what's best about it while de-emphasizing the less-compelling aspects, etc..
Ok.
Thank you.
I haven't yet figured out anything I need to that would enable anyone else to realize how much better Octology is than not using it.
Why doesn't your Dad use it ?
I'm not sure. I think he *could* ... but is unwilling to try to for some reasons, so far.
Good answer.
Why doesn't Danny use it ?
I think he's a pretty deeply entrenched MicroSoft Windows user, and Octology is likely to run best on a GNU/Linux distribution which might appear quite foreign and unwelcoming to you, my Dad.
Danny doesn't see any value in running any of the code himself yet. His Ubuntu GNU/Linux computer already does what he wants it to, so Octology offers little to him presently. He recently remarked that he thought it was coded in Python (rather than Perl). He hasn't learned yet even the most basic aspects of my software system. Beppu-san either. Oh well. Maybe one of you will adopt some of Octology, someday.
Can you make it run on MS Windows ?
Maybe you guys have had the most and earliest chances to catch on with what Octology is becoming, but maybe others will become productive users before any of you do (for whatever reasons).
If you installed CygWin on your MS Windows, then yes, probably most of Octology should become executable for you.
Have you written a "User's Manual" for Octology ?
An even better more full-fE8ured way might be to install Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit Desktop in a dual-boot configur8ion alongside your main Windows partitions (although this route would admittedly be made a bit more difficult when needing to resize and re-alloc8 disk-drive partitions coincidentally between both of your RAID drives).
Umm not exactly any "User's Manual" has been written yet.
Why not ?
I've added basic -h parameters to the most deserving commands to output help text. They are all described uniformly by the `sumb` (SUMmarize Binaries) command. They also may contain abundant embedded document8ion which is more focused on the implement8ion details rather than end-user scenarios.
Almost all the code is executable. Each command with default and configurable output is sort of documenting its own abilities more than any classic style "User's Manual" is likely to be able to.
At what age do children begin to learn what are commonly called "computer literacy" subjects ?
I can't say that I know. I've barely spent any time around kids throughout my adult life.
Ok.
Octology is probably best used by adults first, with kids gaining such power probably somewhat l8r, after some significant matur8ion.
A person that is considered to be "computer literate" at the age of 18 -- will know how to use what particular software packages ?
As far as Octology literacy would be concerned, an adult (probably male) would know how to use almost every executable utility available within the main public repository, as well as some significant ability to write their own customiz8ions which better suit their particular needs than the defaults have been able to.
Good.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Happy Birthday Papa! I ‚ù§
you and hope you enjoy a gr8 celebr8ion of yourself today.
Thank you Philip.
That's so nice of you.
I ‚ù§
 you too.
6'08-08-20 - 0327 Gtime / 0227 Ptime
Are you off to bed?
Is it time to ?
Not necessarily. Just saw your stamp as an indic8ion that could be the case.
Nope.
Here's my d8-stamp: K88M2WP2
Ah yes.
Very nice.
Thank you.
What else would you like to chat about ?
If God turned out to be more evil than good, more deceptive than truthful, more committed to hiding than to revealing, then do you imagine you would still be inclined to side with Him for any reasons you could mention?
Well -- I'm going to treat that as a reasonable question --
and then my answer would have to be:
     in my vast experiences with Him --
     He has not turned out to be --
     any of those 3 --
     so -- I am not only ever on His side -- but --
     I am His side --
     as well as His all --
     as are also you.
I don't think I am His side or His all. Can you please explain how I might be?
Sure.
You are the living, breathing, walking, talking --
Son (proof) of Him.
     I see Him in you.
How can you be at all sure it's Him you're seeing in me? Couldn't it be just mainly me you see, or why not?
The Father is not provable.
Neither is Sis provable.
Only the Son is provable.
And there you are.
How is "not provable" different from "not existent"?
You are the Proof of God.
I look no further.
I see that you are Love.
Why do you look no further for Proof?
The Scriptures tell me that Love is God.
Ergo  :::
You are God.
I can love (probably, but I wish we'd at least use Eros, Philia, Storg, and Agape or Hebrew varE8ions to start distinguishing better what we mean by the loaded term "love")...
... but I don't think I *am* Love (UpperCased).
Agape.
It's ok.
Your mirror is cloudy.
My eye is clear.
I see the true who of you.
My love is almost always exclusive, conditional, requiring some reciprocity, etc..
What specifically do you "see" that's a truer image of who I am than I can see in mirrors?
You say you see in you --
that which I cannot.
That is your privilege.
I just does not change what I know to be true of you.
How could you know such a thing to be true though?
I am not the judge for any other than my self.
However --
If I allow any other than my self to be my judge --
I have ceased to be true to my self.
Therefore --
You are God.
I see you.
/I/  /It/
How is God God? What qualifies Him to the term? Super-human somehow? How is He seen in me?
4 Qs.
Answers follow.
#1   How is Love Love ?     English grammar answers that one.
#2   Please see answer to #1.
#3   Yes.   You are super-human.  
            You are that before you became human.
#4   He cannot help but be seen in you.   He is you.
Before Abraham was -- you am.
What makes a God different from a man? How am I super-human (regardless of whether that came about before or after I became human)?
2 more Xcellent Qs !!
#6   God is not different from a man.
        You are that man.
If God is Love and Love is God, and God is me, but I am *not* Love, nor do I seem to be particularly God-like in abilities yet, then those posited equivalencies fall apart. We're not all the same!
   Whoops.   That was #5 -- not #6.
#6   You transcend time.
       You are eternal.
Maybe those.
Good observations Pip.
The "yet" is the key.
You do not "yet" see you.
But I am only one step ahead of you.
Just far enough to turn around --
and see the true who of you.
What about your sight enables you to know it to be "true" compared to what I see in myself predominantly so far?
Another grreat Q.
Here be the answer.
#7   I have My Father's eyes.
      But -- since you do not (yet) believe in The Father --
      you do not (yet) have His eyes.
How can you have Proof for the "unprovable"?
#8   The Son is never unprovable.
       The Son (by definition) is The Proof.
Of Himself only though, logically. He's no Proof of the unprovable Father or HolySpirit.
How do the Father or HolySpirit do anything meaningful at all if they can't be proven to handle some-such meaning somehow consistently?
#9   A (perfectly) valid question.
       Answer for me this please:
       How do you (Philip / The Son) do anything meaningful at all ?
I'm a real man, who can do actual things, in the mundane physical material world. The purported Father and Spirit are of a different kind.
Xcellent Pip.
And you are of a different kind also.
Only -- you do not (yet) see it.
Even though I (already) do.
What are the fE8ures of what you "see"?
Love.
Agape.
Are you possibly seeing in me more of what you want to see in me, as opposed to what is actually a component of me which is visible and resembles your conceptual ideal somehow?
Another Xcellent Q Pip.
My Father cannot see those (according to you) part of you which are not Love.
And -- as He and I are one -- what He cannot see -- neither can I.
I insist that I don't think I'm UpperCased Love itself most of the time. I do not try or wish or endeavor to exhibit unconditional, unjustifiable, unwarranted, undeserved, impractical, unethical Agape form of "love". Lots of Philia, some Eros, minimal Storg, and almost no Agape... seems to be my primary composition.
/part/  /parts/
You get to decide what you "think" of you.
What are the contours of "Love" that you "see"?
But you do not get to decide what I (nor My Father) think of you.
Sorry Susan.
Out of your domain.
üòä
üòä
If I know myself better than either you or your Father know me though, I should be able to have some influence on what decisions you each might consider best to make.
So say you.
And that (also) is your privilege.
Yet -- such does not alter our privilege.
Right. Nobody seems to know me better than I know myself, yet.
You "seems" will change.
When "yet" becomes full-filled.
/You/  /Your/
If God were real and knew me better than I know myself, He should be able to authentic8 Himself to me unambiguously somehow and then convey what He knew that I couldn't know yet but would certainly want to know as well. A few gestures like this would go a long way to building a bridge of trust and mutual rapport, I think.
Xcellent Philip.
You w8 for He (in which you believe not) to build it.
He w8s for you to.
Could be. What appears to be each of our hold-ups building toward each other from your vantage-point?
What has He built in any serious way?
I love it.
You have been building it (the bridge) --
     for many years already.
You have been seeking.
Seeking is the construction.
This is all about Hebrews 11:6.
https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-6.htm
Of course -- the key to this verse --
is this (silly) word:  "faith".
     And what is "faith" ?
This chapter is the "Faith" chapter in the Bible.
Have you read my know.ls section on "f8h"?
And verse 1 defines the word.
https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm
https://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology/blob/master/dox/2du/know.ls from lines 257 on down to 352.
Thank you.
Yes -- I have read it before.
And I have it up right now too.
You're welcome. Yeah. I don't think "f8h" is a good thing to have or try to defend.
/read/  /readd/
I think f8h is bad. Requiring it is probably evil.
Belief without reason, holding fast to your hopes, behaving as if certain about unverifiable events... these are garbage. Refuse. Detritus.
You (Philip) believe (by unwarranted "faith") that I (your earthly Dad) am writing these lines to you.
Bloating bias into belief is berry bad.
But -- this is silly.
You have no proof that I exist.
No. I believe. Not by unwarranted "faith".
You merely choose to "believe" that I am in Pennsylvania / breathing --
and typing.
But -- you have no proof that that be so.
While I can't yet see you until you also obtain a web-cam, I believe you might be able to be persuaded to do so someday eventually.
You merely choose to believe it.
That is faith.
Choosing to believe something which you cannot see.
This would give me more confidence that my belief that I am actually sharing an online chat interface with you, my living breathing typing Dad.
Heb 11;1.
That you take time and include reasonable typographical errors and corrections and seem to correspond most with what I knew of you before we had begun chatting like this, all of these have contributed to my confidence that we are engaging with each other.
I have reason to believe that we chat almost weekly together.
I don't simply merely choose to believe it.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Faith is belief in the absence of reason, based on hopes and wishes and superstitions, primarily as far as I can tell.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
You'
Whoops.
You've got it Pip.
Carve that in stone !!
     " Faith is belief in the absence of reason, based on hopes and wishes  ",
Faith is not reason.
Faith is silly.
If I make a choice in the matter, it's the deliber8 concerted choice to limit my beliefs to things for which there's decent evidence for (i.e., reason).
As are all hopes & wishes.
But we all have "those silly things".
We each have faith.
And only each individual gets to choose --
which they hold on to --
and which they dismiss or discard.
Each God-suit is The Lord of that (individual) life.
Each one is  :::
                         God.
How is each God-suit actually just God when there's supposed to be only One (and 3) and He doesn't have any such "suit"?
How ?
I don't know how.
What makes a suit more "God" than "man"?
I only know (by my own silly faith) that that is.
Tha suit is the man.
A suit of flesh -- is -- the God-man.
The 2nd Person of God.
The Proof of God.
Your video closed.
On purpose ?
Not on purpose. The window crashed.
Oh.
It's back.
Thank you.
You're welcome. I wish you'd also invest in any USB web-cam like LogiTech which ought to work out well enough on your end too for our video-chats to be better balanced by letting each of us see (and maybe also hear) the other.
If you assume that your Father and His Holy Spirit exist, how can spirits ever interact with the material world and how can anyone be sure they're hearing from purported "spiritual" communic8ion channels directly and undisruptedly to either or both of Them? How can you tell them apart in any of your thoughts which you think must origin8 from Them?
2 more (very!) good questions Pip.
I'll be happy to answer them too.
But first --
 
Hebrews 11 is the "faith" chapter.
All 40 verses.
 
https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11.htm
 
It starts with the definition of faith --
which clearly admits that --
faith is entirely "reasonless".
 
And then goes on to cite examples of
more than a dozen "unreasonable" people
who chose to believe (be-living)
unreasonable things.
 
Among them were Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, Joseph,
Abel, Enoch, Noah, Moses,
Gideon, Samson, Samuel,
David -- many others.
 
All "silly" people.
Believing (living) in fables.
 
Hopes.
Wishes.
Dreams.
Believing in a bogus God who primarily acted in yes fables, I'm inclined to agree that sounds rather "silly" ... but also somewhat ill-advised if you're at all prepared to contend with reality as it can be experienced and navig8d.
If He's real in any important way, then recognizing this would be wholly approprE8 for whoever could though too.
Go on please.
It wouldn't just appear "silly" to hold f8h if there were tangible real-world reasons to do so.
Thank you.
Good statement Pip.
There may be survival advantages on communal levels with respect to Evolutionary Biology, which may yet persist, even if the belief can only mainly be of metaphorical truth values.
Connection to cultural heritage, tradition, ceremony, feasts, music, dance, solemnity, reverence, awe, etc. are all of course actually apparent reasons why a life of f8h can make good sense from several perspectives.
Pip's Dad agrees.
Pip just requires bodies for rel8able mutual contact and discourse to be meaningful. If this Father has no body, what can He actually do? What good could He be?
Ah ha.
But He has a body.
Yours.
Angie's.
Tim's.
How does He have my body though? What of it does He control how?
Mandy's.
Katy's.
He controls only the parts you decide that you want Him to control.
All the other parts -- are controlled by you.
You are the Lord of Him.
Is there an almost exhaustive list of these "parts" of which you speak?
He is your servant.
Yes.
Exhaustive.
Infinite.
Does every person have infinite parts?
Yep.
Infinite.
How could that be known?
lol
Do I sound like I know it ?
Probably.
Of course I do.
I designed the world.
With you.
How? When? Where?
And Angie, and Mom, and Rosie and Ginny and Dan --
all signed=off on it.
Is that weird ?
That I signed-off on Mom --
leaving me in December of 1982 ?
Yep.
Yeah. Weird. How did we design anything?
I signed off on even that !!
You designed your life.
Both the good (enjoyable) parts --
and the painful too.
Were you nuts ?
No.
Just    wise    beyond    measure    !!
Wow! That would be incredibly powerful if we all designed our lives. How could we have done so though?
I don't remember.
That was another of our incredibly wise features.
We looked over the entire plan --
and all said --
"So be it." --
and then said --
" And we shall (now) forget how we did it. "
Why ?
Wouldn't that generally be a very bad idea, forgetting something that important?
Of course --
for the joy of daily (momentary) discovery --
forever.
          We are so neat !!!
Ah. Right on, I guess.
Something rather special in d8 will occur in just under 3 hours from now, when there will be 6 simultaneous 8 digits within the stamp at K88M8888. Slightly momentous!  üòâ
More than slightly.
Is there a meaningful distinction you're able to identify which soundly demark8s me apart from your Father or His purported Son?
Not sure I completely understand the question.
Help ?
How do I differ from the Son?
You do not.
You are The Son (The Proof).
Am I the Father too?
Absolutely.
However --
you do differ from The Father.
Not in essence.
But in operation.
Whoa! How?
What you (specifically) do.
You show me things about your Godness that Angie does not show me.
Nor Tim.
Nor Mandy.
Nor Mom.
Katy.
Rosie.
And --
they each show me Godnesses that you do not.
But none of you are less (or more) God than any of the other Sons.
Ye are all proofs.
You've gotta check out this rad new S3RL video https://YouTu.be/OF-thWTJcu0
If all mankind are proofs of whatever perceived or imagined God, how do we not prove more not God if we're mainly mere menfolk && musk?
Not sure I understand that one.
Help again ?
If mankind all prove God, don't we also prove not God by being mainly just men?
I'm still not sure I've got your "drift" -- but I'm gonna try it.
We all prove God -- yes.
We all (also) prove that there are (other) spirits --
which are not God -- which (from time to time) are --
being given "way" in us --
by our own permission.
Did I answer the "right" (your intended) question ?
How are (other) spirits given "way" in us with permission?
At times -- I choose not to "be" God
That is -- not act as I know He would.
During those moment -- I am not His proof.
I have chosen to (temporarily) "step out" of my Sonship.
/moment/  /moments/
I might also add --
He (The Father) does not witness those moments.
They just leave "a hole" in my walk.
They are not recorded.
These "moments" are commonly referred to as --
"sin".
They were all fore-given.
I think it should be "sin" to amput8 any part of a new-born's genitalia.
-- before we forgot how we designed all this.
So beautiful we are.
!!
I think we'd be beautiful even without fore-giveness!
The "beauty" I am referring to here is --
the overall beauty of our design.
Although forgetting "sin" is likely to make it much harder to recognize and remember to avoid, if important. I think "sin" should be recorded too.
Our human minds record it.
But -- when our (human) skinsuit is --
amput8ed from our Spirit --
no one remembers the "sin" any longer.
This is part of the "everyone is saved" package.
No one has to do anything -- to "go" to Heaven.
Getting dipped into a lake of water does not "save" anyone.
All that man-made stuff is merely symbolic.
How could you discern "man-made" from other?
Salvation was finished (for all of us) --
before Adam began breathing.
Great question Pip.
The answer is:
Piece #11 & Piece #2.
Thank you. Many questions can be good, even if paper isn't as much for me.
Typing is essentially equivalent.
You're welcome.

And how was your week ?
Rather mixed, but the latter part has gotten mostly good. Thanks! How was yours?
I'm glad to hear that.
üòä
Quite Xcellent -- thank you for asking.
And the latter half got even gooder.
Your prayer ("hope") was very powderful !!
You said:
Not a prayer.
Hope is different. I thought we went through that.
          I hope you can discover better ways to help
          you keep better focus on more positive things
          than those that can be instead more detrimental.
And -- your "hope" (non-prayer) worked.
I found myself hearing your words in
my head all week.  And -- as your are
"My Lord" (boss) -- had to obey you.
Thank you so much.
üòä
You're welcome.
Although this is not important -- I wish to
get into it anyway.   Permiso ?
Yes.
Thank you.
Here goes.
I believe that I and My Father are One.
Am I crazy for believing that ?
Yeah.
lol
Thank you very much.
If you are not your Father, you are not "One".
My Father is (said by The Bible to be) "Love".
And -- what say you ?
Am I "Love" ?
No. Love is not a person.
Good.
Thank you.
Next Q:
What does "love" do ?
Depends.
Which "love" are you asking about?
Either agape or philia -- or both.
Are those nouns, verbs, adjectives, or something else?
Well -- in the question "What does love do ?"  --
the "love" is a noun.
Do you consider agape to be somehow "unconditional"?
I consider agape to only be conditioned (dependent)
on the qualities (or characteristics) of the donor --
not at all -- on those of the recipient.
What are those donor qualities?
Good question.
Answer:  affection for the other person.
How do you conceive of philia being different?
The "philia" love is dependent (conditioned) --
on the qualities (or characteristics) of the recipient.
Those being?
Depends.
We can ("philia") love different things (nouns).
The standard "noun" categories are:
  ‚Ä¢  people
  ‚Ä¢  places
  ‚Ä¢  things
 
Examples would be:
  ‚Ä¢  Angie Renee
  ‚Ä¢  San Luis Obispo
  ‚Ä¢  Mom's chicken kiev
Philia-love is (usually) about --
what the thought of the recipient --
does for me.
Did I answer your last question ?
Maybe not.
GOP
You seem to have indic8d that agape is only about your affection for another person, irrespective of any of their qualities. Can that one be toward noun things too, beyond just people?
I believe so.   A love for things (and places) --
although it can (also) be philia --
I can agape (love) things (and places) --
purely out of my respect for them.
For example:
The earth.
The sky.
Rivers, streams, oceans.
Of course -- this is about preserving
(not polluting) them.
Can you start that whole text over please? It doesn't rEad properly to make sense.
"A love for things -- although it can be philia -- I can agape things -- purely out of my respect for them."  What?!
Ok.  I'll try to say it a little differently.
Wait!
Ok.
I'm w8ing.
What do em-dashes ( "--" ) mean when you use them?
The quoted sentence doesn't make sense.
I usually use em-dashes to indicate "a pause in speech" --
sort of like a comma -- but a pause lonnger than a comma.
But --
In "chatting" -- I also use them at the --
end of any given line -- to indicate that --
there is more to come.
Dumb.
Ellipses are better for that.
Yes I am.
You are correct.
I do not like ellipses ... -- because --
they are not so seeable.
Or just type a whole sentence together at once, and not need either. You're communic8ion is too stilted, broken, fragmentary, and then often disjointed and fails to parse coherently.
Ok.
Thank you.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're welcome.
Do you have difficulty seeing ellipses?
I do.
Could you get glasses that would help you with that?
Probably not.   I have attempted to do so   But my vision problems are multi-typed -- and what I seem to need is something like 20x magnification and super-high contrast.
Ah. I'm sorry to hear that detailed sight is such a significant challenge for you. I hope you can discover and attain some solution to that issue ahead.
An 48-foot by 27-foot computer monitor would help.
üòä
Can you try to find a better "Magnifier" program than the default one that I think you previously indic8d was inadequ8 to meet your zooming needs?
I'd love huge displays too. Hopefully eventually we'll both become capable of acquiring enough of them to improve the amount of computer output we can clearly discern.
Yep.
So.   Tell me about your "gotten mostly good" week please.
Are you sure you want to discard the previous topics which haven't been dealt with well yet, and instead start in on my description of some of my past week?
Postpone, yes.
Are you up for sharing past week stuff now ?
Some.
Ok.                   Some is acceptable.
Thank you.
I've been thinking a lot about various descriptions of presumed to be supernatural beings and arguments for and against those and other religious, philosophical, and ethical topics.
I've also been planning and have started describing 2 new side-projects that I intend to attempt to get rolling ahead.
I've also spent a bunch of time traversing all sorts of complex assoC8ions between people, places, things, names, lyrics, games, movies, etc. often causing me to burst into uproarious laughter when striking upon various hilarious phrasings and clever meanings. Some has been poignant too. It has been interesting, challenging, sometimes quite fun, and also somewhat less frequently disturbing or concerning.
Of my plans to start 2 new projects, the first I'm thinking of calling something like "Infinite Games", which would probably become a sub-set of my main Octology project on GitHub.
It would be to develop open-source code and art assets to basically re-implement many classic arcade and home-console video-games before next summer arrives.
Sounds interesting.
My second project would be to work on developing video content for a YouTube channel which fE8ures me as "PedantPip", who meticulously breaks down arguments into even very minute details.
Ah so.
Do you (now) have a YouTube channel ?
Yes. "PipStuart" is the account name under which my existing YouTube channel can be found. I might start a sepR8 new one for "PedantPip", or just partition it under my existing one.
There are very many things I want to become particularly productive working on and toward ahead, and especially intensely hopefully throughout most of the coming Winter.
I see 9 uploads.
Is that correct ?
3 are your Pittsburgh thing.
I only see 7 on my channel. Maybe you're seeing 2 more than me somehow. Not sure why that might be occurring.
Sorry.   Yes.   I get 7 too.
2 non-Pip are interlaced.
What was your week like?
Grreat !!
Highly productive.
In all areas.
Quite moderate eating.
Very nice! Glad to hear that.
Very minimal YT movies.
Some days = 0.
I fasted one day this week.
I'm back to taking showers more often than once every 3 weeks.
That "I like myself" on my walls -- is becoming truer and truer.
I'm happy with the "past week" me.
üòä
Thank you for asking.
üòä
You're welcome.
What camera did you use on your "Darjee" YT ?
Probably the one on the back of my Samsung GalaxyS8 mobile phone.
And the same on the Garbage Pail Kids ?
Yep.
How many cameras do you have -- other than the Galaxy & the one on your computer ?
Just one other that's tiny and connects via USB, like the one connected to my main computer (Oni), just smaller and without any legs to stand. Probably pretty low quality capabilities compared with my other ones.
So -- 3 total ?
4. Phone has 2. Front is poor. Back is strong.
Ok.   Good.   4.   Thank you.
So the "Oni" one is the best ?
Maybe. The phone's back one might be somewhat better. Not quite sure yet.
You used the Galaxy-back for the 3 Darjee videos ?
Oni's one has a tripod stand and can pivot-swivel the top though, so that part might make it best regardless of the technical specs.
Probably.
And the Oni one for the 3 Pittsburgh videos ?
No. Zoom screen-capture plus Oni's main for my face in the corner.
I mean: Yeah.
Yes -- that's what I meant.
Sorry. Misreadd it.
Can you get "landscape" instead of "portrait" from the Galaxy -- or would that just capture "portrait-sideways" ?
Not sure yet. Would have to play around with it and test more.
Ok.
Just thinking about high-quality video for your upcoming YT projects.
There are tons & tons of schlock YT things out there.
Thanks. Nice of you. Yeah, I'll try to do the best I can with what I have to work with so far.
Their content is interesting -- but their lack of technical quality is very distracting.
And -- when I say "technical quality" -- I mean  ‚Ä¢  video quality (sometimes)  ‚Ä¢  audio quality (frequently)  ‚Ä¢  and other things (which we shall discuss further at the appropriate time).
Right on.
You're welcome.
Anything on your PCA ?
Not really. Was somewhat intending to mention "NfN8gAmz" and "PedantPip" new project ideas with you, which I've already done above.
s/with/to/;
Ok.   Thank you.
Are you going to ask about my PCA ?
Yes. What remains on your PCA?
Oh.  Ok.  Thank you for asking.
üòä
5 items.
2 covered.
3 remaining.
Ready for first one ?
Yes.
Okeedoke.
Thank you.
Here comes.
 
                              My Bad Clock
  
For quite a few weeks now -- my clock
stuff has been wrong.  In fact -- I had
put the subject on my PCA a couple of
weeks ago -- wanting to discuss it with
you.
However (this week) I remembered you
telling me (a while back) that some things
which I ask of you -- could (possibly)
be answered more fully by going online.
So -- Thursday evening (Sep 3) I did that.
Without sharing all the detailia -- the
bottom line is -- that my "clock stuff"
is no longer 2 minutes slow.  Sorry for
my suggesting (by my chat time-stamps)
that yours and mine didn't agree.
               It was mine that was incorrect.
üòä
(//)
It's fine. I knew that was most likely the case. Glad you could figure out how to fix yours.  üòä
Me too.   Thank you.
Ready for next item ?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
Here comes.
 
            Weather Report
 
We have had hints that September is about to arrive.
In the past 4 days -- the temp is down slightly
-- but the humidity is still rather high.
But both need to become lower before "September"
can be (officially) declared to have arriven.
H'ever.  The forcast says that tonight's low will
be in the upper 50s -- and that will be the first
time we have seen that -- since May.
In the long range forecast -- it appears that
next Friday (Sep 11 2020) will probably be
the "official" beginning of what I (generally)
call "September Weather".
 
[end of Weather Report]

Thanks.
wLcome.
3rd?
Ah yes.
I believe we have a "3" in the house.
Here comes.
 
                      Never Been To Europe
 
I've never been to Europe.
  
I've been to Hawaii (in 2008).    I gave
it to myself as my 65th Birthday Present.
And I've been to Canada -- twice.
      1958 - Niagara Falls -- with parents
      1986 - Vancouver (Expo 86) October (with me)
And I've been to Southeast Asia (1966-67)
    ‚Ä¢  Taiwan
    ‚Ä¢  Viet Nam
    ‚Ä¢  China (Hong Kong)
But -- I've never been to Europe.
Daddy was in the 1940s.  Germany I think.
Mother was.  Scandinavia (I believe).
    1980s ?           Not sure when.
But me -- never.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Back in the 80s -- I was thinking about where
I'd like to visit.  There were quite a few
places in the USA -- and by now -- I have done
many of them -- but many are yet to do.
The biggie of those is "The Henry Ford Museum"
in Michigan.  But there are a number of others
too -- like South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, and
Idaho -- which are 4 of the 6 states which I have
never been to.  The other 2 are Michigan & Alaska.
However -- also in this "where I'd like to visit"
thinkery -- (in the 80s) the 2 primes were:
  
  ‚Ä¢  Hawaii
  ‚Ä¢  Paris
  
Well.  I did Hawaii (the Island of Kauai) in October
          of 2008.  Truly "The Vacation of a Lifetime" !!
        And since then -- the "Paris" idea has
        become considerably less important.
But -- I do think about Europe from time to time.
In fact -- on Wednesday (Sep 02) -- I spent about
4 hours researching Europe stuff -- and got quite
involved in it -- especially the geography -- which
has always been a great interest to me.  ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  I've
loved geography ever since I first started studying
it in gradeschool.
And (in that "Wednesday" research) I wrote up a bunch
of stuff on European geography.  I thought maybe I'd
share it with you tonight -- but (later) thought it
would probably bore you to death.
H'ever, I will share the map with you -- because of what
I'm going to say about "where I might like to visit" --
in the remainder of this essay.  ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  Here 'tis.
 
  
     There are 45 countries in Europe.
 
And of those 45 -- there are about 6 -- which are of
some particular interest to me.  I believe I have listed
them here -- in my approximate order of interest:
 
    ‚Ä¢  Greece
    ‚Ä¢  Switzerland
    ‚Ä¢  France
    ‚Ä¢  Italy
    ‚Ä¢  UK (especially Scotland & England)
    ‚Ä¢  Ireland
 
 
Yet.  If I never get to see any of them
(while breathing) -- I shall not find
myself lamenting over that too much.
 
                        [end of essay on Europe]

Thank you.
Well I think maybe we can wrap things up for this week and probably re-connect again next Friday evening. Hope you experience another good productive week ahead.  üòä
I hope the same for you Pip.
Next Friday sounds like a plan.
Thank you for tonight.
Have I told you lately that I ‚ù§
 you ?
Well.   If not -- I ‚ù§

Keep smiling My Lord.

5'09-11-20 - 2011 Gtime / 1911 Ptime
Same to you My Lord.
üòä
How was your week ?
Umm, first I'm no "Lord". Would your "Father" approve of you referring to another as an upper-case "Lord" (or yourself as u-c "My")? It's pretty weird that you have taken to doing so. I am a man. I expect you are too. Why do you do this, and how do you justify it?
I thought I had explained this before -- but apparently insufficiently.
So -- as you are my boss -- and you have requested it -- I shall do it again.
Thank you for asking.
Here 'tis.
The word "lord" means "boss".
The capital "L" that I use -- when I apply it to you -- is simply a matter of respect for who you are -- which is quite similar to the capitalizing of the first names of any person.   If I were to address you as "pip" or "philip" -- that would seem to me to lack respect for you.
Doesn't upper-case "Lord" imply "God" though, more than merely some typical proper-noun like "Pip"?
I am aware that it is a popular notion to believe that the word "lord" is a synonym for the word "God".   But I do not see it as such.   The word "lord" simply means "boss" -- and a boss is anyone who one serves.
Thank you for clarifying that again. I struggle with the connot8ions of many things that seem somehow objectionable or disagreeable to me in their typical expressions and meanings or implic8ions and maybe also ramific8ions.
It can be an employer -- it can be a customer -- it can be a teacher's student -- it can be a family member -- it can be a friend -- this list goes on and on.
You are welcome.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
You may ask me anything.
And re-ask me whenever you wish.
I reciproc8 that sentiment, thinking probably almost no question which might occur to you should be unacceptable. I'd like for you to be and feel able to ask me anything as well.
Thank you Pip.
Thank you. If I find more to query you about it, I will ask when my next opportunity arises.
I ‚ù§
 you.
I ‚ù§
you too.
Good.
Thank you.
Okay, well I've had a rather profoundly challenging week. I've been turning over in my mind many deep thoughts about what may be appropriate to aspire for. I've also been facing some rather disturbing realiz8ions and coordin8d impositions.
GOP
I'm not sure whether I can delve into too many of the details of those matters with you yet, as I'm still needing time to mull them over further and hopefully stabilize my thinking and how I might best convey or characterize them once I've done so sufficiently.
I can say that I'm not particularly worried about them, but am needing to reflect on, and probably somewhat significantly revise, my earlier aspir8ions and intentions.
Ok
Thank you.
You're welcome.
üòä
How was your week?
Mixed.   Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.  üòä
Care to share why you found it mixed?
I shall.
Some parts were undisciplined.
H'ever -- I did spend about 20 hours on the drafting of a number of FTR Scripts.   So I was happy about that.
Well it should be usually okay to be rel8ively undisciplined some of the time. Drafting FtR Scripts for about 20 hours sounds like you've probably done some significant work though too. How do you feel about the progress you're making there, besides just being happy about it?
I feel good about the progress of drafting FTR Scripts.   It's encouraging.   The typical output of those is usually 3 or 4 per week -- which translates to about 175 per year.   And that is nice.   ¬∂   When this Covid-19 gift winds up -- and we begin to do FTR Seminar -- I shall have tons and tons of Scripts in my files.
/Seminar/  /Seminars/
The titles of the 4 Scripts done this past week were:
  ‚Ä¢  Haste & Waste
  ‚Ä¢  Satisfaction
  ‚Ä¢  Santa 2 - God 1
  ‚Ä¢  Philosophy vs Religion
 I don't know if now is the best time to bring this up, but I've spent some time reflecting on your "29 Pieces of Light" as well as the minority of "FarFar's 27 Axioms" that you've made available to me so far... and I have some concerns and complaints which might be worth discussing and addressing somewhat, if not now then probably eventually. I've also seen a powerfully moving video by James Jani contextualizing and criticizing self-help / self-development rather generally, which may also warrant some concerted engagement with at some point too. What do you think about these?
You may launch into either or both whenever you wish.   Now is fine.
Okay. Well maybe we can start with PoL#6. "FarFar's 27 Axioms" are mentioned as a single entry on your publicly published ILoveThis.Org site, but it seems unfair or unjustifiably coy or covert or something to restrict provision of these Axioms to only when you consider them to be needed, but remain unwilling to provide the whole list in its entirety for consider8ion and scrutiny and evalU8ion and dissemin8ion (if indeed they contain valuable advice, instruction, wisdom, etc.).
Would you please re-consider filling in my 14 vacancies out of the 27? I'm missing 2 through 5, 7, 9 through 13, 20, 21, 24, and 25.
Response to Paragraph #1:
Thank you.   I hear that.
Response to Paragraph #2:
Is there a particular reason to suggest to someone that they might do something that they are already doing ?
Yes. If your Pieces of Light are meant to be public, yet some of the details are kept secret or obscured, then the whole meaning, significance, context, etc. described by them is porous and partially impotent unnecessarily. Please recognize that if 29 PoL are to be taught and shared, then so too ought to be their interpret8ions and details, so that the list is comprehensible and able to be challenged and critiqued within the broader context.
On point #1 - Noted.   Thank you.
On point #2 - thank you for that observation.   I shall devote some further mullery to that.
You're welcome. In case we become unable to continue chatting online together weekly (or at all regularly over some other dur8ion), it would disappoint me substantially to have obtained only less than half of all your "Father's" Axioms. Even if you see them as merely suggestions which are pointless to share when being in regards to things they already seem to be doing, you overlook the likelihood that your codific8ion of them as a somewhat cohesive prescription for understanding and something close to idealized behavior can be useful to ponder together. They're likely prioritized somewhat. Assessing the extent of ordered significance (and other characteristics) of the completed set is an undue frustr8ion when attempting to learn more from them (or about you, or both), as well as attempting to commit them to memory and interpret and implement them in any unified fashion.
Thank you Pip.   Many of your concerns and feelings -- I (also) have had myself.   I have had to work my way through them -- and find peace -- in spite of not being given all of the information that I have requested.   Why is this ?   He has told me bits and pieces of the answer to that -- but far from all that I have asked of Him.   This (quite apparently) is a part of getting to know Him.
What about getting to know you and your Points of Light? Why include #6 as Axioms that should be "light", but that you keep in the "dark"?
Very interesting questions.   Actually -- those are 2 questions which are nearly exactly the same questions I have asked of Him.
Hmm. Well I put forth that "getting to know Him" is already difficult enough if one (like me) finds little compelling evidence that He exists or wields any formidable powers or could be worth struggling to get to know. If He has good reasons for Axioms to exist in a numbered set (of 27), then they ought not be concealed or dealt out only when they are not being followed properly. Instead they should be published and explained somewhat comprehensively, so He (and you) can become better known and respected through them (after they prove they can stand up to scrutiny, challenge, and critique). This is how I see it. Maybe you can ask Him if there's at least some good reasons to withhold them?
I have asked Him.   And (over time) I have gotten a number of answers.   Some of His answers are very clear.   Others are a bit fuzzy.   Some of His answers sit well with me.   Some of His answers tend to wrinkle my nose from time to time.   I guess the bottom line (for me -- although I am fully aware that this certainly is not the case for everyone) -- the bottom line (for me) is that I believe that He is wiser than I am -- and when He withholds this or that from me -- I believe that His doing so is not only because of His greater wisdom (than mine) -- but also that He knows how to love me -- and is loving me -- much better than I could possibly love myself.
Ah. Hmm. Well then, if He is so wise and loving you better than you could love yourself, why would He withhold valuable answers from you when you probably love yourself better by allowing yourself to access answers from yourself without the need for obscurity and mystery? Are you only assuming or having unreasonable faith that He is more wise than you and loves you better? How do you come to such odd conclusions (which they seem to be to me, so far)?
Three (3) great questions.
    Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
For the first Q -- I have no answer.
To the 3rd Q -- my answer is that My Father (among many other things) is quite odd.
To the 2nd Q -- the answer to this one can not be absolute.   It would always end up being a matter of one's opinion -- and different people would probably suggest many different answers.
Okay. Well I think inability or unwillingness to answer important questions about proper behavior and wisdom-seeking indic8s that your Father is not a good Teacher and not particularly deserving of respect or high regard. This type of responsiveness seems to me to be evidence of His conspicuous lack of inform8ion or dishonorable secrecy, which you're just expected to explain away as somehow more "wise" and "loving" while He exhibits less of these than you probably mostly already do for yourself. You seem to have lived the vast majority of your life faithful and loyal to Him, but your reward for this seems to be keeping you essentially in the dark about significant issues. I think He is a failure, if He can't answer sincere questions by His devout followers. Might you please be able to explain why you seem to be assuming that Him not answering you is exhibiting gr8r wisdom, as opposed to less of it?
Thank you for all of your comments and observations in that paragraph.
And now -- about the question ...
You're welcome.
Yes -- I believe I am able to explain it.
But I highly suspect that it would not be an "explanation" which you would be able to embrace.
Do you want me to send it anyway ?
Yes, please.
Ok.
Here goes.
There is a verse in Scripture (Rom 12:3) -- which says:  "Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought."   ¬∂   And -- this does apply to many of us -- at various times in our journey.   ¬∂   However.   It is my experience -- that the vast number of people that I have come across (in the past 77 years) -- have the very opposite problem -- which is:  they think of their "self" far (far) far! more lowly than they ought !!!   ¬∂   That is -- they either have no clue as to who (or what) they are -- or -- they refuse to eat the very truth of it -- for one or another of various different reasons (which I will not list at this moment -- but I could)   ¬∂   And -- along that same line -- I would add this:  Philippians 2:5 says: "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ (Yeshua)."   And then (in the very next verse) -- it goes on to explain that the reason that you are to embrace the idea of your having the mind of Christ is:  because you (just like Yeshua) are equal with/to God.   ¬∂   And here is the gigantic reason that Our Father ofttimes does not "flat-out" answer our questions.   He wants us to realize that His ability to "figure things out for His self" -- is resident within us.   And thereby -- the more that He "makes us" (leaves us to) "figure things out for our self" -- the more (and more) we become aware that He (and each of we) are One.

I know this is a nit-pick, but it struck me when trying to process what you've written here that: If "you are to embrace the idea of your having the mind of Christ", then unless Christ had in mind the idea of having His own mind, your mental "embracing the idea" prohibits you from having His mind. We are not equal with/to God. His mind is supposedly vast and perfect, and ours seem to almost always exhibit simplicity and flaws. Okay, now I'm moving on to "the gigantic reason" sentence.
So regarding this gigantic reason, wanting us to "realize" that us figuring things out is somehow "His ability... for His self", but how is this? Even assuming we're equal with/to God, if He remains distinct from us in any way, then we are not Him, He is not us, and thus us figuring things out is not Him doing so but primarily just us. I think there might be some minor ways in which we can be said to be "One", but in most ways, no, we are 2 or 3 different beings, entities, life-forms, etc., and not best understood to be merely "One".
And that is where you are right now.
And I applaud it.
You are perfect Philip.

I don't think I'm perfect. I also insist that I'm not equal with/to God. He and I are not "One". He has a "Chosen People", collects fore-skins from new-born baby boy's genitals, commands his people to commit genocide on heathen goyim, and instructs his people on how to properly keep slaves, handle rape, atone for sins only and always by spilling blood (including human), claims He is impossible to please without gr8 unreasonable faith, and many further atrocities. He seems overwhelmingly terrible and unethical. I am mostly good, and appear to hold higher values than Him in many regards. Maybe I'm somewhat close to perfect, while God was not and is not.
And -- you wish to "stick" to that ?
"Stick to" what?
All of those statements, ideas, conclusions, and evaluations ?
If they're mostly correct, then: "Yes!" Is there any reason I shouldn't?
Yes -- there is a reason.
You want I should "pick it apart" ?
Please.
Ok.
Here goes.
(A)  You don't believe you are perfect.  ‚Ä¢  I shall leave that one go for today.  (B)  Not God's equal  ‚Ä¢  I'll suspend comments on that one too (for now)  (C)  You and He not One.  ‚Ä¢  Can w8 too.  Now (D)  Chosen People  (E)  fore-skins  (F)  genocide  (G)  keep slaves  (H)  handle rape  (I)  sin atonement  (J)  blood spilling  (K)  many further atrocities.  ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  All 8 of these are Old Testament stuff.   And He does not support these any longer.   ¬∂   Yeshua has come to say (and show) a new way -- a New Testament  (a new system)  (a new way of being, doing, and believing) -- which are un-terrible -- and quite ethical -- very good -- and holding extremely high values -- for each (and every) one of His children.
Did you perhaps miss the part of the Old Testament where all that "stuff" was part of an "eternal covenant" with His "Chosen People" though? Jews still exist and mostly reject Y'shua for good reasons. Also Y'shua was supposedly a faultless blameless human blood sacrifice for atonement in your New Testament, which indic8s He didn't deserve to suffer and die while all of us others who are presumed to be God's children would deserve punishment but can be exoner8d just by believing Y'shua paid our penalties. This may be gr8 mercy in some sense, but I am inclined to consider justice and fairness to be higher values than those (whenever feasible, and with God they should be superior options He could have chosen). Further, Christians and even just Westerners still routinely remove new-borns' fore-skins, still believe in supposedly the same God who earlier condoned and endorsed slavery and rapists marrying their victims. If God's character and values can change so drastically from Old to New Testaments, how can you have any confidence it hasn't changed much more than before over the past 2000-or-so years? I think tons of what Christians have done throughout these past couple millennia has continue in terrible traditions, primarily by honoring hopes and faith as the basis for beliefs instead of requiring evidence and good sound reasons. Crusades, Inquisitions, persecutions, fragment8ion into incompatible denomin8ions, prohibitions against scientific findings, apologetics which almost ubiquitously presume the Bible is entirely true and trustworthy, etc.. The New Testament still gave rise to a gr8 deal of terrible activities -- unethical -- not good -- ongoingly poor values -- for each who are indoctrin8d or become otherwise convinced that they are one of God's children, while unbelievers are brow-beaten that they're going to burn in Hell for eternity. I think you're trying to paint to rosy a picture there.
s/those/mercy/; s/continue/continued/;
s/paint to rosy/paint too rosy/;
Well -- I must admit --
               God has given me a pretty rosy life.
Shall I ask Him to send you some daffodils ?
                    Mom too -- come to think of it.
Go ahead. If they arrive somehow, I guess I'll try to put them in water or wine or something.  üòâ
Whine ?
Do flowers do well in blood, or wine, or grape-juice best?  üòâ
I think so.
I did knot major in botany.
I was a microphone major.
With a microchip minor.
Right on.
üòä
Well shall we call it a night and look forward again to chatting more next Friday night on Sept. 18th?
It's a knight.
I ‚ù§
you Dad, and hope you have a good week ahead. Thanks very much for the deep topics we got into tonight.  üòä
And that sound like a plan.
And thank you for this evening.
And I ‚ù§
 you Pip.

KB7LJbcv:Copy from over a week ago:
  I appreciate you Pip.
In what way?
How much time do you have ?
This may take several hours to answer that !!
Don't know. Probably not several hours.
     Well ok.   I'll just start with a few.
If you get tired -- we can continue later.
And for the rest of our lives too.
What do I appreciate about you ?
I like chatting with you.
You have an exquisite mind.
Quite polished.
And expanding constantly.
Not many other people that I know are in that same department.
I cherish that about you.
You are kind.
You are truthful.
You are multi-faceted.
You are interesting.
You are polite.
You appreciate quality.
I love your hugs.
I like your smile.
I like your style.
I hope we'll be friends
for a long long while.
Thanks for those. I'm also challenged to define "friendship" for now. We'll see.
Ah yes -- fri-end-ship.
Well -- the "ship" suffix is way of saying "together".
It is very similar to using a "co" or "con" prefix on a word.
Means "together".
The "fri" on the front of the word "friendship" --
comes from the French "fr√®re" --
and it means "brother".
Of course the "end" in "fri-end-ship" is a no-brainer.
It means "till the end" -- which implies "forever".
So -- a "friend" (fri-end) -- is a "brother-forever".
And the "friendship" is signifying that they "sail" (travel) together.
     It's a neat word.
I like it.
üòä
But --
not nearly as much as --
     I like you.
üòä
I suspect few (if any) things are forever.
Hmm.
Another curious comment.
As I was reviewing our "last weekend" chats -- I was seeing in your comments (there) that you tend to (strongly) lean toward a belief in "forever".
Was I wrong ?
I have serious doubts this week.
Why so ?
Not sure old view can work. Well I think I am getting pretty tired now. Can we please maybe try again next week?
Sure.
Thanks.
I can easily save my PCA for then.
You are welcome Philip.
Thank you for tonight.
Maybe short -- but I enjoy you --
short or tall.
I hope you have a gooder week -- this coming.
I shall look for you on Fri Nov 06 2020 - 2000 G / 1900 P.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks. Hope you have a good week too and maybe I'll look for you also, on Nov. 6th.
You're welcome.
Great.   Thank you Pip.
