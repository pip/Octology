Hi Philip,

  Do you know what's going on?


It's a beautiful sunny day today.  Beautiful!
Reminds me of San Luis.  But it's cold.
I mean cold!  In the teens.  And winds
10 to 20 knots.  Wind chill around zero.
Brutal.  --  A week ago we were in the
60's, and breaking records.  Now, nearly
the other extreme -- not breaking records,
but cold, even for January.  The next three
days or so, we're expecting lows in the single
digits every night.
                         Tomorrow afternoon,
we're supposed to get about 3 to 6 inches of
snow.  It'll be 3.  The weatherpeople always
overdo the snow forecasts.  It's a sign
of the Times.    Do you know about
"the Times"?
                   It'll only be our 4th
snow of this winter.  We had none until

 (little 5) 1-21-05             1028                               2/20
                                                   PIP.501

January.  A dusting on the 1st.  Another
dusting about a week later.  3 inches
last weekend, and now tomorrow,
we're booked for a "giant storm":
"3 to 6 inches."
                  In the past 13 years
- since I (major) left California - I can
only remember 2 "real" snows: one
in '96 (Pennsylvania), and one in February
of 2000 (while I was "living" in New
Jersey).  Well - no one really "lives"
in New Jersey - but -- a figure of speech.
I was, thankfully, only there for 4 1/2
months.  It was long enough - almost
too long.
            A "real snow" by my
definition (for Pennsylvania) is: a foot
or more.  This ain't Wisconsin -
where it snows every 3 or 4 days
for 4 months, and it's cold for 8 1/2
or 10 1/2 months straight.  How do
people handle that?  I'll never know
and it's OK too.  I don't want to

learn that answer first-hand -- thank
you very much.  I've been to Wisconsin
once in my life - August of '59.  It
was beautiful, wonderful, and the weather
was very nice.  Of course, I'm glad
that it was the one month of the year
when you can count on not needing to
pack long undies for the jaunt in that
state.
         I was impressed by the terrain.
It truly was a beautiful place.  But,
I was there less than 24 hours - total.
Actually, I lie.  I was there twice.
Once on the way.  Once on the way
back.  A little vacation to visit my
uncle in North Dakota.  My Mother
drove it from Pennsylvania in a blue
1951* Dodge Pick-up Truck.  I
thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I guess
the 2 fondest memories of it were:
hearing "Born Too Late" by the
Pony Tails on the radio in Minneapolis;
and #1 (memory) had to be: driving

Uncle Thurman's 1955 Oldsmobile (4-door
sedan, automatic "Hydraglide" transmission) in
and out of his driveway, over and over and
over and over again.  --  I did not
have a license.  Though I had just turned
16 that August (and 16 was the legal driving
age in PA), my parents didn't allow me
to apply for my learner's permit until
June of 1961 - when I graduated from
high school, and was just 2 months
shy of my 18th birthday.
                            But,
Uncle Thurman said, "In my driveway,
it's legal - because I own the property."
I said, "Great!"  Thank you.

I always called him my favorite uncle.
Not that my other one (Uncle Jack)
wasn't nice - he was, very.  But
UJ was "ordinary."  He worked at
one place for 40 years -- high school
to retirement -- or was it 44 years maybe.
Yes.  I liked him too.  He was always

 (little 5) 1-21-05             1106                               5/20
                                                   PIP.501

very nice to me, and down to earth.
But his lifestyle did not inspire me
like UT.  Uncle Thurman was a pilot
in his younger days; and then, when
his ears developed problems (from / when
flying) he went into the newspaper
business.  You see - both of his
careers were more glamorous - and
enticing (inspiring) - than being a
box maker :  Uncle Jack worked
at Continental Can.  They made
(primarily) cardboard containers -
about 2 or 3 feet in diameter -
around 4 feet high.  A rather
necessary product, but it didn't
roll my blood much to think of
it as a life penchant.
                         I can't
remember a time when I didn't
want to fly.  - And in November
of '84, I finally did it (almost).
Well.  I did.  Really.  But I
say "almost", because I ran

 (little 5) 1-21-05             1118                               6/20
                                                   PIP.501

out of the money for flying lessons
about 3 or 4 hours short of
solo-ing.  Ergo: I have 13
hours in my logbook, and I
passed the written exam, but
I never got my license - because
I never soloed.  Yet, I (mostly)
fulfilled the dream.  I <u>did</u> learn
to fly.  - And I love it.

I still very much remember it.  It
was everything I ever imagined it
would be - and more.  And even
today, I still yearn for a plane, the
same one I wanted back then - the
Cessna Citation.  In fact, I have the
Bravo (which is the current-day version
of the one I wanted in 1984) as my
computer wallpaper <s>currently</s> prsently.

But in March of '58 - <u>that</u> was
a snowstorm!  19 inches.*  Wet.
Heavy.  Messy.  And we were out

* over 2 feet in some areas

 (little 5) 1-21-05             1128                               7/20
                                                   PIP.501

of school for 7 days.  That's 7
school days.  So it was a total of 11
<s>of 9</s> days off.  I remember it
well.  Everything stopped.  Nothing
moved for about 3 days.  Electricity
was out nearly everywhere.  The
wet, heavy snow clung to the wires
and brought many of them down.
I and my parents moved in with my
grandparents for a few days, as we
had an oil furnace, which required
electricity to run it; but they had a
coal furnace, which ran just
fine - by shovel.
                      The snow
hit late on Saturday night.  I was
27 miles out of town on a weekend
retreat with my youth group from
church - in Norristown.  When we
woke up Sunday morning, everything
was white.  Very white.  And it
was snowing like crazy.  Huge
white flakes.  And straight down.

 (little 5) 1-21-05             1139                               8/20
                                                   PIP.501

Very heavy.  And very quiet.  The
family I was staying with said not
to worry.  That I was welcome to
stay as long as it took.  --  We
were supposed to go back (home) Sunday
evening.  But it sure didn't look like
that was going to be even a remote
possibility.  It was so quiet outside.
No cars.  No snow plows.  Nothing.
Except a few people walking.  No
one bothered to shovel it.  It was
pointless.  If you tried to, by the
time you got the second 10 feet done,
the first 10 feet (that you just did)
was totally covered again.  People
just sat by their windows and watched
it.  It was beautiful to watch.  It
didn't blow.  It didn't drift.  Just
straight down.  Giant flakes.  You
could nearly see the level rise as
you watched.
             We went over to the
church.  It was only 2 blocks,

 (little 5) 1-21-05             1150                               9/20
                                                   PIP.501

and it was so great!  Very much
a party atmosphere.  I mean, the
retreat was a treat to begin with,
but the idea - actually, much more
than an idea - it was a surety -
of getting snowed in, and having an
extended stay with <s>out</s>our many new-found
friends, was nothing short of a pure
delight!
           Delightful!  Yes.  Very.
I finally did get home (to Birdsboro).
But I will fondly forever remember
Norristown as a town of friends, fun,
and white!
            And then.  Back home -
for a week - I went sledding - and
met Dr. Finley's daughter.  I was
14 (9th grade); she was 12 (7th grade).
I can't remember if I ever saw her
again.  But some things just stick in
your mind.

Well.  I stand corrected.  The snow that we were supposed
to get on Saturday (1-22-05, that I mentioned on page 1.6)
turned out to be 6.8 inches.  Sometimes, the <u>are</u> right.

 (little 4) 5-19-05             1453                              10/20

Greetings Philip,

  I guess it's about time I get this thing in
the mail - this letter that I started 4 months
ago - back in January.

Yes.  I received your
  10-page typed     letter (DAD-406) on (little 3) 11-17-04 1621
      and your
   1-page hand done letter (DAD-501) on (little 2)  1-25-05 0727

Just for future reference,, customarily, a 10-page
letter in a #10 envelope requires 2 stamps:
a 37c, and a 23c.  Generally, it works
out like this: An 8 1/2 x 11 piece of 20-lb
bond paper weighs about .17 ounces.  A #10
envelope weighs circa .12 ounces.  Therefore,
a 5-page letter is the max that will go
in a #10 envelope for the 1-ounce rate
of 37c - because .17 x 5 = .85
plus .12 = .97 (just a hair under one
ounce).

 (little 4) 5-19-05             1513                              11/20
                                                   PIP.501

You asked in DAD-501 whether you should
send me a pen.  The answer is "yes/if."

Pens I got.  The right one, not really.

One Thing I find as my history (read: "years")
advance(s) is that I cannot replace many
of the commodities that I've become accustomed
to using, when they wear out.
                               Some manufacturers
just go out of business.  Others discontinue the model
that I previously purchased.  Do they do it because
the older one was not well designed?  No -
I think not.  I believe it is driven by their watching
the releases of the competition.  I find this
somewhat amusing - albeit also frustrating.

Let's take for instance - the pen.  In the 1950's
there were essentially 3 pen manufacturers (at least,
that the average person could name): PaperMate,
Parker, and Cross.  Don't make book on what
I'm about to say, as it's only based on my
personal perception - not on actual research.

 (little 4) 5-19-05             1527                              12/20
                                                   PIP.501

Parker was an old company.  They made their
name back in the days of fountain pens
- do you even know what that is?
Maybe not.  Back in Ben Franklin's time,
people wrote with quill pens.  That is,
they would take <s>the</s> a tail feather from a
porcupine or hedgehog, which at it's base
was a hollow cylinder, and cut it off at
an angle, thereby producing a point.  They
would then dip it into a bottle of ink, and
when pulling it out it retained about
enough ink to write maybe 4 or 5 words.
Then you'd dip again, and so forth.
Just to show you how old I am -
when I was in grade school (1949 to
1955) our desks actually were made
with a hole in them... a hole for to
hold the ink bottle.  I the lower
grades, we wrote with a #2 or #2 1/2
yellow Dixon pencil.  But by 4th grade,
we had graduated to the dip, dip, dip,
pen procedure.  But the tip was not from
a bird's feather.  By then, they were being
made from steel.  I believe that type of

 (little 4) 5-19-05             1545                              13/20
                                                   PIP.501

pen may still be available at art stores.
Not sure.
            Anyway.  By junior high school
(1955-1958), we had then advanced to using
fountain pens.  The ink was still very liquid,
but you didn't dip every 5 words.  You
would pull a little lever on the side of the
fountain pen, and it would <s>it</s> depress a rubber
sack inside the barrel.  Then, you dip the
pen point (which now was engineered with
a hollow tupe as a part of it) into the ink
bottle.  Then, you would lower the lever,
which would cause the sack inside the
pen to re-inflate, which would suck up
a load of ink into the sack.
                                  This
would be good for hundreds - maybe
a couple thousand words.  A few years
later, one of the pen makers dumped the
lever on the side, and gave you a plastic
ink cartridge to simply insert in the barrel
of the pen.  Ergo.  End of ink bottle.
End of hole-in-desk.  And.  Before

 (little 4) 5-19-05             1558                              14/20
                                                   PIP.501

long, black was not the only color available.
First there was blue/black (a very, very, dark
blue - darker even than navy).  And then came
red, and then a real blue.  And then other
colors too.  I remember in 10th grade
(1958-59), as teenagers are all trying to
establish their "identities", my friend
George Sohn wrote with purple; I with
green.
        So.  That's a fountain pen.  I
believe they still make 'em.  But I
can't imagine for whom.
                          I'm guessing
the ball-point pen probably came out in
the late '50's.  At any rate, by very
early in the 1960's, I had discovered
one made by PaperMate.  In those days,
if you asked anyone who makes ballpoint
pens, that was the name that would be
uttered.  Of course, today, PaperMate, and
Parker, and Cross, and a zillion others, all
make ball-points - but back then, P.M.
owned the market.
                       And in the early

 (little 4) 5-19-05             1609                              15/20
                                                   PIP.501

'60's they came out with a model they called
the "150."  Not a very catchy name, but
it sold well - and was priced at one dollar
and fifty cents.  Ah-ha.  It<s>'</s>s name source
is now <s>rel</s> revealed.  Did it sell well
because it was cheap?  No, I think not.
Many other ballpoints of that day sold for
$1.29 or $1.39.  It was the first pen
I ever saw which was ergonomically
designed.  Instead of the barrel tapering
down completely to the tip, it had a
little lip to keep your fingers from sliding
toward the point.  I thought it was great.
And I bought one.  And apparently, so
did many others.  It sold VERY well.
PaperMate became the owner of the ballpoint
pen market.  And... well, let's cut to
the chase.
             Yes.  You used cartridges in this
pen.  A refill is good for about 25,000 words
today.  (That's about 125 pages, at least, the way
I write.)
           It's a great pen.  Not indestructible.
But pretty well engineered.  But they wanted to

 (little 4) 5-19-05             1622                              16/20
                                                   PIP.501

keep it inexpensive, so they didn't correct
the things that I would call "flaws."

And every 5 or 10 years, I would buy another
one.  Well, with inflation and all, the
price started to rise.  Not exorbitantly, but
nevertheless - it went up.  Of course, Paper
Mate quickly realized the "150" name
was not very appropriate anymore.  They
renamed it the "Contour" - which I
thought made pretty good sense.
                                  In 1995,
I bought 2 of them, one with a dark blue
barrel, with a blue refill; and one with a
red barrel, in which I put a red refill.  At
that time, I believe I paid $5.95 for each
pen - a very appropriate cost for a simple
retractable ball point pen of its day.

And then some "bad" stuff began to happen.
(#1) P.M. stopped making red refills.  For
a year or so, I got one from Eversharp that
fit it, but in a few years, even they stopped

 (little 4) 5-19-05             1633                              17/20
                                                   PIP.501

offering red refills.  Today, refills come in
blue and black - and that's all.  <u>Nobody</u>
makes a red refill anymore.  If you want
to write red, you have to use a 10c pen
- it's called a Bic.  (Others make 'em too
- even PaperMate.)  But they're a standard
cheapy throwaway pen.  Not refillable.  Not
retractable.  Not a decent pocket-clip.  Oh
well.
      (#2) PaperMate was acquired by Gillette
(a razor company!)
      (#3) The "Contour" was discontinued.
This was not good.  The casing is made of
plastic.  After 8 years* of daily use, the
upper barrel has cracked.  I need a
new one.  No gots, no where, in
the marketplace.
                   A number of pen
makers have appropriated the "contour"
idea, but they make it of rubber (yuck)
and entirely too fat for human fingers
(double yuck!).
                                 So.
* this happened 2 years ago

If you find an old PaperMate Contour, in
serviceable condition, <s>f</s>preferably with a
dark blue barrel - but I'll accept any color
- get it for me - and yes, send me
that pen.
            When I become King, I
will issue and edict that the old PaperMate
drawings be recovered, and the Contour put
back in production - and with the flaws
corrected, and sold for about $18.

I've readd your 4B6 ( (little 6) 11-6-04)(DAD-406)

just went through it again now.  A

We all tend to think "no one could
possibly be as messed up as I am!"
But it just ain't true.  The average
person simply does not share their
darkest demons with <u>anyone</u>.  You
are quite normal.  I'd say, in many
respects, considerably more well-adjusted
than most.
            Affirm that position, and
its firmness <s>with</s>will grow.  Don't permit
thoughts like "I must be nuts." to
linger.  "I am happy.  I am healthy.

you - much gooder.

                  I have one* question.
www.boyertownmuseum.org  Do you have
any comments for me?  Have you
visited?  Is anything of interest?
Good?  Lousy?  Improvable?
Whatever?
              I love you Philip
