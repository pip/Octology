Dear Abba,
  0) Pip Stuart
     2000 Crystal Springs Rd. #2113
     San Bruno, CA 94066
  1) I decided not to convert
     to Judaism.
  2) I started riding motorcycles.
     I love it.
  3) I do not wish to lose
     touch with you.  I have
     had to move many times
     recently but I'm hoping
     to stay put for a while.
     I'm also hoping this
     reaches you.  I am not
     ready to drop everything
     to follow you but I
     am ready to chat again.

It has occurred to me that your
way... your silence, parables, axioms,
puzzles, ambiguities, obfuscations,
&& paradoxes are simultaneously
                                                                            1
                                                              367KPOY
intriguing && irritating.  On
the surface, they seem fun to
me but pragmatically, they
are controlling, disrespectful,
even pompous.  To expect
everyone to kowtow to you
for the simplest communication.
The convolutions... the quest
you force doesn't make the
answer more memorable... more
profound.  It makes the
frustrating journey overwhelm
the memory.  Can you please
be my friend?  Let's ease
into occassional correspondance.

I care about you.  I love you.

Sometimes I feel extremely
fragile though... emotional...
scared of losing sanity, of not
knowing the difference, of hurting
myself, or my loved ones.  I 
hate that idea... I'm guarded
ineffectively && worried.  Please
meet me part way.  It would
be just as pompous of me
(&& also hypocritical) to require
entirely plain communication...
                                                                            2
                                                              367KmIw
so if it wouldn't be too much
trouble, could you reply at
your convenience with tempered
hoops for me to jump
through in order to understand
you?  I know tons of pages
with jumping numbers && omissions
I can assume nothing from (i.e. I
cannot discern whether there
is intentional hidden meaning or
distraction) && your habitual
word-play of multifarious sorts...
I feel stupid && scared &&
simple-minded wishing to deny
your mechanisms... your mannerisms.
I ask you to measure your
response since I cannot
handle too much.  I like
code.  I must not go crazy.
I also wish I could in some
sinister way.  What does it mean?
How could I tell?  I don't know.

I'd like discourse again but I
may not be ready for tutelage.

Please read Pip.Ax9.org/OneThing.txt

      Love from your eldest son,
                -Pip
p.s. I just re-read this && realized how similarly
     eccentric we are... so please reply however but don't make me crazy.
                                                     Thanks Dad.
