As far as Octology literacy would be concerned, an adult (probably male) would know how to use almost every executable utility available within the main public repository, as well as some significant ability to write their own customiz8ions which better suit their particular needs than the defaults have been able to.
Good.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Happy Birthday Papa! I ‚ù§
you and hope you enjoy a gr8 celebr8ion of yourself today.
Thank you Philip.
That's so nice of you.
I ‚ù§
 you too.
6'08-08-20 - 0327 Gtime / 0227 Ptime
Are you off to bed?
Is it time to ?
Not necessarily. Just saw your stamp as an indic8ion that could be the case.
Nope.
Here's my d8-stamp: K88M2WP2
Ah yes.
Very nice.
Thank you.
What else would you like to chat about ?
If God turned out to be more evil than good, more deceptive than truthful, more committed to hiding than to revealing, then do you imagine you would still be inclined to side with Him for any reasons you could mention?
Well -- I'm going to treat that as a reasonable question --
and then my answer would have to be:
     in my vast experiences with Him --
     He has not turned out to be --
     any of those 3 --
     so -- I am not only ever on His side -- but --
     I am His side --
     as well as His all --
     as are also you.
I don't think I am His side or His all. Can you please explain how I might be?
Sure.
You are the living, breathing, walking, talking --
Son (proof) of Him.
     I see Him in you.
How can you be at all sure it's Him you're seeing in me? Couldn't it be just mainly me you see, or why not?
The Father is not provable.
Neither is Sis provable.
Only the Son is provable.
And there you are.
How is "not provable" different from "not existent"?
You are the Proof of God.
I look no further.
I see that you are Love.
Why do you look no further for Proof?
The Scriptures tell me that Love is God.
Ergo  :::
You are God.
I can love (probably, but I wish we'd at least use Eros, Philia, Storg, and Agape or Hebrew varE8ions to start distinguishing better what we mean by the loaded term "love")...
... but I don't think I *am* Love (UpperCased).
Agape.
It's ok.
Your mirror is cloudy.
My eye is clear.
I see the true who of you.
My love is almost always exclusive, conditional, requiring some reciprocity, etc..
What specifically do you "see" that's a truer image of who I am than I can see in mirrors?
You say you see in you --
that which I cannot.
That is your privilege.
I just does not change what I know to be true of you.
How could you know such a thing to be true though?
I am not the judge for any other than my self.
However --
If I allow any other than my self to be my judge --
I have ceased to be true to my self.
Therefore --
You are God.
I see you.
/I/  /It/
How is God God? What qualifies Him to the term? Super-human somehow? How is He seen in me?
4 Qs.
Answers follow.
#1   How is Love Love ?     English grammar answers that one.
#2   Please see answer to #1.
#3   Yes.   You are super-human.  
            You are that before you became human.
#4   He cannot help but be seen in you.   He is you.
Before Abraham was -- you am.
What makes a God different from a man? How am I super-human (regardless of whether that came about before or after I became human)?
2 more Xcellent Qs !!
#6   God is not different from a man.
        You are that man.
If God is Love and Love is God, and God is me, but I am *not* Love, nor do I seem to be particularly God-like in abilities yet, then those posited equivalencies fall apart. We're not all the same!
   Whoops.   That was #5 -- not #6.
#6   You transcend time.
       You are eternal.
Maybe those.
Good observations Pip.
The "yet" is the key.
You do not "yet" see you.
But I am only one step ahead of you.
Just far enough to turn around --
and see the true who of you.
What about your sight enables you to know it to be "true" compared to what I see in myself predominantly so far?
Another grreat Q.
Here be the answer.
#7   I have My Father's eyes.
      But -- since you do not (yet) believe in The Father --
      you do not (yet) have His eyes.
How can you have Proof for the "unprovable"?
#8   The Son is never unprovable.
       The Son (by definition) is The Proof.
Of Himself only though, logically. He's no Proof of the unprovable Father or HolySpirit.
How do the Father or HolySpirit do anything meaningful at all if they can't be proven to handle some-such meaning somehow consistently?
#9   A (perfectly) valid question.
       Answer for me this please:
       How do you (Philip / The Son) do anything meaningful at all ?
I'm a real man, who can do actual things, in the mundane physical material world. The purported Father and Spirit are of a different kind.
Xcellent Pip.
And you are of a different kind also.
Only -- you do not (yet) see it.
Even though I (already) do.
What are the fE8ures of what you "see"?
Love.
Agape.
Are you possibly seeing in me more of what you want to see in me, as opposed to what is actually a component of me which is visible and resembles your conceptual ideal somehow?
Another Xcellent Q Pip.
My Father cannot see those (according to you) part of you which are not Love.
And -- as He and I are one -- what He cannot see -- neither can I.
I insist that I don't think I'm UpperCased Love itself most of the time. I do not try or wish or endeavor to exhibit unconditional, unjustifiable, unwarranted, undeserved, impractical, unethical Agape form of "love". Lots of Philia, some Eros, minimal Storg, and almost no Agape... seems to be my primary composition.
/part/  /parts/
You get to decide what you "think" of you.
What are the contours of "Love" that you "see"?
But you do not get to decide what I (nor My Father) think of you.
Sorry Susan.
Out of your domain.
üòä
üòä
If I know myself better than either you or your Father know me though, I should be able to have some influence on what decisions you each might consider best to make.
So say you.
And that (also) is your privilege.
Yet -- such does not alter our privilege.
Right. Nobody seems to know me better than I know myself, yet.
You "seems" will change.
When "yet" becomes full-filled.
/You/  /Your/
If God were real and knew me better than I know myself, He should be able to authentic8 Himself to me unambiguously somehow and then convey what He knew that I couldn't know yet but would certainly want to know as well. A few gestures like this would go a long way to building a bridge of trust and mutual rapport, I think.
Xcellent Philip.
You w8 for He (in which you believe not) to build it.
He w8s for you to.
Could be. What appears to be each of our hold-ups building toward each other from your vantage-point?
What has He built in any serious way?
I love it.
You have been building it (the bridge) --
     for many years already.
You have been seeking.
Seeking is the construction.
This is all about Hebrews 11:6.
https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-6.htm
Of course -- the key to this verse --
is this (silly) word:  "faith".
     And what is "faith" ?
This chapter is the "Faith" chapter in the Bible.
Have you read my know.ls section on "f8h"?
And verse 1 defines the word.
https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm
https://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology/blob/master/dox/2du/know.ls from lines 257 on down to 352.
Thank you.
Yes -- I have read it before.
And I have it up right now too.
You're welcome. Yeah. I don't think "f8h" is a good thing to have or try to defend.
/read/  /readd/
I think f8h is bad. Requiring it is probably evil.
Belief without reason, holding fast to your hopes, behaving as if certain about unverifiable events... these are garbage. Refuse. Detritus.
You (Philip) believe (by unwarranted "faith") that I (your earthly Dad) am writing these lines to you.
Bloating bias into belief is berry bad.
But -- this is silly.
You have no proof that I exist.
No. I believe. Not by unwarranted "faith".
You merely choose to "believe" that I am in Pennsylvania / breathing --
and typing.
But -- you have no proof that that be so.
You merely choose to believe it.
While I can't yet see you until you also obtain a web-cam, I believe you might be able to be persuaded to do so someday eventually.
That is faith.
Choosing to believe something which you cannot see.
This would give me more confidence that my belief that I am actually sharing an online chat interface with you, my living breathing typing Dad.
Heb 11;1.
That you take time and include reasonable typographical errors and corrections and seem to correspond most with what I knew of you before we had begun chatting like this, all of these have contributed to my confidence that we are engaging with each other.
I have reason to believe that we chat almost weekly together.
I don't simply merely choose to believe it.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Faith is belief in the absence of reason, based on hopes and wishes and superstitions, primarily as far as I can tell.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
You'
Whoops.
You've got it Pip.
Carve that in stone !!
     " Faith is belief in the absence of reason, based on hopes and wishes  ",
Faith is not reason.
Faith is silly.
If I make a choice in the matter, it's the deliber8 concerted choice to limit my beliefs to things for which there's decent evidence for (i.e., reason).
As are all hopes & wishes.
But we all have "those silly things".
We each have faith.
And only each individual gets to choose --
which they hold on to --
and which they dismiss or discard.
Each God-suit is The Lord of that (individual) life.
Each one is  :::
                         God.
How is each God-suit actually just God when there's supposed to be only One (and 3) and He doesn't have any such "suit"?
How ?
I don't know how.
What makes a suit more "God" than "man"?
I only know (by my own silly faith) that that is.
Tha suit is the man.
A suit of flesh -- is -- the God-man.
The 2nd Person of God.
The Proof of God.
Your video closed.
On purpose ?
Not on purpose. The window crashed.
Oh.
It's back.
Thank you.
You're welcome. I wish you'd also invest in any USB web-cam like LogiTech which ought to work out well enough on your end too for our video-chats to be better balanced by letting each of us see (and maybe also hear) the other.
If you assume that your Father and His Holy Spirit exist, how can spirits ever interact with the material world and how can anyone be sure they're hearing from purported "spiritual" communic8ion channels directly and undisruptedly to either or both of Them? How can you tell them apart in any of your thoughts which you think must origin8 from Them?
2 more (very!) good questions Pip.
I'll be happy to answer them too.
But first --
 
Hebrews 11 is the "faith" chapter.
All 40 verses.
 
https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11.htm
 
It starts with the definition of faith --
which clearly admits that --
faith is entirely "reasonless".
 
And then goes on to cite examples of
more than a dozen "unreasonable" people
who chose to believe (be-living)
unreasonable things.
 
Among them were Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, Joseph,
Abel, Enoch, Noah, Moses,
Gideon, Samson, Samuel,
David -- many others.
 
All "silly" people.
Believing (living) in fables.
 
Hopes.
Wishes.
Dreams.
Believing in a bogus God who primarily acted in yes fables, I'm inclined to agree that sounds rather "silly" ... but also somewhat ill-advised if you're at all prepared to contend with reality as it can be experienced and navig8d.
If He's real in any important way, then recognizing this would be wholly approprE8 for whoever could though too.
Go on please.
It wouldn't just appear "silly" to hold f8h if there were tangible real-world reasons to do so.
Thank you.
Good statement Pip.
There may be survival advantages on communal levels with respect to Evolutionary Biology, which may yet persist, even if the belief can only mainly be of metaphorical truth values.
Connection to cultural heritage, tradition, ceremony, feasts, music, dance, solemnity, reverence, awe, etc. are all of course actually apparent reasons why a life of f8h can make good sense from several perspectives.
Pip's Dad agrees.
Pip just requires bodies for rel8able mutual contact and discourse to be meaningful. If this Father has no body, what can He actually do? What good could He be?
Ah ha.
But He has a body.
Yours.
Angie's.
Tim's.
How does He have my body though? What of it does He control how?
Mandy's.
Katy's.
He controls only the parts you decide that you want Him to control.
All the other parts -- are controlled by you.
You are the Lord of Him.
Is there an almost exhaustive list of these "parts" of which you speak?
He is your servant.
Yes.
Exhaustive.
Infinite.
Does every person have infinite parts?
Yep.
Infinite.
How could that be known?
lol
Do I sound like I know it ?
Probably.
Of course I do.
I designed the world.
With you.
How? When? Where?
And Angie, and Mom, and Rosie and Ginny and Dan --
all signed=off on it.
Is that weird ?
That I signed-off on Mom --
leaving me in December of 1982 ?
Yep.
Yeah. Weird. How did we design anything?
I signed off on even that !!
You designed your life.
Both the good (enjoyable) parts --
and the painful too.
Were you nuts ?
No.
Just    wise    beyond    measure    !!
Wow! That would be incredibly powerful if we all designed our lives. How could we have done so though?
I don't remember.
That was another of our incredibly wise features.
We looked over the entire plan --
and all said --
"So be it." --
and then said --
" And we shall (now) forget how we did it. "
Why ?
Wouldn't that generally be a very bad idea, forgetting something that important?
Of course --
for the joy of daily (momentary) discovery --
forever.
          We are so neat !!!
Ah. Right on, I guess.
Something rather special in d8 will occur in just under 3 hours from now, when there will be 6 simultaneous 8 digits within the stamp at K88M8888. Slightly momentous!  üòâ
More than slightly.
Is there a meaningful distinction you're able to identify which soundly demark8s me apart from your Father or His purported Son?
Not sure I completely understand the question.
Help ?
How do I differ from the Son?
You do not.
You are The Son (The Proof).
Am I the Father too?
Absolutely.
However --
you do differ from The Father.
Not in essence.
But in operation.
Whoa! How?
What you (specifically) do.
You show me things about your Godness that Angie does not show me.
Nor Tim.
Nor Mandy.
Nor Mom.
Katy.
Rosie.
And --
they each show me Godnesses that you do not.
But none of you are less (or more) God than any of the other Sons.
Ye are all proofs.
You've gotta check out this rad new S3RL video https://YouTu.be/OF-thWTJcu0
If all mankind are proofs of whatever perceived or imagined God, how do we not prove more not God if we're mainly mere menfolk && musk?
Not sure I understand that one.
Help again ?
If mankind all prove God, don't we also prove not God by being mainly just men?
I'm still not sure I've got your "drift" -- but I'm gonna try it.
We all prove God -- yes.
We all (also) prove that there are (other) spirits --
which are not God -- which (from time to time) are --
being given "way" in us --
by our own permission.
Did I answer the "right" (your intended) question ?
How are (other) spirits given "way" in us with permission?
At times -- I choose not to "be" God
That is -- not act as I know He would.
During those moment -- I am not His proof.
I have chosen to (temporarily) "step out" of my Sonship.
/moment/  /moments/
I might also add --
He (The Father) does not witness those moments.
They just leave "a hole" in my walk.
They are not recorded.
These "moments" are commonly referred to as --
"sin".
They were all fore-given.
I think it should be "sin" to amput8 any part of a new-born's genitalia.
-- before we forgot how we designed all this.
So beautiful we are.
!!
I think we'd be beautiful even without fore-giveness!
The "beauty" I am referring to here is --
the overall beauty of our design.
Although forgetting "sin" is likely to make it much harder to recognize and remember to avoid, if important. I think "sin" should be recorded too.
Our human minds record it.
But -- when our (human) skinsuit is --
amput8ed from our Spirit --
no one remembers the "sin" any longer.
This is part of the "everyone is saved" package.
No one has to do anything -- to "go" to Heaven.
Getting dipped into a lake of water does not "save" anyone.
All that man-made stuff is merely symbolic.
How could you discern "man-made" from other?
Salvation was finished (for all of us) --
before Adam began breathing.
Great question Pip.
The answer is:
Piece #11 & Piece #2.
Thank you. Many questions can be good, even if paper isn't as much for me.
Typing is essentially equivalent.
You're welcome.
Thank you for your comment.
You're welcome.
So how best does God manifest as servant for people && how ought we serve Him too?
2 good questions Pip.
I'm going to do the second first.
How ought we serve Him ?
In a very large way -- we cannot "serve" God.
The idea of "serving" God suggests that there is --
something that we can give to Him --
which He does not already possess.
Very! unfortunately -- most (if not all) organized --
"religions" (heavily) tend to perpetuate the --
idea that we should "serve" God (The Father).
This (then) tends to revolve around the --
spending an hour (or 2) per week --
inside a stonepile -- where we go through --
various (mostly very silly, and fruitless) --
exercises -- which He finds nearly totally --
empty, useless, and debilitating.
He only wants 2 things from us (for Himself) --
and we cover those in another lesson.
But --
how then are we to "serve" Him ?
We are not to serve The Father.
We are encouraged to serve The Son.
Ah. Hmm.
Which means:  serve (give to) our brothers --
and sisters -- who also are God (The Son).
Does that (pretty much) answer that one ?
Maybe. I think I had misconceptions clouding things.
How so ?
Well now also considering serving brethren && sisters, some are more like the supposed Son than others. But that the Father had things right is largely wrong, but dissonant contrasting expect8ions && claims.
Thank you.    I'll come back to that comment shortly.
But first --
By the way -- this which I just answered is Mt 22:39 --
which Yeshua listed as the 2nd of the 2 most important
commandments of all.    It essentially says that our
"neighbors" are our self -- and we should love (give to)
"them" -- knowing that by doing so -- we are truly giving
to (loving) our self.
 
And -- Yeshua's First (most important) commandment
was Mt 22:37 -- which says (really) that we are to
love the "God within ourself" -- always.
Y'shua probably had quite good teaching there. Pity nobody in his posse could write anything down as events occurred, eh?
A couple of minutes ago -- you said:
"Well now also considering serving brethren && sisters, some are more like the supposed Son than others."
Tell me a bit more on that please.
I think there are significance to comparability && qualit8ive assessment when possible.
Ok.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
In my l8st Octology ckm8 screenshot I summoned 2 of GrandmasterGerryGentle one-focused but both seen in board-represent8ion at the bottom: https://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology/raw/master/gfx/sho/Octology-ckm8-shot_1918x1027-K7PM2New.png
Got it.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Your left piece there on P-square is blocking my PippiPawn from the slaying scythe of s8n back on z-square. Nice of you to land me cover while I give the other queen some business, hehe.  üòâ
You're welcome.
üòä
Do you happen to have any ideas about what kind of Chess or otherwise abilities your player should have, maybe stifling s8n somehow if you could be apprehensive about what he might unleash on the unsuspecting rank-and-file pieces that didn't know about meta-game yet?
...  thinking  ...
No -- I do not.    Sorry.
That's okay. Maybe try to think of something befitting a Grandmaster type. Jesus is w8ing in the wings to enter the fray whenever probably the Light side (at least) would call Him in.
ok
Well thank you for the gr8 long chat tonight. We'll see about much of it. I ‚ù§
you and hope you have a gr8 rest of your BirthDay.  üòä
I thank you too -- for the chat -- and the birthday greetings.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Shall we meet again in 6 days ?
Let's, please!
Ok.   Thank you.   Until Fri Aug 14 2020 then.
Have a grreat week My Lord.
üòä
You're welcome. You have a gr8 week ahead too Dad.
Thank you.
Good morning.
6'08-08-20 - 0842 Gtime / 0742 Ptime
You were in a call with Gerry
Aug 8, 7:45 AM
Shabbat Shalom Dad.
5'08-14-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Shabbat Shalom Philip.
How are you this fine Summer evening?
And how are you this evening ?
Whoops.
I'm pretty good, thanks.  üòä
You got your Q in first.
Me too.
I'm happy.
I'm healthy.
Good to hear.
I am terrific !!
Excellent!
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
Yep.
'Tis indeed.
I especially want to thank you for our last chat.
You're welcome. Specifically why, may I ask?
Yes, you may.
You are my teacher.
And -- last week was not an exception to the norm.
You are always my teacher.
But -- as I was reviewing our "marathon" chat --
from last weekend -- I became strongly aware --
of how much you bring to me.
Thank you so much.
üòä
Wow. That's gr8. You bring much to me too.  üòä
I ‚ù§
 you Philip.
That's good.
Thank you.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
Thank you Pip.
You're welcome.
I love it.
I haven't yet reviewed our marathon chat which extended on into your hopefully very Happy Birthday, so I trust you can please remind me of the context of anything we got into then which you have any reason to delve into further, but that might no longer remain fresh in my mind.
Everything can always be delved into further.
But I did not find any glaring topics which --
left anything of major substance dangling.
This was a bit unusual.
Frequently we get into things which then --
transition into another area.
Agreed.
Result being:
things left dangling.
But we done great last weekend.
All "books" seemed to have been appropriately closed.
üòä
Cool.
Yep.
Would you like to share the highpoints of this past week ?
Both the good ones --
and the not so.
Umm well one topic which was a very high-point was rumin8ing on Axiom #14 for much of yesterday.
Xcellent.
Any milk from it ?
Not so much your intention with it, but rather the inherent significance of attempting to evalU8 how "powerful" various pairs of words are, especially rel8ive to each other.
Go on please.
I thought of dozens of candid8 pairs which I would value as more powerful than just "Thank you." so my ideas may be somewhat contentious with your axiom's assertion, but I brought myself to uproarious laughter several times. It was remarkably enjoyable to think about and explore.
I'm leaning in.
Go on morely.
I guess the first examples to mention cheat a little bit by *not* being "in the English Language", but "Muchas gracias." and "Arigatoo gozaimasu." led to "Much thanks." or "Thanks much." which all seem to str8-forwardly be slightly more powerful than just "Thank you."
I also thought of "Fuck yourself." and "Eat shit." as both rather more powerful. We don't need to dwell on those.
Then I though of some others, like "nuclear deton8ion" and "World War".
I also thought of including various people's first and last names as being more powerful too, but that felt too much like cheating.
I thought of city names combined with sports teams, in a similar vein to mostly famous names.
Sorry.   Gmail just crashed.
I joked around with 2-word advertising slogans, which were hilarious to pretend to compare against "atom bomb", "concentr8ion camp", and the like regarding respective "power".  üòâ
Of your 5 paragraphs above --
I had seen the 1st one before the crash --
and was in the process of responding with:
              I think that is a good evalu8ion.
Thanks. Yeah, it actually turned into a rather fun and challenging game.
Go on.
This is interesting.
I eventually arrived at a pinnacle triangle of powerful pairs being: "Earth destroyed", "eternal life", and "eternal torture" as sharing the top most powerful spot together.
"Motherfucking niggers" is pretty high up there too.  üòâ
Hmm.
"Muppet Babies" and "Got milk?" were also memorable candid8s. Some of my ideas were very silly and comedic in timing. We might be able to develop this concept into a game which would probably be pretty simple and fun for others to enjoy as well.
And sell it to Milton-Bradley ?
Maybe, or just produce and sell it ourselves directly.
After the initial version all about pairs of words evalU8d along various dimensions like most powerful, paradoxical, sinister, inspiring, etc. we could work on releasing a massive new word triplets version which could be played alone, or combined with the earlier pairs version for a whole lot more to consider and estim8 for.
For me mostly alone for several hours yesterday, it was quite challenging and fun to think about.
Thinking is something that most people --
do not wish to spend much time doing.
I like the you are different.
Most of the people who made substantial --
contributions to our world --
were quite dedicated thinkers.
/the/  /that/
I do wish to spend much (if not most) of my time thinking, as well as desire to make substantial contributions to our world (and beyond).
I'm glad to usually be a dedic8d thinker.
You are.
And ...
you will.
Thank you for your encouragement. I appreC8 it gr8ly.
You are welcome.
Octology is only the beginning.
So that should cover the "Word Pairs" fun topic adequ8ly from my end. Have any of my ideas caused you to think of others that are serious or funny to toss into the mix?
Not yet.
But -- I am not done thinking about it either -- thank you.
Cool. Feel free to bring up any you think of. I imagine it would be even more fun to play together with others.
Thank you.
So then, is there anything on your PCA for tonight?
I (now) am --
"feeling free".
üòä
My PCA is blank.
What does yours look like ?
Well I have 4 more topics, any of which we could try to get into somewhat tonight, or l8r on as approprE8.
Go please.
Pick a topic.
Any topic.
Thy audience aw8s.
The first is basically an "assignment" for you to please 0. purchase a web-cam && 1. install CygWin on one of your computers. You can do these in any order, and take a few weeks (if needed), but I'd like you to please address both eventually and rather soon please?
Do those both sound to you like acceptable goals to get around to somewhat promptly ahead?
Which one would you like me to talk about first ?
Either is fine.
lol
Ok.
I'll do the first one you mentioned first.    (FIFO)
Web cameras cost money -- I believe.
Do I wish to spend some on a web camera ?
Up until now -- I have not seen a great --
They do. LogiTech makes some that I've had good experiences with and don't seem to be too overpriced.
deal of good reasons to do so.
I know that Pip has requesting it --
for quite some time now.
But -- I have yet to see any great advantage to it.
Yes. I'd very much like to see you during our chats too, even if you can't speak audibly along with the view.
I think it would make our mutual experience significantly better.
As I try to imagine what it would give you --
I can't quite "get it".   I am very still --
and awfully boring -- to watch --
as I type.
Maybe so, but just seeing your face and expressions and posture etc. would probably be quite worthwhile to me especially, but also a benefit to others you might communic8 with online.
You are my sole online communicant.
Don't you get a lot of extra valuable communic8ive impressions from usually seeing me during our chats?
A few -- yes.
A lot -- no.
The one thing I do like about --
the video thing is --
Ah. Okay. Well maybe I could enjoy seeing you more than you do me, but it's fine if you decide not to acquire a web-cam right away. Eventually, hopefully.
hearing you talk outloud to yourself.
But -- you don't do that a lot --
and your music frequently --
makes it unhearable.
Yet -- the stuff that you type --
is valuable beyond measure.
Yes. Sorry to drown out my voice much of the time, but I do often think better with EDM playing loudly.
Thank you so much.
That's ok.
You're welcome. I appreC8 what you type too.
As I said --
what you type --
are the pearls that I so love.
Is your camera zoomable ?
Maybe only via certain software. The hardware doesn't seem easily adjustable. I'm not sure yet.
I ask because -- last week you were showing me --
multiple screens.
Tonight -- just a much smaller bit.
Yeah, there's a few places and orient8ions I have for my camera.
I see.
Last week -- you were tight in on the bottom 2 -- I think.
I could clearly see both your running-dater --
and also your Gmail app.
That was nice.
Glad you liked. I am usually fine with showing anything I have up on my displays.
Maybe one of your contacts has an older web-cam that they don't use anymore, which they could gift to you or sell you very cheaply. I'd like it if you could please try to get a working one sometime soon.
Noted.
Thank you.
Please feel free to move on to whatever you have to say about CygWin whenever you're ready.
Ok.
I shall.
Now.
You would like me to get CygWin because ?
CygWin is probably the best way to get much of Octology to run on MicroSoft Windows machines. It's probably a prerequisite there. I'd really like you to eventually become capable of running Octology directly yourself.
And -- I am w8ing because ?
I'll be right back. Going to feed Darjeeling some dinner.
Give her a kiss for me please.
‚ù§
Will do. Thanks.  ‚ù§
What was for "dinner" ?
Her fave ?
Dry Purina cat-food. She prefers wet food from cans, so I give her some of that every couple weeks or so.
Nice.
Thank you.
What varieties does the "wet" come in ?
Many different varieties of various different meat combin8ions.
I get her an assortment.
Can you determine which one(s) she likes best ?
Not yet.
Maybe she slightly prefers fish and poultry to beef. Not quite sure yet.
Me too.
And I prefer the wet over the dry too.
üòä
I tend to like fish and beef equally myself, and poultry somewhat less so, then pork last.
I'm making a note of that.
Thank you.;
You're welcome.
Is "ham" pork ?
Yes.
Why is pork white and ham red ?
I avoid pork as much as it's easy and affordable to do so. It's pretty prevalent all around Wisconsin though.
Both are red probably, but I think a pork-industry ad campaign attempted to re-define itself as "white" meat, even though it probably doesn't deserve to be called that.
Hmm.
Thank you.
Are we ready to return to the Cygwin topic ?
Yep.
        You said:
CygWin is probably the best way to get much of Octology to run on MicroSoft Windows machines. It's probably a prerequisite there. I'd really like you to eventually become capable of running Octology directly yourself.
        I replied:
And -- I am w8ing because ?
Umm because you imagine CygWin to be hard or otherwise burdensome to install and learn how to use on top of your Windows experience?
That may be part of it.
But there is a bigger.
What might that be ?
I don't know. You're afraid of it for some reason?
Sales.
What about sales?
CygWin is free.
You have zero users of Octology worldwide.
Oh. Yeah, so?
I want to talk to a couple of satisfied customers.
For what purpose?
There are quite a few ways that a product --
can be promoted to the public.
One of the strongest is called:
"word of mouth".
Your satisfied customers "sell" --
your wonderful doodad to prospects.
I want those satisfied customers to --
convince me that I will love Octology.
Octology (like CygWin) is free to download, use, and customize. Once I have a user-base, I will try to solicit don8ions and p8rons from among them, but the project is unlikely to be sold as any traditional commercial software has been.
It would help me immeasurably if you could become my first user.
That's fine.
Probably I can give you my own "word-of-mouth" to convince you that most of it will be worthwhile to learn and use, even if you only love few parts of it.
When you can sell me -- you will be able to (also) sell others.
When you can sell me -- you will be able to (also) sell others.
 
         Or ...
 
When you have been able to sell others -- you will (also) sell me.
So your being "sold" on Octology is more contingent on me being able to sell it to others first? Why must this be the case?
No.
The "or" -- fully allows for it to happen in either direction.
Why do others matter either way?
A number of weeks ago --
we began talking about how you were --
going to promote (sell) it.
How are you coming along on that ?
Poorly. I have no real sales or marketing or branding or promotion experience. I still don't have any clear picture of who my core target audience for it ought to be.
Ok.
And -- what do you plan to do -- to move that forward ?
Keep thinking about it and maybe watching a few videos about marketing here and there, to hopefully inform me how I might go about it better.
Good.
What else ?
Other than those, I'll probably mainly just try to keep developing more and better fE8ures so that it's eventually far more valuable than it already has become to me alone, so far.
How is it possible that this system is so --
valuable to one person -- but no one
else can see it ?
It's probably possible and the case because I am so unique, as both sole developer, and only person who can find it to be of significant value. How it's possible for no one else to see the value in it yet, I'm really not sure about that part. It must be incomprehensible broadly, or bewildering, intimid8ing, threatening, etc. in ways I don't yet know how to resolve.
Good.
And in that statement lie the keys to the answers --
which you seek.
How?
If I knew -- I would think that I would tell you.
You might remember our recent chat about --
questions and answers.
As you find your way to --
asking the right questions --
the answers you've been wanting --
will pop right up.
So why won't you please become my first Octology user then?
I've readd a number of books on sales --
since I've started breathing in this skinsuit.
I've also had a number of sales jobs --
during that same time.   I believe --
about a month ago -- I listed that --
4 major ones for you.   And --
at each of those jobs -- I had --
people who further educated me --
on the art of selling.
I am going to share one of the --
things that I learned here.
There are 3 step is every sale.
   (1)   Get attention.
   (2)   Share benefits
   (3)   Close
That last one means:
   close the sale
   get the money
   deliver the product
The "sticking point" in your desire to --
sell Octology -- is -- in the --
sharing of the benefits.
You have not come up with --
how to share the benefits --
with your prospect(s).
Possibly that it because you have --
not determined (exactly) what the --
benefits of Octology really are.
               Maybe.
/step/  /steps/
If you could try learning and using it, this would really help me discover what benefits it might provide to others. Being the sole author and user for so many years, I lack almost all external perspective.
Well Pip --
You could also gr8ly help me get most of it to run smoothly within CygWin on MS Windows machines, which I don't have and can't develop for on my own yet.
I believe that (possibly) you'll have to do --
one of two things. 
Either -- find a way to develop that "external perspective".
Or -- find a person who will sell the product for you.
I think it needs a growing user-base before it makes any sense to worry about selling support, training, fixes, fE8ures, etc..
Ok.
Good.
Or you just mean "sell" figur8ively for usage as well?
Yes "getting users" is "sales".
It confuses me to use "sales" so generally, for Free Software like Octology, but I'll try to remember you mean both by it.
I'm sorry.
You probably have not seen how universal "sales" is.
Maybe just persuading people on the benefits of becoming users, and then eventually trying to actually "sell" some top users on why they should don8 or p8ronize the project, when they can afford to, would make most sense to me.
In its most fundamental form --
it has nothing whatsoever to do with money.
When a man asks a girl to go --
with him to a movie -- this is a sale.
If she says "yes" -- he sold it.
If she says "no" -- he didn't sell it.
What is the "it" here ?
The "it" is the idea.
The idea of spending some time together -- and -- in this case -- at a movie theater.
This is sales.
I'm inclined to protest that "sales" in most fundamental form is overwhelmingly to do with money, but I understand why you think of it far more broadly than all the ways I've encountered it.
Think back Philip.
Before coinage.
Before printing paper.
Did people "sell" things ?
Of course.
And -- from Day-One --
It was always:
I lack experience with pre-money eras of bartering or whatever, but during my lifetime "sales" has been monetary around me.
   (1)   Get attention
   (2)   Share benefits
   (3)   Close
Well why can't I do those 3 things for you?
I'll shovel the snow from you front walk --
in exchange for lunch.
Sales.
Yeah. Okay.
For a ride downtown --
I'll treat you to an ice cream sundae.
Sales.
You want to learn to play the guitar ?
I will teach you.
What will you give me in return for that ?
Sales.
Okay.
        Here's a different one:
A student raises his hand in a classroom.
The teacher says:  "Yes ?"
The student asks a question about how to do something.
The teacher gives the student an answer.
Does that student use what the teacher suggested ?
If yes -- the teacher made a sale.
If no -- the teacher did not make a sale.
What was being "sold" ?
The idea -- of how -- to do something.
Sales.
Now.
You asked a question.
     "Well why can't I do those 3 things for you ?"
Good question.
And I had answered it previous in this discussion.
It's about the benefits.
You have not shared with me --
a feature of Octology --
which I have (mentally) "bought" accepted --
to be a benefit to/for me.
Okay. Thanks for reiter8ing that. I will keep thinking about what benefits Octology would (and can eventually) benefit you.
Good.
s/benefits/characteristics of/;
And don't try to come up with benefit-ssss.
Just find one.
One benefit.
That sounds prohibitively difficult. It does way too many different things, at differing levels of detail, in varying standard and non-standard ways, probably particularly for differing groups of prospective users. Distilling down to a single general benefit might never be all that feasible (unless I were to simplify, streamline, and remove much of what I've already included).
No Pip.
Don't touch the software.
Don't change one single thing about it.
Just -- tell me one thing it can do for me.
Just one.
Familiarity with Octology will improve your ability to solve problems with software.
s/(improve)/drastically $1/;
Not specific enough.
Octology will enable you to write your own software to solve almost any problem.
I already know a number of programming languages.
Why do I need another ?
Because the programming languages used in Octology have strengths that other languages lack. Octology languages will teach you how to program in other languages even better than you had before.
Still way too broad.
Because Perl is the best programming language.
Please tell me one tiny little thing that Octology will do for me.
Octology will benefit you by describing any calendar date as just 3 characters (as many as the Month alone, or DayOfWeek, is usually abbreV8d to be).
Good.
Now.
A question for you.
How many people do you know that want to be able to do that ?
Nobody wants to do that yet, because they can't imagine it could ever make enough sense to work sufficiently well for them. All people should want it, even though none do yet. Hopefully eventually, everyone will adopt and prefer it.
Good answer.
You had 2 other items on your PCA.
Did you want to get into the next one ?
Sure. Can you please fill me in on Axioms #2 through #5? I know you said they'd be provided as needed, but I'm missing more than half of them and would like to progressively fill in the remainder to become able to assess them all together.
I could -- but The Axioms are not like The Pieces of Light.
You get all 29 of The Pieces of Light at one time --
so you can decide if (and when) to use each one.
The Axioms are different.
Well the 27 are PoL #6 so why not give them all?
You receive them -- only when you need them.
I just looked at the 4 which you said you are "missing".
And -- you don't need any of them at the moment.
I want (and maybe need) to collect and consider them all cohesively.
Okay, then how about #7, 9 through 13, 20, 21, 24, or 25 please?
PoL #6 is simply to make our stus aware that --
besides the 29 Pieces -- there are also 27 Axioms --
which may become needed at some future time.
This is not about having "a full collection".
Many of the Axioms you do not need --
because you already live by them.
I do want a full collection because they pertain to your values and advice and guidance to me and others throughout most of your life though. I have 13 out of 27 so far. 1 more would push my collection past the half-way point. Can you please provide whatever ones I already live by or that I may need most next, even if I don't quite need them yet?
Actually that is not true of the Axioms.
It is true of the Pieces --
but not of the Axioms.
You will notice in Piece of Light #6 --
that it says:  Farfar's Axioms.
Now -- besides your comments --
you also asked a question.
More than just potentially valuable principles to live by, I want them all to hopefully come to understand *you* better.
I'm looking over the Axioms now --
and shall see if you might "need" any for --
this upcoming week.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
But first --
You added a comment.
And -- to that -- I shall say --
getting to know other people --
has some value to it --
in most cases.    However --
Socrates did not say:
     " Get to know people around you. "
He said:
     " Know thyself. "
Ok.
I've looked over the 27 Axioms.
I believe the one that will best serve you --
in the coming 7 days -- is --
#19.
Do you have that one ?
I do. Thank you.  üòâ
Well.   Eat it more fully this week please.
Rather rel8d to 14, which we already got into earlier.
You're welcome.
Rel8ed -- absolutely.
But a very different point to make.
And --
life-changing --
when you fully eat it.
Alright. Well I think that may be enough chatting for me for tonight, unless you have anything else for us?
Your other PCA item.
You wish to w8 on that one ?
Yeah. It can w8. I made a note of it.
Ok then.
Thank you for this chat.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're welcome. Thank you too. I ‚ù§

Thank you for that.

`inline cod block ?`
Yes, sort of. In typical Unix shells (from command-line or within shell-scripts and maybe a few other more minor areas) as well as Perl, backticks typically enclose running a command with parameters (or sequence of such) within a sub-process and usually default shell but with environment variables usually inherited from the parent process. It can be understood pretty well as an `echo "backticks can be like an inline-code-block"`.
What specifically prompted you to ask?
Shabbat Shalom Dad.

The universe is in perfect order.
    Neither of us were available to chat last night!
How is Tera for you?
    Interesting.
Tera is now better.
Spent some time last night -- doin' some fixin'.
Thank you for asking.
What required fixing?
Various stuff just goes "haywire" from time to time.
Usually a reboot fixes most of it --
temporarily.   But in time -- it all happens again.
I do not like to reboot.
I lose all my open windows.
The only program that is retainable --
through the reboot is my XPMode.
It has an internal "hibernate" feature.
Nice.
I prefer rarely requiring reboot also, but scripting most windows restored afterwards is decent for me.
"scripting most windows restored"   ?
Oh, yeah. Hibern8ion can be pretty good too. Yeah, that *is* nice. Glad you have it.  üòä
Me too.
Wish it could auto-apply to every program.
I have a cascade of aliases and shell commands called `ti` (if such back-ticks could indic8 my Zsh shell to interpret my Terminal-Initializ8ion (opening 88 terminals minus the first, I think... like 4 score && 7 Gnome-terms). It's kinda scripting which can popul8 my 8 workspaces, restoring most windows for me.
Nice.
Glad you have that.
Oops. I nested regular parenthesis but failed to close the outer one... so s/(\))/$1$1/; should fix that.
Haha. Also s/(parenthes)is/$1es/; to pluralize that with hopefully proper spelling.
Not sure I understand any of that --
which you just typed.
In rather standard Perl Regular-Expression syntax, regular parentheses blocks (not in a square-bracket character-class or just un-escaped, i.e., without a preceding backslash) get counted from left-paren openings on default $1 up to $9 before you have to do naming or altern8 indexing to get others.
So $1 is referring to the paren-blocks in the first portion of each reg-ex.
The first regex replaced the first close-paren you find with 2 of itself. The second took just 'parenthes' and changed the following vowel used before the common final letter 's' was supplied again.
Thank you -- but it's all "Perl-Greek" to me.
üòä
Okay.
lol
Good.
I have learned a number of programming --
languages over the years --
and I do very well with them.
But -- I have also attempted to --
learn a couple of others --
but their syntax (et cetera) --
is just beyond my ability to --
Gerry missed a call from you
Aug 22, 7:29 PM
comprehend them.
Your video just came up --
but there is no Pip in it.
Sorry. Yeah, becoming capable of comprehending unfamiliar languages (programming or spoken) can be pretty challenging. I tried popping the video window open but then gave up after a few attempts were made.
The video window says that I am the only one here.
Maybe we can try video again l8r.
If you wish.
--------------------------------------------
 
By the way -- that line that I had typed
at 1940 G / 1840 P -- this evening -- was
not me attempting to communicate with you.
 
I was just experimenting.  I had gone online
to see if hangouts had any way of adjusting
the color of text -- and (apparently) that
answer is "no".
 
But while in that searchery -- I found some
shortcuts for ‚Ä¢ bolding, and ‚Ä¢ italicizing
-- and then something about creating a
"code block" -- by encasing text in "backticks"
-- which shares the tilde key.
 
So.  I was trying it out.
But -- I didn't see that it did anything.
Do you understand that thing ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You mean "thing" as how to change Hangouts appearance? I think your descriptions make sense, but can't recall having them on-hand myself yet.
I meant -- what is a "code block" in Google (Gchat) Hangouts ?
` code block `
I don't know yet.
Ok.
*bold*
_italicize_
They don't work either.
I know what Perl and GNU/Linux shell scripts primarily use back-ticks for, which might be somewhat similar to GChat or whatever.
It's not important.
I know the other way to bold and italicize --
so I'm ok with those.
I think I have to Ctrl-B to toggle Bold in Hangouts on my end, and Ctrl-I for Italics.
underline works too.
Yeah.
For me too.
Yep.   And Ctrl-u for underline.
You had said that your week went "good".
Would you like to share more on that ?
Umm, I'm not sure what more to share about my week yet.
Ok.
Just thought I'd ask.
I tried thinking of PCA material too, but didn't come up with anything right now, other than maybe Weather Report when desired.
Ok Charlie.
Anything on your agenda?
Thy wish is my command.
Weather Report follows.
------------------------------------------------------------
 
Thursday (08-20-2020) was a "Very Un-August Day".
  
Quite "mid-September-ish".  Mid-70s.  Low humidity.
And a nice breeze too.  When I went for my walk
-- I really didn't want to come back home.
 
Yep.  I ‚ù§
d it !!
üòä
Gr8!  üòä
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.
It made me thing of you.
You're welcome. Thank you.
You're welcome.
whoops
/thing/  /think/
s/(thin)g/$1k/;
That's Perl -- right ?
Yeah.
It says:  "change the spelling of "thing" to "think" -- does it ?
Yep.
Wooh !!
I'm A Perl Programmer !!
üòä
üòä
lol
I think I recognize the ";" character.
JavaScript uses that ";" to end a line of code.
Many languages with C-style syntax do.
But -- I must admit -- although I have written some --
JavaScript -- I am neither good at it --
nor comfortable with it.
Yes -- and I took one look at "C" --
and said "No thank you.  I think I'll pass on --
trying to learn that one.
"
Perl is a C-style language -- yes ?
Yep.
I learned FORTRAN in 1970 -- and it served me well.
And when I learned BASIC in 1981 --
I found it very similar to FORTRAN --
and quite easy to learn.
Cool.
And then Microsoft took BASIC --
sometime (I think) around the late 80s --
and enhanced it greatly -- and the result
was that it (since then) can do anything
I ever want a program to do for me.
Which is why it has become the program
which I use to write nearly anything
that I wish.
Sorry.    /program/  /language/
Right on.
Of course -- I have also written thousands --
of "DOS" batch-files over the years too.
But Perl can write video games too -- yes ?
Somewhat. It's generally too slow to write particularly responsive games with, but can be useful for some things beyond prototyping.
Ah so.
But you worked as a video-game programmer -- yes ?
What language did you use there ?
Primarily Perl and C/C++. My Perl code usually was for utilities and experimental interfaces mainly using Tk (libraries ported from the Tcl/Tk language).
Oh.   Ok.   Thank you.
So  C  and C++  are the video-game languages ?
Mostly, yeah they were when I was in the industry (and probably still predomin8 there).
Tak.
That means "thank you" in Danish.
You have any PCA for this evening ?
None from me for this evening. How about you?
We've covered all but one.
How do you feel ?
Awake ?
Yes. At least somewhat.
lol
Somewhat ?
Explain please.
I feel at least somewhat awake and aware right now.
Ok.
Thank you.
Some things which I (personally) find interesting --
could fail to strike others as the same.
I wrote you a (slightly long) essay.
Do you want it tonight --
or some other time ?
Tonight could be fine to give it, and depending on content I may try to finish it another time.
lol.
I'm thinking  ...
2148 G / 2048 P
Ok.
I guess I'll ship it.
Ready ?
I think so.
lol
Ok.
Here it comes.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
             MY LATE BIRTHDAY CARD
 
I receive about 10 to 12 birthday cards each
year -- from close friends.
 
This year -- one was missing.  I was not overly
concerned about it -- but -- I did wonder a bit.
 
And then -- on Thursday (08-20-2020) it arrived
-- and I noticed that it was mailed on Wednesday,
August 5th.  That's 15 days!! to deliver it from
its sender -- just 8.76 miles south of me.
 
Surprising ?  Yes.  And no.  I have noticed
a number of things about the postal service
over the years -- which is quite far less
than I believe we should be expecting from
our tax dollars.
 
And -- although I have learned to live with
most of them (regarding these deficiencies
as merely "a nuisance") -- this one is
borderline "alarming".
 
Lately we have heard that a number of things
are happening -- in an attempt to reduce the
fact that the Postal Service is continually
losing money.
 
               But -- this is not news.
 
As of the end of 2019 -- our U.S. Postal
Service was 160,900,000,000 dollars in debt.
 
Yes.  It's true that part of
the Post Office's problems
are due to the coming of:
 
     ‚Ä¢   UPS     1907
     ‚Ä¢   Fedex  1971
     ‚Ä¢   Email   1995
 
But I don't see that as sufficient reason
to pardon our elected officials from doing
what they they were sent to Washington to do.
 
    Which is:  serve their constituency.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                      A little history first.
 
Our country (the USA) has had a postal system
since even before it officially became a nation.
I'm pretty sure the U.S. Postal Service hasn't been funded by tax dollars or governed by elected officials in Washington D.C. for a long time either. Changed to be priv8 at some point, but kept the name and legacy, or something like that.
 
Yep.   Privatized in 1971.
 
Our first Postmaster General, Benjamin Franklin,
was appointed on July 26th 1775 -- 11¬º months
before July 4th 1776.
 
But it would be another 88 years before home
(and business place) delivery would begin.   
 
Yes.  Prior to 1863 -- everyone had to go
physically (personally) to the local post
office -- to pick up their mail.
 
By the following year (1864) -- free city
delivery had been established in 65 cities
nationwide -- which (of course) included 
Reading -- as it was then the 37th largest
city in America.   
 
         Reading dropped out of the Top 100 in 1960
         -- and today, doesn‚Äôt even make the Top 300.
 
In the next 36 years (by 1900) the national
city-count was up to 796 -- but Birdsboro,
and Fleetwood, and the other tiny towns in Berks
County (and the nation) were yet to be added.
 
By the 1930‚Äôs, the delivery system included
just about everywhere and everyone -- even
unto the most remote rural areas.
 
And -- I must add -- for about the first 175
years of our United States Postal Service --
the watchword was absolutely about Service.
 
                 From 1775 to about 1950.
 
In fact -- for the first 7 years of my
breathing days -- our house got 2 (count'em)
2 mail deliveries per day.  Two !!
 
       But that stopped in 1950 -- Monday,
              April 17th -- in most cities.
 
And over the next 10 (or so) years
-- the old watchword changed -- from
"Service" to:  " How can we cut costs ?"
 
Of course -- they increased prices too.
And I'm not about to complain about that.
 
That's both "to be expected" and reasonable.
 
When I was a kid the stamp was    3-cents.
                                   Now -- it's   55-cents.
 
             And a number of the other
                  changes were ok too.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
But then -- in 2015 -- they did something
that I IB2 did not see as Ok.   And ...
             whoops
 
But then -- in 2015 -- they did something
that I did not not see as Ok.   And ...
 
I'm not sure just how they kept it so quiet.
 
But it was something of which very few people
were actually aware -- as there was (curiously)
little fanfare or heralding of it -- even in
newspapers / radio / TV / or magazines.
 
          Even on the internet -- nothing !!
 
From the 1930‚Äôs -- and up until the end of
2014 -- all local delivery times were 1 day.
 
And this ‚Äúlocal‚Äù often included even
some areas stretching into quite a bit
beyond 20 or 30 miles.
 
             And then it happened.
 
For the first time in 80 years --
there is now  :::  no 1 day delivery
-- to anywhere -- from anywhere -- EVER !!
 
So.  If you mail a letter in Oshkosh -- to someone
at 811 Mallard Avenue (yes, just across the street)
-- on a Monday -- they won‚Äôt receive it until Wednesday !!
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Here is the old (2014) map -- for me (eastern PA).
 
  
You‚Äôll notice (above) that the blue (1 day) area for
things mailed from Reading (and environs) extended to
the SW, 130 miles, to the Maryland border -- and
to the NW, 170 miles, to the New York State border.
 
This is (was) nearly one-half of the state of
Pennsylvania ‚Äî  getting 1 day service from Reading.
 
The blue area was 1-day delivery from Reading
 
The red area was 2 day delivery from Reading.
 
The green area was 3 day delivery -- including
nearly all of the rest of the country -- 48
states entirely, and portions of the other two.
 
Here is the new (2015) map -- for me (eastern PA).
 
 
As of Thursday, January 1st 2015 -- the United
States Postal Service abolished, revoked, and
expunged: ALL ONE DAY FIRST-CLASS DELIVERIES
FOREVER -- as you can see on the new (2015)
map (above).
 
There is no more blue area.  Nor is there expected
to be, ever again.  So.  If you want to get anything
to your "across-the-street" neighbor by tomorrow --
I suggest you just walk it on over there, and lay it
in her hand.
 
                      Anyway -- the bottom-line is:
 
For the first time in 80 years --
there is now  :::  no 1 day delivery
-- to anywhere -- from anywhere -- EVER !!
 
   And thus ends my rant on the USPS for today.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Wow! Thank you so much for that (slightly long) essay. Inform8ive.
             But here's a little more 
          history I found interesting.
        Have a Dew and a blue cigar Pip.
                 We're not done yet.
 
             Here's a little more
        history I found interesting.
 
Originally, letter carriers worked 52 weeks
a year -- typically 9 to 11 hours per day --
Monday through Saturday -- and if necessary
-- part of Sunday.
 
An Act of June 27, 1884, granted them 15 days
of leave per year.  In 1888, Congress declared
that 8 hours was a full day‚Äôs work and that
carriers would be paid for additional hours
worked per day.
 
     The 40-hour work week began in 1935.
 
Carriers walked as many as 22 miles a day,
carrying up to 50 pounds of mail at a time. 
They were instructed to deliver letters
frequently and promptly ‚Äî- generally twice
a day to homes and up to four times a day
to businesses.
 
But (as I said above) the second residential
delivery was discontinued on Monday, April 17,
1950, in most cities.
 
Multiple deliveries to businesses were phased
out over the next few decades as changing
transportation patterns made most mail available
for first-trip delivery.
 
The weight limit of a carrier‚Äôs load
was reduced to 35 pounds by the mid-1950s
and remains the same today.
 
In 2006 -- the number of letter
carriers delivering mail in our
nation‚Äôs cities was: 224,400.

And here's a "nutshell" chart that I
compiled several years ago (March 2015).

 Oh.  Just one other thing.
 
What did Wisconsin mail carriers
look like 112 years ago ?

             MY LATE BIRTHDAY CARD
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
2228 G / 2128 P
Thank you. Sorry I just sent you an e-mail and didn't get around to a card in the regular mail for you this year.
Don't be sorry.
The email counts.
It's not about the type of conduit.
       Just being remembered is fully one-dur-full !!
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
Now.   About my 40-minute essay --
with 6 photos and/or charts --
I'd like a short applause -- and --
(at least) one comment.
Thank you.
[Applause] ...
lol
Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you very much.
Seems FedEx shouldn't have had to try to take over the U.S.P.S. in order to provide 1-day local deliveries if that's what they had in mind to do.
Hmm.
Of course -- I wrote this in 2015.
I was just playing with ideas.
Right on.
Ok.
Now my PCA is exhausted.
Thank you for staying awake.
You're welcome.
Did you have a blue cigar ?
I had one that looked a bit bluish for a moment but was a light green one since I don't have any blue packs open right at the moment.
Hey.   Green is pretty too.
I agree. Hangouts would be cooler with colors probably too.
Me thinks yes.
But I can live with black.
Is this "chat" software written in C++ ?
I toggle Hangouts pop-out windows most of the time to white text.
Probably primarily JavaScript.
Ah yes.
JavaScript -- really ??
That would be my first guess.
Ok.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Well -- My Lord -- what's next ?
I'm not sure.
Did you have challah yester ?
Not this week. Just some grape juice.
Ah so.
Am I remembering correctly that "Dew"
is one of your fave beverages ?
I used to like Mountain Dew more than I do now. It's still usually good once-in-a-while for me, but I tend to buy and consume a similar generic Big-K soda flavor called "Citrus Drop" recently.
Ah yes.
I wrote an essay on "The Dew"
about 10¬º years ago.
Shall I share it with you ?
It's shorter than the USPS one.
Maybe another time would be better, thanks.
Oh, okay. If you want to.
lol
You're funny Pip.
W8.
I want to check out the E.R.T.
(estimated reading time)
-- before you commit to this.
BRB
I get about 47 seconds.
Shall we do 'er ?
Okay.
There she is.
Heh. Thank you.  üòä
You're welcome.
You like citrus huh ?
Sometimes.
That's lemon-ish -- right ?
Maybe.
Could be primarily from other similar citrusy fruits.
Well -- I also did a 55-minute essay --
on the Queen of the citrus fizzy beverages too.
Also from late Spring of 2010.
If you can guess what it is --
I'll ship it to you.
Cactus Cooler? Yum!  üòâ
Squirt too.
Those are more of ones I like better than Dew.
Sorry -- no essays on either of those.
Do you know the Queen ?
Maybe not.
The best selling citrus ever ?
There's a number in its name.
7-Up.
Bingo !!
Give that man a kewpie doll.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
As you may have noticed in this --
one -- I created these essays for --
I tend to think of Lemon-Lime sodas as mostly clear and Citrus ones as more cloudy white-ish.
Rosa's website.
Where I took you for white pizza --
in March of 2007.
I did a mini-essay on every beverage --
that they offered -- and (actually) --
on every single item on their menu.
Yes -- I think you are right about that --
the citrus are more cloudy.
I've always loved root beer.
But it wasn't until this project for
Rosa's -- that I learned what is in it.
The 2 major flavors in root beer are --
wintergreen & vanilla.
Interesting.
Yes.
I was surprised to learn that --
but as soon as I thought about --
it for a moment -- It deffy makes sense.
This evening is a somewhat notable event for my d8 system (which occurs just 6 times each year for me). The d8 now is: "K8MMMMMM" which expands from `d8 K8MMMMMM` to: "Sat Aug 22 22:22:22:22 -0500 2020"
6 times ?
6-M's in the 22nd day of the Month, my time zone (M = -0500 from UTC), the hour of day (22 being 10PM), the 22nd minute, second, and phass. 6 total. The other half of the Years, my zone is L for -0600.
So those 6 of sameness happen after 9PM on the 21st Day of those Months instead.
Yes.   I see.   Daylight Saving.
Yep.
Thank you.
Thou art my rabbi.
You're welcome. Thank you for being my teacher on some things too.
You're welcome.
Just make a note on that  :::
I can knit --
but I can not Perl.
üòä
Maybe someday you'll pick up some useful Perl too.  üòä
It is in my 500-year goals list.
Far-out!  üòâ
lol
rotflol
Good one Pip !!
Thanks.
Yer wLcome.
I enjoy you.
Yes -- you learned that the 3rd best-selling --
soft drink in the world is 7-up.
Can you name #2 ?
Pepsi?
Ah yes.
This man is going to go home --
with oodles of kewpies I suspect.
Thank you. That's cool.
You're welcome.
And now for your "triplet of kewpies" question  :::
What Italian Hoagie is Philadelphia famous for ?
Cheese-Steak.
Ah yes.   Another winner ladies & gentleman !!
Thank you.
Randy was eating this cheese steak --
in celebration of Angie's 32nd birthday.
You're welcome.
Now -- this one might be a little difakult.
But -- if you don't get it "right-off" --
I'll give you a hint.
What is the first name of Rosa's husband ?
Randall?
No.
But here's your hint.
The same first name --
as your only uncle on your Dad's side of the family.
Michael?
Ah yes.
He has done it again !!
But --
I'm all out of kewpie dolls.
What would you like as your prize instead ?
      I have a blue Challenger with white racing stripes.
Would you like that one ?
Ooh. Probably.
Ok.
        It's yours.
Thanks!
Thank you. It's nice to see so much about Rosa's. What a gr8 local restaurant you've got there.  üòä
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Now.  You noticed in the caption under the --
photo of Mike -- we mentioned that one --
of the pages of our website is about --
"pizza lore".   And now here is --
your first question in that category  :::
There are 3 ingredients required of the basic pizza.
Can you name all 3 of them -- and --
for bonus points -- which of the 3 --
was not added until 1889 ?
Dough, tomato-sauce, and Mozzarella cheese... and tomato-sauce is my guess for the bonus question.
Well -- on the prime question --
you are (again) a winner.
But I'm all out of dolls and cars.
I have a home in The Hamptons.
Will you accept that as your prize ?
I think so. Where is The Hamptons though?
I think it's in up-state New York.
I'll have to look into that.
Okay.
Good.
Now.
About the bonus question.
I will send you an article.
If you can get the right answer on --
the bonus question -- from that --
we shall wall-to-wall carpet your --
home in the Hamptons -- as --
currently it only has hard-wood flooring.
Deal ?
Yes.
Good.
Here is the article.
Ah. The cheese came after the sauce.
The carpet crew is on their way.
They will be at your Mallard --
homestead before midnight.
Will you be home ?
I expect so.
Good.
 
And here is an interesting thing about your answer.
 
You said:
 
Dough, tomato-sauce, and Mozzarella cheese... and
tomato-sauce is my guess for the bonus question.
I guessed the essential ingredients from typical bottom-to-top, but then supposed that cheese had been added earlier than sauce, when the 3 had already also been basically chronological.
 
And here is an interesting thing about your answer.
 
You said:
 
Dough, tomato-sauce, and Mozzarella cheese... and
tomato-sauce is my guess for the bonus question.
 
You actually named the 3 ingredients in the very
order that they came to create the pizza.
 
But then -- you selected #2 as your guess for the last.
 
But that's alright.  You still got the carpet anyway.
What color(s) would you like for which rooms ? 
Hmm.
I just said what you had --
already said before.
I should listen before I speak.
Sorry.
üòû
Dark brown carpet could work well for me, maybe.
Okeedoke.
It's your crib.
You get your color.
Thanks.
You're welcome My Lord.
As you may have noticed --
as the prize get bigger --
the questions also get tuffer.
Are you ready for the next one ?
Yes.
Good.
In the U.S. -- the largest sub-divisions are called states.
In France -- the largest sub-divisions are called provinces.
What are the largest sub-divisions in Italy called ?
I don't know.
Starts with an "R" -- and the un-plural of the word has 6 letters in it.
Regions?
Please check the essay -- to see if you got it correct.
                          Did you ?
Yep, after the hint.
Yes -- you did.
And -- are you ready for your prize ?
Yes.
Good.    Here it is.
Would you like it delivered to Wittman Field ?
Thank you. I'm not sure where it might be best to have it delivered yet.
Well -- I was only suggesting Wittman --
because it is only 3¬Ω miles SSW of 812 Mallard.
But -- if you would prefer we deliver --
elsewhere -- that can certainly be done.
Thanks. Maybe my Dad in Reading, Pennsylvania could use that more immeD8ly than I could.
Well maybe.
But he is not certified to oper8 that type of aircraft yet.
However -- it is on his 50-year goal list.
The Reading Airport is Spaatz Field.
Pronounced  "spots".
"ah"
Well -- just let us know.
And -- save your pennies.
The per-hour cost of that Cessna Citation --
is about 4 to 5000 dollars --
much of which is for fuel.
Whoa!
RDG (Spaatz Field) to LAX (and back) --
will run about 50 to 60,000 dollars per trip.
OSH (Wittman Field) to LAX -- around 40,000.
It's not too terrible -- if you take a few
Remarkably costly.
passengers with you -- and
split the cost.
That one has 7 available seats.
Yes -- slightly salty -- but you must --
start becoming accustomed to traveling --
in the style to which you deserve.
 
And -- I should correct one thing
that I said earlier.
Thank you.
 
The Hamptons are on the east end of
Long Island -- not in upstate New York.
 
Sorry.
You're welcome.
Average cost of a home in The Hamptons is --
No problem. I've heard of the Hamptons but haven't been quite aware of where they were.
80 to 100,000,000.
Neither was I.
But now I know.
Thank you.
What a well-funded game-show you must be running there to award such prizes after kewpies have run out!  üòâ
Yes -- I agree.
Although I (personally) am not rich --
my Father is.
You may thank Him for the goodies.
As do I.
Dew eye ??
Maybe you could please thank Him for me? I don't seem to have any understood direct rel8ionship to Him yet.
No one does.
We all start out without it.
A (known) "relationship" -- that is.
If your Father is so rich, why hasn't he gifted such awards to you yet?
And -- we all feel that same way too.
Expecting that we need "another" to --
approach Him on our behalf.
But that is one of the gigantic --
differences between the Old "Testament" (agreement) --
and the New.   One of Yeshua's primary --
teachings was that -- we (none of us) --
need a "Moses" or an "Aaron".
We each are His (The Father's) Son
-- and none (not one) needs an intermediary.
I see a question.
A good question too !!
If your Father is so rich, why hasn't he gifted such awards to you yet?
Answer is:
      I overeat.
                   And fueling the Citation is about weight !!
It is not widely known -- but for every --
100 pound in the weight of the aircraft
(and its load) -- you need about 20 pounds
of fuel for an average trip.
Why would just overeating matter enough to be disqualifying somehow, and it seems as you're remaining at a rel8ively low and steady weight, if that's what matters?
And -- for every 20 pounds of fuel --
that you take on -- you need an
additional 4 pounds of fuel to --
take care of the weight of that fuel.
Makes sense.
I am currently about 44 pounds overweight.
That adds about an extra 9 pounds --
of fuel required.
And -- truly -- the weight thing --
is not about jet fuel or money.
It's about faith.
In what ways would non-ideal weight be about faith (or presumably lack thereof)?
Another grreat question !!
Thank you.
Most people think "faith" is a head-thing.
It is not.
James makes that quite clear in the
2nd half of the 2nd chapter of
his epistle (letter).
People talk about "faith" as if
it is a noun.  But (as James says) --
and Yeshua taught -- "faithing" --
is an action.  And -- if you are not --
acting on your (supposed) "faith" --
then ::: you ain't got it.
An un-faithing faith --
is no faith at all.
And -- clearly -- in the area of
"eating properly" -- Pip's Dad --
is faithless.
Thank you for trying to explain that to me.
You're welcome.
            "trying" ??
Did I not do it well ?
I remain rather perplexed about it though. I understand "faith" to primarily be "belief based not on reason but hope or wish" so then making it into a verb of "faithing" as acting upon it being necessary, I don't see how it's good or justifiable to expect "acting based on unreasonable beliefs" to be required for something.
Wow.
That is a very "full" paragraph.
I shall "attempt" to respond to it.
I don't know if I am love. I don't think faith is what I do. Hope might be one of my carrots still though.
All beliefs are unreasonable -- until --
Okay. Thank you for attempting to respond.
one has pretended that the belief is valid enough --
to walk it into one's life -- and thereby finding --
that it is a good belief -- because  :::  it worked.
It proved itself.
The word "belief" is a synonym for the word "faith".
No. I don't think any of this makes sense.
The word "belief" comes from --
Faith is belief in the absence of reason.
the word "believe" -- which happens to --
Normal beliefs are based on reasons though.
be (simply) a slight alteration of the word --
Some beliefs don't remain unreasonable until they're pretended to be valid enough.
They're reasonable because there are good reasons to hold them.
"be-live".   If one truly believes something --
the proof of that "belief" is in the fact that --
he is "living" it. 
To be-lieve -- is to be-living -- that which one is hoping for.
I especially like one thing you said.
You said  :::
No. Beliefs for me are things I be-living, but they are *not* based merely on my hopes.
       Faith is belief in the absence of reason.
And I say  :::  "Yes."        Assuredly Yes !!
If you act upon reason -- you are acting not --
I think faith is a neg8ive tr8, while normal belief (based upon reason) is essential and good.
upon something which you believe -- but --
(instead) upon something that you know.
Knowledge is based on reason.
Faith is based on hope.
Surely all of these concepts are rel8d in various ways, but I am of the strong opinion that both knowledge and the rather similar good typical form of belief are both based primarily on sound reasons.
Go on please.
Faith being beliefs based on hopes or naivete or wishes or hallucin8ions or dreams etc. seem to be bad unjustifiable problematic beliefs for people to hold (in many senses, even if they also confer some minor benefits to various parties).
I think unreasonable belief (faith) is bad, while other belief remains mostly good (largely because reason is fundamentally more good than not).
ok
Thank you.
You're welcome. Thank you too, for helping me learn more from your perspectives on such matters.
You're welcome.
Just keep asking questions.
Not only of me (and others) --
but especially of your self.
Wisdom is within you.
Seeking it within --
is the road to its discovery.
I intend to keep asking questions of all (including myself). I think a lot of wisdom may be discovered by seeking it within me, but maybe even more might be findable outwardly, beyond me (in some meaningful senses).
I agree.
Aren't some people *not* "Love"? What of people who *don't* do faith?
Love (agape) is a spirit.  An attitude.  And inclination.  A leaning.  A proclivity.
And everybody loves (agape).
Not all the time.
But at some times.
But doesn't "agape" mean all-the-time and unconditional?
Love has (usually) nothing whatsoever to do with faith.
"agape" does mean unconditional -- yes --
but it does not mean all-the-time.
We stray into and out of various spirits --
If it's not all-the-time, isn't that then a condition though?
throughout our days.
No -- a conditional love has to do with a quality (or characteristic) of the recipient.
Attitude and spirit have quite different connot8ions. Straying into and out of various attitudes does not seem to me to be the same thing as straying through spirits.
The "philia" (kind of love) has to do with the quality (or characteristic) of its recipient.
If love isn't available or given all-the-time, that seems to me it must be another form of condition though.
As also does the "eros" (kind of love).
But the "agape" (kind of love) only has to do with the quality (or characteristic) of its donor.
"Love" which does not take into account anything regarding its presumed target and recipient, I don't think it can be understood as particularly meaningful love.
If there were unconditional love which every recipient agreed felt to them like they were being properly loved by it, then sure it could and would be meaningful across the board then.
If, however, there are any recipients of such love who do not consider what is being provided as being at all an acceptable way to show them that they are being loved, then I don't think being based solely on quality (or characteristic) of donor can be adequate to qualify as a proper identifiable love.
I even think nothing can truly be absolutely unconditional, because I see being supposedly "unconditional" as itself a condition then, which should require its own sort of exception clause to say that no conditions are yet known, except for this one suggesting it may have no others, so far.
ok
Thank you.
You're welcome.

Maybe we can conclude this chat for this week and try to pick up more on Friday August 28th at 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime.

Thanks Dad. I ‚ù§
you too.
Thank you too.
And how was your week ?
This has been a rather Xcellent week for me. How was yours?
I'm glad for you.
Mine not quite as high on the scale.
Tell me about yours please.
Well I've spent a bunch of good time working on Octology, watching challenging YouTube videos, planning for hopefully brighter future directions ahead, have played some fun video-games with a friend, did a good deal of thinking about things seeming worthy of contempl8ion, && was also thankfully able to afford to order some useful clothing, food, && other items.
Wow !!     Yes -- sounds like "Xcellent" is truly the score.
I did get a pretty substantial number of very annoying mosquito bites && a potent resurgence of my somewhat perturbing skin-rash, but those haven't troubled me too much.
üòä
I understand.   Lakes nearby tend to --
include a small plethora of mosquitos --
in the summerfime.
What's the deal with the recurring skin-rash ?
I'm not really sure. It's pretty odd actually. I think it's most likely due to some sort of allergic reaction to the scented laundry detergent or dryer sheets that were used the last time I did a load, but it might be something else that I haven't been able to identify yet.
I see.
Thank you.
You were going to say more on that ?
Hopefully it doesn't burst my skin anywhere or irrit8 too much, && will just heal && go away fine within another week or 2.
Is that usually the case ?
I'm not sure.
Ok.
When was your last occurrence of it ?
It was just barely starting to mostly go away around the beginning of this week after having been with me for the past couple. Now it's coming back in some force though. Oh well.
Ok.
Thank you.
Did you want to show me your new wardrobe ?
It hasn't arrived yet. Probably won't get here for another week or 2. I'm actually almost naked right now. Just wearing my boxer-shorts at-the-moment.  üòâ
Ordered the new clothes online ?
The rash && bites && heat make unnecessary clothing uncomfortable right now.
Yes.   Got it.   Thank you.
Yeah, I ordered some new Dickies work pants from Amazon, which will hopefully fit better than my older ones that are too tight in the waist now && are falling apart somewhat.
Yes.   Cloth does that.
Are the new pants 100% cotton --
or a blend ?
A blend.
Percent of polyester ?
I forget.
It's ok.
Polyester is basically a plastic.
More durable than natural fabrics --
but not as comfortable.
You mentioned:
    " planning for hopefully brighter
        future directions ahead "
Details please ?
Well the biggest way I've been doing that just today is primarily the result of having watched an almost 3-hour video by Jonathan Blow (certainly one of the best video-game programmers and programmers in general who is alive today).
The title of his talk and Question-&&-Answer session was: "Video-Games && the Future of Educ8ion" which has inspired me to attempt to take much of his advice && guidance by trying to develop Octology much further than I had any clarity in mind before about.
He did "Braid" ?
Yes, he did, and The Witness.
He's totally phenomenal.
I'm intending to start developing all sorts of classic and new game content which might also become capable of being somewhat educ8ional, as parts of Octology ahead.
Sounds like a good idea.
Thanks. Yeah, sounds good to me too!
I've watched about 1 minute of his --
2:44:27 presentation -- and --
I like him.   I shall be watching --
the rest of it later.
Thank you so much.
üòä
Gr8. You're welcome. Please feel free to e-mail me afterward, if you have any thoughts worth sharing about it. I'm eager to keep considering his messages && encouragement further.  üòä
Roger.
Wilco.
Do you have anything on your PCA for this evening?
Just 1 -- but I don't think it is important.
How about you ?
Anything on your PCA ?
Nothing I can think of for now.
Ok.
You picked up some food (you said).
Challah too ?
What else of interest ?
No challah this week either. Some of the food I also ordered online (Long Kow's delicious Crystal Noodles), which also probably won't arrive for another week or 2.
"Crystal Noodles" ??
Not familiar with those.
Educ8 me please ?
They're gr8. Beppu-san turned me onto them.
But not avail in stores ?
HTTPS://Amazon.Com/s?k=Crystal+Noodles&ref=nb_sb_noss_2
I love their Spicy Tofu flavor && actually all of the flavors are pretty good except for the Sesame Paste one that's not to my liking. I will also be trying some of the Kimchi flavor too, once they're delivered.
Gr8.
Let me know how that goes please.
These 2 look interesting to me.
Of course -- your Dad doesn't go --
for the spicies.
Have you had either of these 2 (above) ?
Yep. Both are stupendous.  üòä
Gr8.   Thank you.
I have 11 varieties on my screen.
But -- I don't see any "Sesame Paste".
The Kimchi looks good too.
You've had that before ?
I think it's one of the ones in the Variety Pack, the only flavor I don't like out of the 6 offered in that.
I don't think I've had Kimchi before yet.
Looking forward to it though. Expect it will be spicy && quite tasty.
I think I'm on the wrong website.
I'm on  :::  https://crystalnoodle.com/products/
I'm going to go to the Amazon link you sent me.
There's no "variety pack" on the site I'm on now.
Ah yes.
This is it -- yes ?
Yup.
$ 18 -- Amazon.
Thank you.
Had John gotten it online -- or in a store ?
Not sure. At least online. Maybe stores in Los Angeles carry it near him too, I'd bet.
Hmm.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Do I understand that these are --
bean-based noodles -- not flour ?
I don't know.
Ah ha.
After reading more on "crystalnoodle.com" --
I find that the answer to my question is "yes".
Bean-based noodles are "gluten free" --
which means:  no wheat, no rye, no barley.
Yes.   I believe bean-based noodles are --
nearly transparent -- almost like --
strands of glass.   Does this seem right --
to you -- from your experience with this product ?
Yes, it surely does.
Gr8.   Thank you.   Again -- ye be my rabbi.
üòä
Welcome.
So do you care to share any parts of your week with me?
lol
Interesting question.
I'm not very happy with me of late.
I have things which (I tell myself) are important --
to me -- and that I want to accomplish -- but --
I am not willing to put forth the effort to --
bucket down -- and attend to them.
Undisciplined.
The "DFLI" syndrome -- I call it.
Whoops.
The "IDFLI" syndrome -- I call it.
   I   Don't   Feel   Like   It
So.
I find various "worthless" other activities --
some of which are even more than "worthless" --
which are actually detrimental to me.
Like overeating -- for one.
Excessive You-Tube movie watching --
is not always "detrimental" -- but it --
certainly steals time from things which --
( I say) I wish to accomplish.
These are the 2 biggies -- that I substitute --
for doing the things on my "agenda" list --
which actually do have some real positive value.
(//)
/bucket/  /buckle/
Hmm. Well I hope you can discover better ways to help you keep better focus on more positive things than those that can be instead more detrimental.
               Thank you for that prayer.
          Me too.
I should see "being locked into my apartment" --
as a gift.   And -- on the surface -- I do.
It might be a mistake to call my hope a prayer. I don't believe in a God.
But -- I am not using it as a true gift.
Is your "hope" for your Dad sincere ?
Do you say that you "hope" good things --
for me -- because you care about me ?
Yes, sincere hope. Prayer though, I don't think so.
I believe that you do.
Prayer is (generally) merely words -- expressed --
about a hope.   Either for one's self --
or -- for someone you love.
Prayer implies some kind message or request by faithful believers to their God.
Actually -- hopes, wishes, and all that similar
I have almost no faith, && don't find sufficient reasons to believe in any gods.
stuff -- has nothing to do with whether --
a God exists or not.   Hopes & wishes are --
simply about human longings.
Hopes and wishes are not the same as prayers. Prayers *do* have to do with gods.
               I stand corrected.
Thank you.
Let me restate my "bad" comment.
You said:
Of course. Please go ahead, whenever you'd like to.
Hmm. Well I hope you can discover better ways to help you keep better focus on more positive things than those that can be instead more detrimental.
Thank you for your hope -- and for encouraging --
me to focus on gooder doings Pip.
          Thank you.
Yet.
You're welcome. I do wish for you to focus on doing gooder, for both of our sakes, && everyone else's somewhat too.
Now that I think about it --
What you said to me -- was you pleading with me --
encouraging me -- pressing me -- requesting of me --
to do something for you, for me, and for the world --
which would be of value to all of us.
You were not asking some not-existing spirit in the sky to do something --
you were asking your Dad to do something.
You were praying to me.
Requesting something of me.
Asking me to focus.
Asking me to be true to my true self.
And I thank you for that.
(//)
You're welcome. Self-improvement is usually quite worth concerted focus.
I absolutely agree.
Piece of Light #28 is (has been) escaping me of lste.
I hear you.
Hopefully -- I shall soon put legs on your wishes for me.
Thank you Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
I love you too Dad.
Thank you.

Would you ever consider buying yourself a Sony PlaySt8ion4 with SoulCaliburVI so that you && I could play it online together sometimes?
I don't know.
Thank you for asking.
It could be fun.
Noted.
Thank you.
Yup.
Do you think of, or ever even perceive of, time as being non-linear... like curving or coiling && folding back on itself in some ways at some times?
I do.
I believe that Albert tried to explain --
Interesting. I've been pondering this question somewhat l8ly.
that a bit to us.   But -- although I have played --
with the idea somewhat -- I can't quite --
get it to lodge into my comprehension.
Did you wish to help me with it ?
Yes, if I can.
Good.   Go on please.
I seem to have discerned, observed, && experienced it apparently doing such things on usually pretty rare && weird occasions.
Example please ?
It seems to me to generally be a complex && confounding, unsettling && troubling, disorienting && problematic sort of thing when it may be occurring.
GOP
Go On Please.
A few times I've felt as if I've been temporarily trapped in strange time-warps that deposited me into similar, but still unfamiliar && somewhat unrecognizable periods of the past.
It also seems to occur for me somewhat more frequently in smaller && less conspicuous ways.
I think it's probably indic8ive of problems or powers being abused or mis-applied in some ways.
I tend to expect that it is best if it remain almost exclusively, predictably, && reliably linear.
Even when it might be feasible to manipul8 it for personal gain, I consider it best not to meddle with what could cause such potentially far-reaching consequences && maybe even catastrophes.
That's reasonable -- I think.
Maybe I'm somewhat wrong about that though. There's some notions that I may be thinking about it over-cautiously or pessimistically when it could be a strength && possibly used for more good than ill.
Any ideas on how ?
Not sure exactly, but perhaps with proper discretion, some time-bending or looping back into && over earlier periods could provide people with somewhat fresh opportunities to harness certain possible life paths which had been passed over inadvertently during an earlier phase of encounters.
GOP
For a rather concrete, but maybe somewhat mild, example of what I might be talking about, pretty frequently when I'm watching videos being streamed online to me, I often recognize quite peculiar responsiveness from subjects who seem often uncannily capable of seeing me seeing them somehow through their video-camera && across time && space. They often look away uncomfortably && even lose their train-of-thought && speech for a moment while they might appear to be having to recoil from the impact of my direct gaze upon them && especially when I've peered directly && deeply into their eyes.
Yes -- and ?
It's like somehow they recorded a video some time ago, but while they had been doing so, they were capable of perceiving me in the future watching them eventually, when I l8r do... && I can see them seeing me in what ought to be the settled past to me. They often also appear to be staring at me much of the time that I happen to be looking away from them, but then avert meeting my gaze just as I become about to re-focus on them. It's pretty odd.
Seems odd - yes.    But it is not.
It may be happening with a somewhat slowly, but steadily increasing regularity. I'm trying to make progressively better sense about why && how such things could be occurring, && what it may portend, what its consequences && significance might become best understood to be.
Ok.
Let's start with -- there is no God.
But -- you exist.
Agreed ?
Yes, sort of.
Whoa.
Sort of ?
I'm almost entirely certain that I exist (for most intents && purposes). I don't find sufficient reason to believe that God exists, however He might && I just can't determine that He does well enough yet.
Ok.   Let's set His possibility aside for a while.
Ok ?
Ok.
Good.
Now.    I'm going to cite something from Judaism --
but only as an idea.
When asked to state the primary idea in all of --
Judaism -- our Rabbi at the Synagogue in Tarzana --
that I took you, and Ange, and Tim to --
said:   "God is One."
Now -- I want to start with that idea --
but I want to remove the "God" part from it.
So --
I then want to suggest that humanity is one.
Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai Eloheynu. Adonai Echad.
That you and I are one.
That you and John are one.
That you and Danny are one.
You and Tim.
You and Ange.
And on and on.
And if one -- then all of your separate --
skin-suits -- though visually seeming 00
whoops
In some ways I can be thought to be one with any other individual (or many others), but I think there are probably significantly more ways in which I am distinct && sepR8 from others. It seems more correctly most of the time to understand that I am one, && any other person is another, such that we together are two.
/00/  /--/
to be separate -- are (instead) one.
This is essentially what Axiom #26 says.
We are one.
That is  :::  we are all connected.
You said:
What do you mean by this "one" then? Why would I visually seem sepR8 from any other person if we were meaningfully merely unified or the same in some presumably more fundamental sense?
I'm trying to make progressively better sense about why && how such things could be occurring, && what it may portend, what its consequences && significance might become best understood to be.
And -- what I just shared is merely my --
comment to that which you said (which I just copied here).
Ah. Okay.
Thank you. I'll try to think about how that might be a useful comment about what my experiences could be indic8ing. Could you please also attempt to answer my 2 further questions which were just entered?
Yes.
I think I'll do (not "attempt") the first one first.
You asked:
" What do you mean by this "one" then? "
I do not mean:  1 person (as in "one skin-suit).
But -- I do mean:  1 essential entity.
Now.  The second question:
You asked:
" Why would I visually seem sepR8 from any other person if we were meaningfully merely unified or the same in some presumably more fundamental sense? "
Why ?
There are a number of Xcellent reasons for that "seemery".
And the top one is  :::  for the fun of it.
For the interaction.
Playing by oneself is ok for a time.
But -- playing with playmates is far more enjoyable.
Hmm. Well let's back-track a bit first though. How are you && I just 1 essential entity?
You're typing.   I'll w8.
What entity are we? How is this entity essential?
We (all people / all skinsuits) are essentially the same.
Basic likes / dislikes / desires / et cetera.
I can go on -- but you want to comment here ?
How are "basic likes / dislikes / desires / etc." qualified as "essentially the same"? I think my essence is primarily unique && predominantly *not* just what's basic, default, && common.
I think "essence" is not "basic". It's the purest components that define or describe me idiosyncratically.
You "Philip Alexander Stuart" are a unique member of our one body (entity).   There is no other like you.   There never has been.   And there never will be ever again.
But you are a unique member.
You are not the entire body.
A hand is not an elbow.
A hand does not do what an elbow can do.
Nor does the elbow, what a hand can do.
So too you, Philip.
You are a unique member of the body.
Forever.
Always.
I am a unique member of the human species. But of "our one body (entity)"? I don't discern how. What is this entity? How is it singular? How am I a member of it?
Go ahead Philip.   Answer those questions.
You can do this.
You're using "body" && "entity" to mean "human species" in obtuse && anthropomorphized && confusing ways?
Of course I am.
The "human species" collectively can be thought of as a single element (although I don't think it's particularly intuitive or useful to do so most of the time).
I agree.
Most of the time -- not highly useful.
I am a member of the "human species"... which should probably just be called that, rather than "body" or "entity".
I don't have a major problem with that last comment of yours.
But -- there is a small problem with it.
"human species" has a plural sound to it.
My essence is what distinguishes me as unique compared with others. We are not essentially the same, merely by both being members of the "human species".
"body" and "entity" have a oneness sound to those words.
Your "memberness" is not your essence.
Your "bodyness" is your essence.
Your "memberness" is what makes you so very valuable to all of the rest of us.
We (none of us) can do what you do / think like you think / be as you be.
Just because I have a body does not mean I'm part of another larger thing which makes any sense to also call a "body", where this larger whatever it should be called is comprised of all human bodies by definition.
You are unique.
Yes. Therefore I am not the same or one with any other.
You skinsuit (human body) is not real.
I beg to differ.
It just seems real for a short time.
I don't think so.
Your oneness goes on forever.
You've got a strange definition of "real" going on there.
Yes I do.
And I am all wrong in how I think about this stuff.
If a body is not real, what is real to you then? How does my body just *seem* real (for whatever time), but not *be* real?
I don't know what you mean by my "oneness" either, so I can't determine whether I might be inclined to agree with it potentially going on forever, or not. Please clarify what you're intending to convey with that, if you care to.
My skinsuit will stop breathing -- some day.   Will the true who of me stop being at that time ?   I say no.   What does my offspring (Philip) say about that ?
If your body dies, what I consider to be truly you will then probably stop being. True me is a body. There's no true who of me without a physical real living tangible tactile spatial breathing moving blinking beating body. I don't believe there's any compelling evidence for souls or spirits being real. I consider life to require a body. It sure seems to, here in the land-of-the-living.
And that is your belief.   And you are welcome to it.   I do no share that belief.   Here is why.   After my skinsuit stops breathing -- I (the true who of me) shall live on (in you).   You will sit down with John and Danny -- and will say to them:  "Back in August of 2020 -- my Dad and I were having a discussion on various beliefs.   And we did not agree on a number of things.   One of them was when my Dad said ... ... ... ... ... "   
And when you relate that to John & Danny -- not only am I continuing to live in you -- but I am also having my life extended into Danny & John.
Barely.
/no/  /not/
Yep.
I don't consider recollection and quot8ion to be sufficient to qualify as life.
Barely.
And barely is good enough for me.
In November of 1955 -- I began teaching.
It's a metaphorical form of "living on", but is not actual life. Nor do I think whatever is remembered of you is all that likely to be the "true who" of you. You're more than words.
I have not finished yet.
Yesterday I did some more teaching (Fri Aug 28 2020).
And many --
of those 65 years of teachings --
will live on forever.
I agree that memories of people can figur8ively "live on", including teachings which may last very long (or possibly even *forever* after)... but I don't think true life exists devoid of a living body.
Fine.
You don't have to.
You may be-living whatever you choose to be-live.
If your belief works for you -- cling to it.
Why do you think merely impacting the memories of others to qualify as truly you still living?
I say that Socrates exists --
in me.
Did he know that I would say that about him ?
No.
Did he wish it ?
Yes.
Do you believe that when your skinsuit stops breathing --
that Octology will stop breathing too ?
Yes, Socrates exists in that his ideas continue to propag8 && thus his having lived && died already is remembered. He's not actually still alive though. He'd need a body to do that.
Do you hope that it won't stop breathing ?
Of course you don't !!
Socrates' skinsuit is dead.
Octology doesn't breathe. It may become my posthumous legacy, but it will not be *me* (or *it*) actually living after I may have died with any permanence.
The true him of him -- is not !!
If I die without capacity to resurrect somehow, Octology may remain as a remnant of my having lived && crE8d something worthwhile for those still living to preserve, learn about && from, && hopefully also extend further themselves, but no -- I don't think Octology's potential longevity could indic8 that I would remain meaningfully alive just through it. Living beings have bodies. Inanim8 (i.e., dead) things don't.
So be it.
I could be wrong. Maybe spirits / souls are real somehow, in a way that cannot yet be properly detected, understood, tested for, corrobor8d, relied upon, or reinforced enough to be recognized as also actually alive somehow (in spite of not retaining a body).
Maybe.
Would you like that to be so ?
Octology might eventually become an avenue by which living beings could someday transfer enough of their identity into newer bodies as older ones become uninhabitable due to senescence or other severe && critical damage.
Maybe.
Would you like that to be so too ?
If so -- design it.
Whether I would like it to be so that spirits / souls exist would depend on what defined such entities. Is it even possible or reasonable to imagine that life can be meaningful without a body? It's hard for me to imagine that it could be. For all I seem to have to go on here in this life so far, bodies are necessary. Nothing seems to be known to "live" which does not have a body.
Yes, I would like Octology to eventually facilit8 resurrection of some sufficient && meaningful form, hopefully almost indefinitely. I regularly engage in thinking about how I might design parts of Octology to become implementable && contribute to the feasibility of such a capacity.
I'm open to ideas about how it might be better designed. Please feel free to share ideas (or even concerns, conditions, etc.) you might have.
Now ?
Whenever.
You want I should share now ?
If you would like to now, please go right ahead.
I shall.
Ok.
Here is my first idea  /  first suggestion.
 
Stop courting only reasonable ideas.
 
They are tiny.  And not much fun either.
 
Alexander Bell
Thomas Edison
Wilbur & Orville
 
voice through a wire
artificial light
a machine that flies
 
all entirely (totally) crazy unreasonable ideas !!.
Whoo. I think all of your examples there *were* reasonable.
Hrumph.
Reason was needed to discover them && reasons make them work. They may have seemed crazy unreasonable, but they were not.
Only in hindsight.
And you are going to withhold your crazy ideas -- that can be a great gift unto the world -- just because they seem unreasonable to you today ?
Well ok.   Go ahead.
But I am not.
I think our capacity to reason about possibilities is what leads to most new discoveries.
I love the "un-reasonable" !!
If I can progressively grow my capacity to reason better && more about increasingly complex scenarios && problem-spaces, the gr8r the likelihood that I can bring gr8 gifts into the world.
          And I know you will.
                         I pray you will.
     Whoops.
            Sorry.
Indeed, some ideas can be mistaken to be unreasonable due to them not yet being capable of being connected to anything tangible through the process of applying available reasons to get there. Thus they can be unfortun8ly overlooked.
                                      I hope you will.
Do not overlook the gr8ness within you Pip.
I believe in you.
üòä
Thanks Dad. I try not to overlook my own gr8ness (or any other gr8ness for that matter).
I believe reason is fundamental to almost every breakthrough discovery.
                                   Noted.
I recognize that it can be productive to sometimes indulge unreasonable ideas, but I think this activity is primarily useful because it contrasts with, && thereby helps clarify, that which *is* reasonable. On rare occasion, doing that may reveal actually reasonable ideas which were only errantly considered to be lacking, but this outcome would be nowhere near the norm.
Amen.
                And -- amen !!
                                                  And rare -- is what Pip be.
You're quite the rare specimen yourself there too, Dad.  üòä
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
How many people have you met in your over 77 years who were also mute as you are? And that's just one particularly conspicuous facet of your extreme scarcity.
Cute!  üòä
    Yes Siam.
So, in light of how unique we each apparently are, can you please try again to explain to me how you && I alone can be better understood in any significant ways as being "one" (&& the same) as opposed to "two" (&& distinct)?
I still don't grasp what you might be meaning by "oneness".
Thinking  ...
No I cannot.
Thank you for asking.
üòä
You're welcome. Thank you for thinking about it && considering whether you might be able to try to further explain what I'm not able to grok yet. I appreC8 your willingness && attempts.  üòä
Suggestion:
Paul gave it a shot.
16 verses.
You might try -- I Cor 12:12-27
https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12.htm
(//)
Thank you. Reading it now...
You're wLcome.
Well then starting right away in verse 12, I don't recognize how Christ is meaningfully akin to "one body" that "has many parts".
Christ is the body.
I never named it (before) during --
our discussion -- because I did not wish --
to cloud the subject with "God-stuff".
In 13, I don't know what a "Spirit" is. I don't understand how baptism forms "one body" or how a single "Spirit" can be something all had to drink (unless it mainly means alcohol of some sort).
In 14, I don't grasp how all Christians are collectively taken to be well understood as anything like a single "body".
Verse 13 is full of symbolistic language.
The word "baptized" means "immersed".
It is essentially saying that there is only One Spirit --
and that Spirit is the Spirit of God --
Yeah. Why does it use those symbols though? How do they convey that Christians are all like the interconnected && interdependent components of something at all resembling a whole "body"?
which means we are all God -- and God is One.
And -- the idea of each of us drinking the --
I see that versus 15-17 just play with the symbolism to try to obliquely indic8 how parts are not the same, but they make up a whole.
one Spirit is just another attempt at --
getting the exact same idea across.
Okay.
If "being immersed" into the Spirit --
doesn't speak to you -- maybe "drinking"
the Spirit will  -  -  -  Paul hopes.
(//)
In v18, I don't see how it can be fact that God supposedly placed every "part" in the "body", just as He wanted.
In v19, I'd also ask: If they were all sepR8 parts, where would the "body" be? Neither question makes sense. There's no real body. It's symbolism being taken too far without coherence to me.
I will respond to your v18 comment first.
Okay.
God The Father did not "place" you where He wanted you in the body.
God The Son (that is: Christ) did that.
To say it more clearly:  You (Philip) decided (chose) --
what member you wanted to be in Christ.
Doesn't v18 say that it was God (&& *not* Christ) that did the "placing"?
Good question.
This is a large problem for many people --
in determining what the Scriptures are saying.
"God" means "God collectively, all 3 Persons of the Trinity.
It is not telling us a specific Person (of the God-head).
But when it comes to the choosing of --
what member of Christ each skinsuit will --
be -- The Father asks you which/what you --
would like to be -- and then He (The Father) --
says "Amen" -- which means "So be it."
If I really got a say in having to be part of the "body" of Christ, I'm actually not that surprised that I would be the member.  üòä
Good.
In v21, the whole verse seems utterly retarded and senseless to me. Of course an "eye" can't say anything whatsoever because it has no mouth, while a head could certainly say "I don't need you!" to feet or whatever (even if it actually did need whatever), because a "head" *does* have a mouth to speak whatever it wants to. This is all as dumb as a door-nail to me.
Of course it is.
Eye  /  hand  /  head  /  feet  --  are simply examples --
of 4 members (skinsuits) in the body of Christ.
It is just telling us that even skinsuit on --
My point is these all are *terrible* examples. They take the metaphor way too far without any good sense or reason to derive from the usage of body-parts in the first place.
earth needs to be here.
Well -- I'm sorry.
I didn't write it.
Paul did.
Take up your grievance with him please.
üòä
Yeah, fine... but didn't God supposedly write it all even more than Paul?
They co-wrote it -- yes.
If when you say "God" -- you mean --
"The Father" -- then I say:  complain about
the "stupid" symbolism to Him.
And -- before you ask me to ask Him --
about it -- I say to you:  "no -- I will not go --
I sort of try to, but I don't think there's any "Him" that's listening to me... so I just basically complain to myself aloud then.
to Him on your behalf about it."   I have no --
issue with the symbolism.   It is you.  You go to Him about it.
That is perfect Pip.
Complain to yourself aloud about whatever you wish.
The Father is in you.
And when the perfect time comes --
you will hear Him.
I have told you before -- wisdom is within you.
You need none else.
/even skinsuit/  /every skinsuit/
Supposing such a perfect time does arrive, how then am I expected to properly identify / recognize / distinguish hearing Him from hearing just any other voice that I also couldn't yet be at all acquainted with either?
Such an Xcellent question Pip !!
This is the miracle of Piece of Light #2.
When one first "gets into" praying on paper --
the experience is confusing.  There are tons ---
of questions that come up in the beginning --
weeks (and months) of this new practice.
The secret is  ‚Ä¢  keep doing it -- and
‚Ä¢  ask Your Father all of your questions.
And -- write every answer to every --
question.   And one of the tough --
parts to making any sense of any of this --
in the first several months is --
are the "answers" coming from The
Father -- or -- are they really coming --
from somewhere inside me ?
Frustrating ?  Yes.  But all a part of --
the process of learning to "know" --
His voice.
It is quite a journey.  
Not fast.
Not easy.
But  --  entirely worth it.

Okay. Thanks for all the gr8 dialog tonight, Dad. I think I'm ready to call it a night on our chatting until next Friday evening rolls around. I ‚ù§
you && hope you enjoy an Xcellent week ahead.  üòä

Sat Aug 29 02:19:02:19 -0500 2020
Thank you also for tonight.
Good one Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you Son.
September 4th is next.
Have a good weekend and another Gr8 week.
üòä
6'08-29-20 - 0319 Gtime / 0219 Ptime
Shabbat Shalom Dad.
5'09-04-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Shabbat Shalom Philip.
And how was your week ?
Rather mixed, but the latter part has gotten mostly good. Thanks! How was yours?
I'm glad to hear that.
üòä
Quite Xcellent -- thank you for asking.
And the latter half got even gooder.
Your prayer ("hope") was very powderful !!
You said:
Not a prayer.
Hope is different. I thought we went through that.
          I hope you can discover better ways to help
          you keep better focus on more positive things
          than those that can be instead more detrimental.
And -- your "hope" (non-prayer) worked.
I found myself hearing your words in
my head all week.  And -- as your are
"My Lord" (boss) -- had to obey you.
Thank you so much.
üòä
You're welcome.
Although this is not important -- I wish to
get into it anyway.   Permiso ?
Yes.
Thank you.
Here goes.
I believe that I and My Father are One.
Am I crazy for believing that ?
Yeah.
lol
Thank you very much.
If you are not your Father, you are not "One".
My Father is (said by The Bible to be) "Love".
And -- what say you ?
Am I "Love" ?
No. Love is not a person.
Good.
Thank you.
Next Q:
What does "love" do ?
Depends.
Which "love" are you asking about?
Either agape or philia -- or both.
Are those nouns, verbs, adjectives, or something else?
Well -- in the question "What does love do ?"  --
the "love" is a noun.
Do you consider agape to be somehow "unconditional"?
I consider agape to only be conditioned (dependent)
on the qualities (or characteristics) of the donor --
not at all -- on those of the recipient.
What are those donor qualities?
Good question.
Answer:  affection for the other person.
How do you conceive of philia being different?
The "philia" love is dependent (conditioned) --
on the qualities (or characteristics) of the recipient.
Those being?
Depends.
We can ("philia") love different things (nouns).
The standard "noun" categories are:
  ‚Ä¢  people
  ‚Ä¢  places
  ‚Ä¢  things
 
Examples would be:
  ‚Ä¢  Angie Renee
  ‚Ä¢  San Luis Obispo
  ‚Ä¢  Mom's chicken kiev
Philia-love is (usually) about --
what the thought of the recipient --
does for me.
Did I answer your last question ?
Maybe not.
GOP
You seem to have indic8d that agape is only about your affection for another person, irrespective of any of their qualities. Can that one be toward noun things too, beyond just people?
I believe so.   A love for things (and places) --
although it can (also) be philia --
I can agape (love) things (and places) --
purely out of my respect for them.
For example:
The earth.
The sky.
Rivers, streams, oceans.
Of course -- this is about preserving
(not polluting) them.
Can you start that whole text over please? It doesn't rEad properly to make sense.
"A love for things -- although it can be philia -- I can agape things -- purely out of my respect for them."  What?!
Ok.  I'll try to say it a little differently.
Wait!
Ok.
I'm w8ing.
What do em-dashes ( "--" ) mean when you use them?
The quoted sentence doesn't make sense.
I usually use em-dashes to indicate "a pause in speech" --
sort of like a comma -- but a pause lonnger than a comma.
But --
In "chatting" -- I also use them at the --
end of any given line -- to indicate that --
there is more to come.
Dumb.
Ellipses are better for that.
Yes I am.
You are correct.
I do not like ellipses ... -- because --
they are not so seeable.
Or just type a whole sentence together at once, and not need either. You're communic8ion is too stilted, broken, fragmentary, and then often disjointed and fails to parse coherently.
Ok.
Thank you.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're welcome.
Do you have difficulty seeing ellipses?
I do.
Could you get glasses that would help you with that?
Probably not.   I have attempted to do so   But my vision problems are multi-typed -- and what I seem to need is something like 20x magnification and super-high contrast.
Ah. I'm sorry to hear that detailed sight is such a significant challenge for you. I hope you can discover and attain some solution to that issue ahead.
An 48-foot by 27-foot computer monitor would help.
üòä
Can you try to find a better "Magnifier" program than the default one that I think you previously indic8d was inadequ8 to meet your zooming needs?
I'd love huge displays too. Hopefully eventually we'll both become capable of acquiring enough of them to improve the amount of computer output we can clearly discern.
Yep.
So.   Tell me about your "gotten mostly good" week please.
Are you sure you want to discard the previous topics which haven't been dealt with well yet, and instead start in on my description of some of my past week?
Postpone, yes.
Are you up for sharing past week stuff now ?
Some.
Ok.                   Some is acceptable.
Thank you.
I've been thinking a lot about various descriptions of presumed to be supernatural beings and arguments for and against those and other religious, philosophical, and ethical topics.
I've also been planning and have started describing 2 new side-projects that I intend to attempt to get rolling ahead.
I've also spent a bunch of time traversing all sorts of complex assoC8ions between people, places, things, names, lyrics, games, movies, etc. often causing me to burst into uproarious laughter when striking upon various hilarious phrasings and clever meanings. Some has been poignant too. It has been interesting, challenging, sometimes quite fun, and also somewhat less frequently disturbing or concerning.
Of my plans to start 2 new projects, the first I'm thinking of calling something like "Infinite Games", which would probably become a sub-set of my main Octology project on GitHub.
It would be to develop open-source code and art assets to basically re-implement many classic arcade and home-console video-games before next summer arrives.
Sounds interesting.
My second project would be to work on developing video content for a YouTube channel which fE8ures me as "PedantPip", who meticulously breaks down arguments into even very minute details.
Ah so.
Do you (now) have a YouTube channel ?
Yes. "PipStuart" is the account name under which my existing YouTube channel can be found. I might start a sepR8 new one for "PedantPip", or just partition it under my existing one.
There are very many things I want to become particularly productive working on and toward ahead, and especially intensely hopefully throughout most of the coming Winter.
I see 9 uploads.
Is that correct ?
3 are your Pittsburgh thing.
I only see 7 on my channel. Maybe you're seeing 2 more than me somehow. Not sure why that might be occurring.
Sorry.   Yes.   I get 7 too.
2 non-Pip are interlaced.
What was your week like?
Grreat !!
Highly productive.
In all areas.
Quite moderate eating.
Very nice! Glad to hear that.
Very minimal YT movies.
Some days = 0.
I fasted one day this week.
I'm back to taking showers more often than once every 3 weeks.
That "I like myself" on my walls -- is becoming truer and truer.
I'm happy with the "past week" me.
üòä
Thank you for asking.
üòä
You're welcome.
What camera did you use on your "Darjee" YT ?
Probably the one on the back of my Samsung GalaxyS8 mobile phone.
And the same on the Garbage Pail Kids ?
Yep.
How many cameras do you have -- other than the Galaxy & the one on your computer ?
Just one other that's tiny and connects via USB, like the one connected to my main computer (Oni), just smaller and without any legs to stand. Probably pretty low quality capabilities compared with my other ones.
So -- 3 total ?
4. Phone has 2. Front is poor. Back is strong.
Ok.   Good.   4.   Thank you.
So the "Oni" one is the best ?
Maybe. The phone's back one might be somewhat better. Not quite sure yet.
You used the Galaxy-back for the 3 Darjee videos ?
Oni's one has a tripod stand and can pivot-swivel the top though, so that part might make it best regardless of the technical specs.
Probably.
And the Oni one for the 3 Pittsburgh videos ?
No. Zoom screen-capture plus Oni's main for my face in the corner.
I mean: Yeah.
Yes -- that's what I meant.
Sorry. Misreadd it.
Can you get "landscape" instead of "portrait" from the Galaxy -- or would that just capture "portrait-sideways" ?
Not sure yet. Would have to play around with it and test more.
Ok.
Just thinking about high-quality video for your upcoming YT projects.
There are tons & tons of schlock YT things out there.
Thanks. Nice of you. Yeah, I'll try to do the best I can with what I have to work with so far.
Their content is interesting -- but their lack of technical quality is very distracting.
And -- when I say "technical quality" -- I mean  ‚Ä¢  video quality (sometimes)  ‚Ä¢  audio quality (frequently)  ‚Ä¢  and other things (which we shall discuss further at the appropriate time).
Right on.
You're welcome.
Anything on your PCA ?
Not really. Was somewhat intending to mention "NfN8gAmz" and "PedantPip" new project ideas with you, which I've already done above.
s/with/to/;
Ok.   Thank you.
Are you going to ask about my PCA ?
Yes. What remains on your PCA?
Oh.  Ok.  Thank you for asking.
üòä
5 items.
2 covered.
3 remaining.
Ready for first one ?
Yes.
Okeedoke.
Thank you.
Here comes.
 
                              My Bad Clock
  
For quite a few weeks now -- my clock
stuff has been wrong.  In fact -- I had
put the subject on my PCA a couple of
weeks ago -- wanting to discuss it with
you.
However (this week) I remembered you
telling me (a while back) that some things
which I ask of you -- could (possibly)
be answered more fully by going online.
So -- Thursday evening (Sep 3) I did that.
Without sharing all the detailia -- the
bottom line is -- that my "clock stuff"
is no longer 2 minutes slow.  Sorry for
my suggesting (by my chat time-stamps)
that yours and mine didn't agree.
               It was mine that was incorrect.
üòä
(//)
It's fine. I knew that was most likely the case. Glad you could figure out how to fix yours.  üòä
Me too.   Thank you.
Ready for next item ?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
Here comes.
 
            Weather Report
 
We have had hints that September is about to arrive.
In the past 4 days -- the temp is down slightly
-- but the humidity is still rather high.
But both need to become lower before "September"
can be (officially) declared to have arriven.
H'ever.  The forcast says that tonight's low will
be in the upper 50s -- and that will be the first
time we have seen that -- since May.
In the long range forecast -- it appears that
next Friday (Sep 11 2020) will probably be
the "official" beginning of what I (generally)
call "September Weather".
 
[end of Weather Report]

Thanks.
wLcome.
3rd?
Ah yes.
I believe we have a "3" in the house.
Here comes.
 
                      Never Been To Europe
 
I've never been to Europe.
  
I've been to Hawaii (in 2008).    I gave
it to myself as my 65th Birthday Present.
And I've been to Canada -- twice.
      1958 - Niagara Falls -- with parents
      1986 - Vancouver (Expo 86) October (with me)
And I've been to Southeast Asia (1966-67)
    ‚Ä¢  Taiwan
    ‚Ä¢  Viet Nam
    ‚Ä¢  China (Hong Kong)
But -- I've never been to Europe.
Daddy was in the 1940s.  Germany I think.
Mother was.  Scandinavia (I believe).
    1980s ?           Not sure when.
But me -- never.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Back in the 80s -- I was thinking about where
I'd like to visit.  There were quite a few
places in the USA -- and by now -- I have done
many of them -- but many are yet to do.
The biggie of those is "The Henry Ford Museum"
in Michigan.  But there are a number of others
too -- like South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, and
Idaho -- which are 4 of the 6 states which I have
never been to.  The other 2 are Michigan & Alaska.
However -- also in this "where I'd like to visit"
thinkery -- (in the 80s) the 2 primes were:
  
  ‚Ä¢  Hawaii
  ‚Ä¢  Paris
  
Well.  I did Hawaii (the Island of Kauai) in October
          of 2008.  Truly "The Vacation of a Lifetime" !!
        And since then -- the "Paris" idea has
        become considerably less important.
But -- I do think about Europe from time to time.
In fact -- on Wednesday (Sep 02) -- I spent about
4 hours researching Europe stuff -- and got quite
involved in it -- especially the geography -- which
has always been a great interest to me.  ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  I've
loved geography ever since I first started studying
it in gradeschool.
And (in that "Wednesday" research) I wrote up a bunch
of stuff on European geography.  I thought maybe I'd
share it with you tonight -- but (later) thought it
would probably bore you to death.
H'ever, I will share the map with you -- because of what
I'm going to say about "where I might like to visit" --
in the remainder of this essay.  ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  Here 'tis.
 
  
     There are 45 countries in Europe.
 
And of those 45 -- there are about 6 -- which are of
some particular interest to me.  I believe I have listed
them here -- in my approximate order of interest:
 
    ‚Ä¢  Greece
    ‚Ä¢  Switzerland
    ‚Ä¢  France
    ‚Ä¢  Italy
    ‚Ä¢  UK (especially Scotland & England)
    ‚Ä¢  Ireland
 
 
Yet.  If I never get to see any of them
(while breathing) -- I shall not find
myself lamenting over that too much.
 
                        [end of essay on Europe]

Thanks.
You're welcome Pip.

I ‚ù§
 you more Pip !!
Thank you.
Well I think maybe we can wrap things up for this week and probably re-connect again next Friday evening. Hope you experience another good productive week ahead.  üòä
I hope the same for you Pip.
Next Friday sounds like a plan.
Thank you for tonight.
Have I told you lately that I ‚ù§
 you ?
Well.   If not -- I ‚ù§

5'09-11-20 - 2011 Gtime / 1911 Ptime
Same to you My Lord.
üòä
How was your week ?
Umm, first I'm no "Lord". Would your "Father" approve of you referring to another as an upper-case "Lord" (or yourself as u-c "My")? It's pretty weird that you have taken to doing so. I am a man. I expect you are too. Why do you do this, and how do you justify it?
I thought I had explained this before -- but apparently insufficiently.
So -- as you are my boss -- and you have requested it -- I shall do it again.
Thank you for asking.
Here 'tis.
The word "lord" means "boss".
The capital "L" that I use -- when I apply it to you -- is simply a matter of respect for who you are -- which is quite similar to the capitalizing of the first names of any person.   If I were to address you as "pip" or "philip" -- that would seem to me to lack respect for you.
Doesn't upper-case "Lord" imply "God" though, more than merely some typical proper-noun like "Pip"?
I am aware that it is a popular notion to believe that the word "lord" is a synonym for the word "God".   But I do not see it as such.   The word "lord" simply means "boss" -- and a boss is anyone who one serves.
Thank you for clarifying that again. I struggle with the connot8ions of many things that seem somehow objectionable or disagreeable to me in their typical expressions and meanings or implic8ions and maybe also ramific8ions.
It can be an employer -- it can be a customer -- it can be a teacher's student -- it can be a family member -- it can be a friend -- this list goes on and on.
You are welcome.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
You may ask me anything.
And re-ask me whenever you wish.
I reciproc8 that sentiment, thinking probably almost no question which might occur to you should be unacceptable. I'd like for you to be and feel able to ask me anything as well.
Thank you Pip.
Thank you. If I find more to query you about it, I will ask when my next opportunity arises.
I ‚ù§
 you.
I ‚ù§
you too.
Good.
Thank you.
Okay, well I've had a rather profoundly challenging week. I've been turning over in my mind many deep thoughts about what may be appropriate to aspire for. I've also been facing some rather disturbing realiz8ions and coordin8d impositions.
GOP
I'm not sure whether I can delve into too many of the details of those matters with you yet, as I'm still needing time to mull them over further and hopefully stabilize my thinking and how I might best convey or characterize them once I've done so sufficiently.
I can say that I'm not particularly worried about them, but am needing to reflect on, and probably somewhat significantly revise, my earlier aspir8ions and intentions.
Ok
Thank you.
You're welcome.
üòä
How was your week?
Mixed.   Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.  üòä
Care to share why you found it mixed?
I shall.
Some parts were undisciplined.
H'ever -- I did spend about 20 hours on the drafting of a number of FTR Scripts.   So I was happy about that.
Well it should be usually okay to be rel8ively undisciplined some of the time. Drafting FtR Scripts for about 20 hours sounds like you've probably done some significant work though too. How do you feel about the progress you're making there, besides just being happy about it?
I feel good about the progress of drafting FTR Scripts.   It's encouraging.   The typical output of those is usually 3 or 4 per week -- which translates to about 175 per year.   And that is nice.   ¬∂   When this Covid-19 gift winds up -- and we begin to do FTR Seminar -- I shall have tons and tons of Scripts in my files.
/Seminar/  /Seminars/
The titles of the 4 Scripts done this past week were:
  ‚Ä¢  Haste & Waste
  ‚Ä¢  Satisfaction
  ‚Ä¢  Santa 2 - God 1
  ‚Ä¢  Philosophy vs Religion
 I don't know if now is the best time to bring this up, but I've spent some time reflecting on your "29 Pieces of Light" as well as the minority of "FarFar's 27 Axioms" that you've made available to me so far... and I have some concerns and complaints which might be worth discussing and addressing somewhat, if not now then probably eventually. I've also seen a powerfully moving video by James Jani contextualizing and criticizing self-help / self-development rather generally, which may also warrant some concerted engagement with at some point too. What do you think about these?
You may launch into either or both whenever you wish.   Now is fine.
Okay. Well maybe we can start with PoL#6. "FarFar's 27 Axioms" are mentioned as a single entry on your publicly published ILoveThis.Org site, but it seems unfair or unjustifiably coy or covert or something to restrict provision of these Axioms to only when you consider them to be needed, but remain unwilling to provide the whole list in its entirety for consider8ion and scrutiny and evalU8ion and dissemin8ion (if indeed they contain valuable advice, instruction, wisdom, etc.).
Would you please re-consider filling in my 14 vacancies out of the 27? I'm missing 2 through 5, 7, 9 through 13, 20, 21, 24, and 25.
Response to Paragraph #1:
Thank you.   I hear that.
Response to Paragraph #2:
Is there a particular reason to suggest to someone that they might do something that they are already doing ?
Yes. If your Pieces of Light are meant to be public, yet some of the details are kept secret or obscured, then the whole meaning, significance, context, etc. described by them is porous and partially impotent unnecessarily. Please recognize that if 29 PoL are to be taught and shared, then so too ought to be their interpret8ions and details, so that the list is comprehensible and able to be challenged and critiqued within the broader context.
On point #1 - Noted.   Thank you.
On point #2 - thank you for that observation.   I shall devote some further mullery to that.
You're welcome. In case we become unable to continue chatting online together weekly (or at all regularly over some other dur8ion), it would disappoint me substantially to have obtained only less than half of all your "Father's" Axioms. Even if you see them as merely suggestions which are pointless to share when being in regards to things they already seem to be doing, you overlook the likelihood that your codific8ion of them as a somewhat cohesive prescription for understanding and something close to idealized behavior can be useful to ponder together. They're likely prioritized somewhat. Assessing the extent of ordered significance (and other characteristics) of the completed set is an undue frustr8ion when attempting to learn more from them (or about you, or both), as well as attempting to commit them to memory and interpret and implement them in any unified fashion.
Thank you Pip.   Many of your concerns and feelings -- I (also) have had myself.   I have had to work my way through them -- and find peace -- in spite of not being given all of the information that I have requested.   Why is this ?   He has told me bits and pieces of the answer to that -- but far from all that I have asked of Him.   This (quite apparently) is a part of getting to know Him.
What about getting to know you and your Points of Light? Why include #6 as Axioms that should be "light", but that you keep in the "dark"?
Very interesting questions.   Actually -- those are 2 questions which are nearly exactly the same questions I have asked of Him.
Hmm. Well I put forth that "getting to know Him" is already difficult enough if one (like me) finds little compelling evidence that He exists or wields any formidable powers or could be worth struggling to get to know. If He has good reasons for Axioms to exist in a numbered set (of 27), then they ought not be concealed or dealt out only when they are not being followed properly. Instead they should be published and explained somewhat comprehensively, so He (and you) can become better known and respected through them (after they prove they can stand up to scrutiny, challenge, and critique). This is how I see it. Maybe you can ask Him if there's at least some good reasons to withhold them?
I have asked Him.   And (over time) I have gotten a number of answers.   Some of His answers are very clear.   Others are a bit fuzzy.   Some of His answers sit well with me.   Some of His answers tend to wrinkle my nose from time to time.   I guess the bottom line (for me -- although I am fully aware that this certainly is not the case for everyone) -- the bottom line (for me) is that I believe that He is wiser than I am -- and when He withholds this or that from me -- I believe that His doing so is not only because of His greater wisdom (than mine) -- but also that He knows how to love me -- and is loving me -- much better than I could possibly love myself.
Ah. Hmm. Well then, if He is so wise and loving you better than you could love yourself, why would He withhold valuable answers from you when you probably love yourself better by allowing yourself to access answers from yourself without the need for obscurity and mystery? Are you only assuming or having unreasonable faith that He is more wise than you and loves you better? How do you come to such odd conclusions (which they seem to be to me, so far)?
Three (3) great questions.
    Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
For the first Q -- I have no answer.
To the 3rd Q -- my answer is that My Father (among many other things) is quite odd.
To the 2nd Q -- the answer to this one can not be absolute.   It would always end up being a matter of one's opinion -- and different people would probably suggest many different answers.
Okay. Well I think inability or unwillingness to answer important questions about proper behavior and wisdom-seeking indic8s that your Father is not a good Teacher and not particularly deserving of respect or high regard. This type of responsiveness seems to me to be evidence of His conspicuous lack of inform8ion or dishonorable secrecy, which you're just expected to explain away as somehow more "wise" and "loving" while He exhibits less of these than you probably mostly already do for yourself. You seem to have lived the vast majority of your life faithful and loyal to Him, but your reward for this seems to be keeping you essentially in the dark about significant issues. I think He is a failure, if He can't answer sincere questions by His devout followers. Might you please be able to explain why you seem to be assuming that Him not answering you is exhibiting gr8r wisdom, as opposed to less of it?
Thank you for all of your comments and observations in that paragraph.
And now -- about the question ...
You're welcome.
Yes -- I believe I am able to explain it.
But I highly suspect that it would not be an "explanation" which you would be able to embrace.
Do you want me to send it anyway ?
Yes, please.
Ok.
Here goes.
There is a verse in Scripture (Rom 12:3) -- which says:  "Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought."   ¬∂   And -- this does apply to many of us -- at various times in our journey.   ¬∂   However.   It is my experience -- that the vast number of people that I have come across (in the past 77 years) -- have the very opposite problem -- which is:  they think of their "self" far (far) far! more lowly than they ought !!!   ¬∂   That is -- they either have no clue as to who (or what) they are -- or -- they refuse to eat the very truth of it -- for one or another of various different reasons (which I will not list at this moment -- but I could)   ¬∂   And -- along that same line -- I would add this:  Philippians 2:5 says: "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ (Yeshua)."   And then (in the very next verse) -- it goes on to explain that the reason that you are to embrace the idea of your having the mind of Christ is:  because you (just like Yeshua) are equal with/to God.   ¬∂   And here is the gigantic reason that Our Father ofttimes does not "flat-out" answer our questions.   He wants us to realize that His ability to "figure things out for His self" -- is resident within us.   And thereby -- the more that He "makes us" (leaves us to) "figure things out for our self" -- the more (and more) we become aware that He (and each of we) are One.
 
And -- in case you would like the links -- they are:
 
https://biblehub.com/romans/12-3.htm
https://biblehub.com/philippians/2.htm
I know this is a nit-pick, but it struck me when trying to process what you've written here that: If "you are to embrace the idea of your having the mind of Christ", then unless Christ had in mind the idea of having His own mind, your mental "embracing the idea" prohibits you from having His mind. We are not equal with/to God. His mind is supposedly vast and perfect, and ours seem to almost always exhibit simplicity and flaws. Okay, now I'm moving on to "the gigantic reason" sentence.
So regarding this gigantic reason, wanting us to "realize" that us figuring things out is somehow "His ability... for His self", but how is this? Even assuming we're equal with/to God, if He remains distinct from us in any way, then we are not Him, He is not us, and thus us figuring things out is not Him doing so but primarily just us. I think there might be some minor ways in which we can be said to be "One", but in most ways, no, we are 2 or 3 different beings, entities, life-forms, etc., and not best understood to be merely "One".
And that is where you are right now.
And I applaud it.
You are perfect Philip.
üòä
I don't think I'm perfect. I also insist that I'm not equal with/to God. He and I are not "One". He has a "Chosen People", collects fore-skins from new-born baby boy's genitals, commands his people to commit genocide on heathen goyim, and instructs his people on how to properly keep slaves, handle rape, atone for sins only and always by spilling blood (including human), claims He is impossible to please without gr8 unreasonable faith, and many further atrocities. He seems overwhelmingly terrible and unethical. I am mostly good, and appear to hold higher values than Him in many regards. Maybe I'm somewhat close to perfect, while God was not and is not.
And -- you wish to "stick" to that ?
"Stick to" what?
All of those statements, ideas, conclusions, and evaluations ?
If they're mostly correct, then: "Yes!" Is there any reason I shouldn't?
Yes -- there is a reason.
You want I should "pick it apart" ?
Please.
Ok.
Here goes.
(A)  You don't believe you are perfect.  ‚Ä¢  I shall leave that one go for today.  (B)  Not God's equal  ‚Ä¢  I'll suspend comments on that one too (for now)  (C)  You and He not One.  ‚Ä¢  Can w8 too.  Now (D)  Chosen People  (E)  fore-skins  (F)  genocide  (G)  keep slaves  (H)  handle rape  (I)  sin atonement  (J)  blood spilling  (K)  many further atrocities.  ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  All 8 of these are Old Testament stuff.   And He does not support these any longer.   ¬∂   Yeshua has come to say (and show) a new way -- a New Testament  (a new system)  (a new way of being, doing, and believing) -- which are un-terrible -- and quite ethical -- very good -- and holding extremely high values -- for each (and every) one of His children.
Did you perhaps miss the part of the Old Testament where all that "stuff" was part of an "eternal covenant" with His "Chosen People" though? Jews still exist and mostly reject Y'shua for good reasons. Also Y'shua was supposedly a faultless blameless human blood sacrifice for atonement in your New Testament, which indic8s He didn't deserve to suffer and die while all of us others who are presumed to be God's children would deserve punishment but can be exoner8d just by believing Y'shua paid our penalties. This may be gr8 mercy in some sense, but I am inclined to consider justice and fairness to be higher values than those (whenever feasible, and with God they should be superior options He could have chosen). Further, Christians and even just Westerners still routinely remove new-borns' fore-skins, still believe in supposedly the same God who earlier condoned and endorsed slavery and rapists marrying their victims. If God's character and values can change so drastically from Old to New Testaments, how can you have any confidence it hasn't changed much more than before over the past 2000-or-so years? I think tons of what Christians have done throughout these past couple millennia has continue in terrible traditions, primarily by honoring hopes and faith as the basis for beliefs instead of requiring evidence and good sound reasons. Crusades, Inquisitions, persecutions, fragment8ion into incompatible denomin8ions, prohibitions against scientific findings, apologetics which almost ubiquitously presume the Bible is entirely true and trustworthy, etc.. The New Testament still gave rise to a gr8 deal of terrible activities -- unethical -- not good -- ongoingly poor values -- for each who are indoctrin8d or become otherwise convinced that they are one of God's children, while unbelievers are brow-beaten that they're going to burn in Hell for eternity. I think you're trying to paint to rosy a picture there.
s/those/mercy/; s/continue/continued/;
s/paint to rosy/paint too rosy/;
Well -- I must admit --
               God has given me a pretty rosy life.
Shall I ask Him to send you some daffodils ?
                    Mom too -- come to think of it.
Go ahead. If they arrive somehow, I guess I'll try to put them in water or wine or something.  üòâ
Whine ?
Do flowers do well in blood, or wine, or grape-juice best?  üòâ
I think so.
I did knot major in botany.
I was a microphone major.
With a microchip minor.
Right on.
üòä
Well shall we call it a night and look forward again to chatting more next Friday night on Sept. 18th?
It's a knight.
I ‚ù§
you Dad, and hope you have a good week ahead. Thanks very much for the deep topics we got into tonight.  üòä
And that sound like a plan.
And thank you for this evening.
And I ‚ù§
 you Pip.

I'll have a goood week if you have a goood week.

Hi Dad.
4'09-24-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
Thank you for you emails.
I ‚ù§
 you.
You're welcome. They're pretty severe, but I think mostly serious too.
I am trying to love you too. Not quite sure how to. Maybe will learn.
Maybe.
It seems there is quite a lot we might chat about.
Where would you like to start ?
Indeed. Were you able to read through the entirety of my pasted message originally sent to Ange?
I figure you can choose wherever you might like for us to start chatting about any of it.
I was able -- yes.
For reference, besides you and Angie, I've also forwarded that message to Uncle Pat Lennon and my Van Nuys High School gr8 friend, Spencer Yaras. It's pretty vitriolic and brutal and deep and personal, so I'm trying not to circul8 it too widely yet.
Good idea.
It seems to me that Angie is not the important subject for this evening.
I would think Philip is of far greater importance tonight.
Yes ?
Probably.
Good.
I have a few questions.
Puedo ?
Yes. Just as a head's up, I probably will only be available to chat until about 9PM (my time) tonight. Hopefully we can suspend anything we've gotten into around then, and try to continue tomorrow where we might've left off.
Find with me.
What's happening at 9 (Ptime) ?
/find/  /fine/
Might be able to meet a friend online for fighting game battles and chat about game-development.
Okeedoke.
Good.
Why are you being evicted ?
4 bogus reasons. Drugs (none found). Damage to property (none). Harassing tenants (mainly just one, who has threatened to kill me several times already). Loud music at all hours (yet only one official noise-complaint so far).
I'd like to ask questions about all of those.   May I ?
Yes.
Thank you.
(A)  Drugs.  Was your place searched recently by someone ?
Scarcely, it seems. Whoever entered probably mainly just moved Darj's food away from where she could find it and struggled to turn off my music.
I'm not sure I understand.   Were you home when this occurred ?
No. There's just hints that people were here while I was kept in mental hospital.
So.  It sounds to me that -- if someone was in your apartment, while you were out -- they were inside illegally.   Do you agree ?
Probably.
Well -- help me here.   Why only probably ?    Is anyone legally allowed to come into your apartment without your permission ?
Maybe the landlord, to turn down my music? I don't know.
Ok.   When you were taken to the hospital last week -- were you "taken" from your apartment ?
Yes.
Good.
Was your music playing when they took you away ?
Yes.
Ok.
I may want to return to this one (A) later.   But now I'd like to move on to (B) Damage to property.   You say "none".   Who says otherwise ?   And what damage was specified ?
Landlord says otherwise. None specified.
Good.
Thank you.
(C) is next.   You said:   "Harassing tenants (mainly just one, who has threatened to kill me several times already)."   Help me with this one please.   Does this allege that you have harassed another tenant in your building ?
Yes. Again unspecified who, how, when, where, etc..
Ok.   But you know who this person is -- that you are alleged to have harassed -- yes ?
Downstairs neighbor, Mike Casperson. Maybe also others when my music was loud all night once.
Good.   Thank you.   And am I correct in saying that the alleged "harassment" is only "loud music" -- and absolutely nothing else ?
No. Mike threatened to kill me with a gun and then came up to me angrily and aggressively. I pushed him away and told his friends in the building to tell him that if he tries to muscle me around and keep announcing he intends to kill me, he better not try to follow through or get in my space again, because I will kill him in self-defense easily.
Did you report this event to your landlord  and/or  anyone else ?
Yes. Landlord deleted the message. I told the police repeatedly, and they consistently ignored.
Landlord deleted ??    Had you emailed him this message ?
Answering machine.
So -- you left a spoken message on his voice-mail -- correct ?
Yes.
Good.
Thank you.
URwLcome.
Now.   Message to police.    In person,   by phone,   email,   or  what other way ?
In person.
Good.   You said repeatedly.   How many times ?
Probably 4 or more.
Good.
Do you have any paperwork to prove any of those 4 times ?
Nope. No paperwork. Maybe some evidence of these on videos and audio I recorded on my phone. Haven't carefully reviewed those or uploaded them to my Google Drive account, but probably should soon.
Thank you.
I am assuming that you received your eviction notice on paper.   If I am correct about that -- will you please give me a complete (top-to-bottom) copy of its text -- plus the signature ?
Yes. Beginning transcription of it now...
Notice Terminating Tenancy
28 Day Notice
Thank you Pip.    Take your time.
Wisconsin Statutes 704.19
State of Wisconsin, Winnebago County.
To: Philip Stewart
812 Mallard Ave. #6
Oshkosh, WI 54901
This notice terminates your tenancy and requires you to remove from the following described premises on or before __10-19-2020____, which is the last day of the rental period.
Description of premises: __2_bdrm_apt____
________________________*blank_line*_________________________
__Drugs, Damage to property, harassing____
__tenant's, Loud music all ours of day's.____
Dated at: __Oshkosh____, this __22nd____ day of __Sept._2020____
_____*blank_line*_____
__Doug_Corder?____ (last name is scribbled and too difficult to discern with any clarity)
Manager / Agent
Proof of Service:
Served this __22nd____ day of __September_2020____
Time: __9:00AM____ Manner: __In_person____
Signed: __Pip_Stuart____ (but it's my cursive sign8ure, like his was above for Manager)
6/00
Those last numbers are quite small in the lower-left portion of the bottom of the sheet of paper. Maybe the original form templ8 being used was produced in June of 2000 or something.
That's all that I've received on the matter, so far.
I intend to look into lawyers who might be able to help me fight the eviction. Hopefully some tonight and more seriously tomorrow. I would gr8ly apprecE8 your help in enabling Darj and I to remain here, if possible, at least until there's another clearly better place for us to go.
So -- do I understand correctly that Mr. Corder handed it to you person-to-person -- and that you signed for it ?
Yes. He was very reluctant to provide any reasons, but I insisted that he do so, before I could sign that it had been properly delivered to me. I hope my sign8ure on it does not oblig8 me to vac8. It shouldn't, if the reasons are able to be proven invalid.
Sorry Pip.   I have been having major problems with Gmail for about 27 minutes -- but I shall continue now -- and hope it shall not be re-occurring.
üòä
Okay.
Good.   Next question:   Your rent is paid up to what date ?
Not sure. Payee (PaymentPartner) handles it.
Good.   Thank you.   Next.    PaymentPartner gets their money to pay your rent from where or whom ?
From SocialSecurityDisabilityInsurance.
Good.   And some person needs to authorize that.   Do you know that name ?
No.
Ok.   Let me try this a different way.  Your rent payment has something to do with you complying with some set of rules and/or guidelines that your psychiatrist and/or some other people involved with your case have laid down for your eligibility for that rest payment.   This is correct -- yes ?
I don't think so. Let me re-read what you just wrote and think again...
If there are rules / guidelines that my psychiatrist and people involved with my case may be involved in determining eligibility for my payee paying my landlord, I don't know about any such stipul8ions yet. I think my payee just pays my rent str8 away, without needing ongoing qualific8ion.
Well -- this was not my understanding.   You will correct me if I am wrong.   Here is what I understood were part of the things that you might do to "shut off" your monetary help from wherever it is coming from  :::  ‚Ä¢  earn too much money on your own  ‚Ä¢  travel outside of the county without prior permission  ‚Ä¢  fail to take your daily prescribed medications.
My friend might not be available until closer to 10PM, so maybe I can remain here chatting with you for almost another hour.
Fine.
I don't know if my SSDI is contingent on those things... er I mean you're probably confusing too many things together.
Go on please.
Yes, if I make more than $900-something monthly for 9 months, I will probably lose all my benefits (which are about $1600-something, paid monthly to my payee).
If I travel outside the county without permission, I may be forced to take more medic8ion, maybe forced back into another hospital, forced to obey other things. This is based on my mental health legal commitment to Winnebago County.
Part of being on commitment also includes requiring me to take all prescribed medic8ions (among a few other things). Probably similar penalty to this as just described above for leaving county.
I can get my paperwork with the commitment details, if you'd like to be informed of all of those, as written.
Ok.   Thank you.   I don't know that I need to understand all the stuff that "wraps around" your being helped out monetarily (rent & all else).   However -- here is what I wish to get at right now.  ¬∂  At this very moment (since Tuesday the 22nd) your "roof" is being threatened to become taken away.   This means Philip Stuart's welfare is being threatened.   This is for sure!  ¬∂  Next -- there are a number of people who are being paid by some government agency (or agencies) to "care" about (and for) Philip Stuart.   Among them are  ‚Ä¢  your psychiatrist  ‚Ä¢  the ladies that visit you each evening to see that you are taking your medications  ‚Ä¢  some other lady (whose name I have forgotten) who visits you periodically to check up on "how you are doing" or whatever.   There may be others -- I don't know.   But the point is:  these people are being paid to "look out for you".   And -- I believe what I am really suggesting is that one (or more) of these people should be getting involved with this "eviction" situation -- because if you are evicted -- they are not doing what their occupational "job description" says they are to be doing for Philip Stuart (and others like him).          Am I correct on this ?
Hmm. You might be. I'm not sure of every person's roles, "job descriptions", responsibilities, objectives, etc..
I think Michelle O'Neill (case-manager), and Dr. David Zerrien (psychiatrist), are the most immeD8ly significant government jobs which are supposed to "care" for me.
Yes.   Thank you.   Michelle is the name I had forgotten.
I think my landlord (Doug C.) ought to have a very good set of reasons to evict me, a legally disabled person.
And I agree.   And I think Michelle should also agree.   ¬∂   And here is my "take" on this whole thing -- based on our conversation of the past 2 hours and 18 minutes  :::  your landlord has a good reason to evict you.   But only one.   And that one is:  loud music.   And if I were Michelle -- I would go to Mr. C. -- and say:  "Mr. Stuart knows that his loud music is disturbing other tenants in your building -- and he is sorry about that -- and he has told me to tell you that he will play his music much more quietly from now on -- and that if he does not adhere to that plan -- he should be evicted."
Yeah. Sounds close to right. I disagree somewhat that loud music should be grounds for eviction, especially if I almost always keep the volume and bass down after 10PM and until 9AM, so I would probably scrap your end-clause st8ing that I should be evicted if I don't adhere to that plan... but probably pretty good. I may e-mail Michelle about this in the morning. Thanks for helping me sort this much out. I apprecE8 your assistance.
You're welcome.
Is there anything else you'd like to at least begin discussing for about 30 minutes, or would you prefer to just re-convene tomorrow evening (if we can)?
I'd like to discuss something else -- thank you.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
Is it my turn ?
Or yours ?
Yep.
Mine ?
Ok
Thank you.
How would like to stop being a legally disabled person ?
/would like/    /would you like/
If I could afford to survive at least as comfortably as I have for the past decade, yet without further legal disability, I would probably like that quite a lot. If I could eventually derive more than $1600 / Month income from p8rons who could fund me continuing to develop Octology, or for some regular YouTube content or something similar, that would probably be gr8.
Thank you.
Would the above also include your stopping being forcibly taken into mental hospitals ?
I'm probably not cut-out for M-F 9a-5p work though.
Umm, I don't understand your question.
If I liked becoming capable of earning more than SSDI benefits have been, what does that have to do with "including" no more forced hospitaliz8ions? I don't get the connection. Are you just trying to pile on more "sales" techniques of like how would I like the washer, dryer, recliner, and new car as all my prizes or something?
I'm sorry.   I probably should have asked:   what (officially) is your disability ?
Officially my disability has been "BiPolar Type I Disorder", but Dr. Zerrien originally added Poly-Substance Abuse, and has recently tried changing BiPolar to Schizo-Affective Disorder, and now these most recent hospital release papers also indic8 that they think I suffer from Schizophrenia as well. BiPolar Type I might be accur8. Others, probably not so.
Ok.   Good.   Thank you.
Do you believe that your disability (no matter what who may happen to call it) can be cured ?
I'm not sure. Maybe. Possibly. Maybe not.
Good answer Philip.
Do you know what your Dad believes about it ?
I expect you believe almost any "Disorder" can potentially become rectified and sufficiently recognizable as orderly?
I believe you will find the cure.   Your psychiatrist might help.   Some other people might help.   But none of them will cure you.   Only you will do that.   And I have no idea when.   I just know that you will do it.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
How could you know that? What makes you think you know? Thanks for declaring you love me so frequently, but I apprecE8 it more when you show it with care. I'm trying to love anyone but myself and Darjee, but it's not easy for me to do so anymore. Maybe I will find such ability again someday.
Good questions Philip.
I see that my (our) time is "up" for tonight.
Thank you for the good Thursday session.
Are we on for tom evening at 2000 G / 1900 P ?
Yes, please.
Good.
‚ù§
    ‚ù§
    ‚ù§

I guess, please try to love yourself for me.
Have a good rest-of-the-evening Pip.
You too, Dad.

Hi Dad.
5'09-25-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Shabbat Shalom Philip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
How was your last 21 hours ?
Peaceful Friday Evening to you too.
Thank you.
It was pretty good. I got back in-touch with several old friends from California and started contacting lawyers to see if they can help me fight my eviction, among a few other things.
How was your last 21 hours?
Very Xcellent.   Thank you for asking.
I didn't ask Michelle to talk to Doug for me, since I don't trust her. When I was in the hospital, both she and Angie insisted that they would be taking care of Darj and that I didn't have to worry... but neither of them did anything for Darj's needs.
Isn't Angie in Missouri ?
When I got home, I found Darj scrounging through my trashcan tipped over. She had no water or food and nobody had scooped her litter-box at all for the whole week. Darj was moaning and howling quite a bit for the first day I was back home, but then it tapered off as she re-adjusted to me taking good care of her again.
Yes, Angie is in Missouri, but said she had friends here who would care for Darj. None did though.
I see.   Thank you.
So how did you think you knew that I would find and employ a cure for my disability?
You have been on Mallard for how long now ?
5 Years.
And -- any other eviction notice in those 5 years ?
Nope.
Great.
Any complaint and/or warning about anything from your landlord in those 5 years ?
Not that I can remember, other than the restraining order Doug C. had placed on me when I got arrested last Spring of 2019.
That you "restrain" from what ?
He claimed that I had damaged the property by forcing my mailbox door open, breaking the fire-extinguisher glass (both of which remain essentially un-replaced now a Year-and-a-half later), and writing with marker on my door and the door of my downstairs neighbor (both of which have been covered by a can of spray-paint).
A restraining order means a person can't go near to another person or place.
But that was lifted later (of course) ?
They were trying to steal all of my belongings. I had to wait until the last minute in order to retain my belongings. They were pressuring me to just pick-up Darj and only what I could carry and then leave all the rest of my belongings behind for everyone else here to loot from me.
I see.
Did you do any jail time for that arrest ?
My old case-manager, Mary Grundy, got Doug to retract the restraining order on the last day that I was going to be allowed to stay at the Summit House (where I had to transition to after the mental hospital stay).
I was in jail for almost a week, I think.
And then in the hospital after the jail ?
Yes.
Ok.   How long there (in hospital) ?
About 3 weeks or so. I don't remember too well precisely how long each stay was.
Ok.   Thank you.
Doug C. is your landlord ?
Yes.
Good.
All these things should be shared with your lawyer -- so that he has a full picture -- and can represent you well.
Yeah. I will try to look at my paperwork from that time, to see if I can get more precise about each dur8ion.
Good.
Shall we return to your question to me now ?
Sure.
Ok.
You had said:
"So how did you think you knew that I would find and employ a cure for my disability?"
Just one more thing about the eviction topic. I suspect Doug C. is trying to steal my stuff again by evicting me with few opportunities to find a suitable and affordable place to move to before October 19th, when the notice says I must be out.
Thank you.   Tell your lawyer that also -- along with why you think that to be the case.
The first legal-firm I contacted replied that they couldn't help me with a housing dispute, but gave me a referral to another firm which might be able to. Hopefully I can contact them on or before Monday, to get that ball rolling early next week, if possible. I'll probably start filling out applic8ions for other rental properties nearby here too. I wish I could return to California with this potential need to move, but it unfortun8ly looks unaffordable to achieve without some reasonable income already established to supplement my inadequ8 SSDI benefits.
Good.
Yes -- I agree (that in your current situation) if a move must be made -- Oshkosh is probably a much better target (for now) than California -- in spite of how much you would prefer that locale.
No.   I have not been sleeping.
Been working on the answer to your question.
Okay.
Shall we do that now ?
Yep.
Good.   Thank you.
You asked:
"So how did you think you knew that I would
find and employ a cure for my disability?"
You and I have a number of similarities.

We also have quite a few differences.
Agreed.
But -- I mention the similarities because
our paths -- regarding various situations
(and predicaments) are quite a bit the
same -- with regard to many things.
I (therefore) am extremely familiar with
the nature of many things that you find
yourself going through -- in addition to
the feelings and mental processes that
go along with many of them.
I (so well) remember every one of them.
I do not take my mind back to them
(hardly at all anymore) -- because
each one has been fully processed --
and I am no longer feeling battered
by those experiences.
Okay.
In fact -- in every case -- the things
which I was required to "walk through"
-- were truly learning experiences --
and (as weird as it may sound) I am
glad that I had to go through each
one of them.
Frequently -- a great deal of wisdom
is only gained -- by going through
a number of baskets of pains and
distresses.
But -- I've brought this all up --
because -- as you share each incident
in your own life -- my head so often
speaks up -- reminding me that I have
"been there".
Not always exactly the very situation
that you are going through -- but
(sometimes) yes.  And at other times
(although some of the particulars are
different) -- still -- the emotional
struggles (and various other feelings)
are so very much alike.
Usually -- my greatest hope for you
is that you do not have to go through
the pains, frustrations, and distresses
which I went through -- to come out on
the other side.
Thanks.
And I think very strongly about what
I might share with you -- so that your
journey (in each situation) might be
less traumatic than I remember mine
to have been.
That's kind.
Now.  I believe all that I just said
-- may be of some value to you. 
       But I don't think any of that 
       (specifically) addresses the
       question that you had asked:
"So how did you think you knew that I would
find and employ a cure for my disability?"
Let me try to (really) get at that now.
     I have been arrested -- and done some jail time.
     I have been in mental wards -- 3 times.
     I have been homeless -- sometimes, extendedly.
None of these are a picnic!
I wish none of them on anyone.
Wow. Yeah. Agreed. I didn't know those things about you.
But -- I came through each one of them.
And -- I came through with a lot of
"learnin'" too.
Although we can get some help from others
-- as we are going through each of the
trials in our life -- the bottom line is
that the healing (only) (and always) comes
from within.
We have to reach down inside our own self
-- and go through the necessary exercises
-- to heal ourself.
And our healing does not begin until we
are "willing" to do some very difficult
stuff within that self.
Those who never get to that place of
"willingness" -- never find their
healing.
But most do.                      When it is their time.
          I did. 
                    And that is why I believe
                        that you (also) will.
Thank you.
 
[end of my answer to your question (for now)]
 
You're welcome.
Well, thanks for chatting tonight. Hope you have a good rest of your night and weekend. Let's tentatively plan on chatting again next Friday evening.
K9PMKuts
Sounds good to me -- Fri Oct 2 2020.
Thank you also for this evening.
I hope all goes well for you this week.
Thanks.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're welcome Son.
Good night.

After putting a bit more of my own time into refining your 29 PoL && 13 Axiomz, I decided they ought to be included in an Octology release for this 1st of October. Please check it out before tomorrow evening, if you can.
HTTPS://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology/blob/a4086019e0797015a485216e4185691007e7fc6a/dox/2du/know.ls#L688

P.S. You should try to re-write Octology `d8` in VisualBasic or whatever your preferred MicroSoft Windows language is for now. d8-stamps && dur8ions are vastly superior to your date-time stamping conventions, if you would just grok the many valid reasons.

I've added a couple pertinent links to a slightly upd8d version at: HTTPS://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology/blob/c8256a5efbb988824c4b4974f49f7eb0ef710b7b/dox/2du/know.ls#L688

Hello Dad.
5'10-02-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Shabbat Shalom Philip.
And how was your week ?
Shabbat Shalom to you too. My week has been a bit stressful, since I still haven't yet worked out how to get to stay in my current apartment or found another acceptable one to move to... and my clock is ticking. Otherwise though, my week has been pretty good. Thanks! How was your week?
Well -- all but that one (important) bit -- I'm glad to hear it.
üòä
üòä
What are those developments ?
What "developments" are you asking about?
The "roof" project.
The prevention of being rained on.
Ah. Yeah, I've been studying some of the Wisconsin Tenancy laws. I've been drafting a rough outline of different approaches to writing a letter to my landlord, Doug C., to hopefully persuade him to stop trying to kick me and Darjee out. We can't really afford to move anywhere else on short-notice.
Yep.   I understand.
About that "letter" -- I have one suggestion.
Should I share ?
Please suggest it to me. Yes!
Ok.
I will.
Make the letter totally sound like you are entirely willing to do anything he wants -- to be able to stay there.   I believe what I'm really saying is to let him know that you will bow down & eat humbly pie.
I think that is one of Dr. Pete's rules -- yes ?
üòä
For reference, the issues I've thought of bringing up are: Not even eviction notice served to me (as it was said to be), but this is just a routine Tenancy Termin8ion form. You provided 4 invalid reasons inside the "Description of Premises:" section. Maybe he's discrimin8ing illegally against me, a disabled man. etc..
/humbly/   /humble/
I'm not sure if "eating humble pie" is assoC8d with one of Dr. Peterson's 12-Rules-for-Life chapters yet. I've only ever been able to read just the first chapter of that. I need better prescription glasses, but haven't had new ones in past decade of poverty I've endured since coming to Wisconsin.
Thank you for your advice there. Maybe I'm more inclined to go in well-informed, with references to Statutes and sub-sections, shock-and-awe inspire in him maybe somewhat (once he realizes that he's essentially illiterate and going up against a word-smith? He wrote "Loud music all ours of day's". He put an apostrophe in: "Harassing tenant's" too. Bleh.
s/\?/\?)/;  # oops. I forgot to close my open-parenthesis before "once", so appending it after question-mark.
üòä
You oops is fore-given.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I know you think you do love me, but I'm not so certain. You may. I'm equivoc8ing on "love" in general l8ly.
Thank you for at least frequently indic8ing that you think you love me.
You're welcome.
And ...
It's ok.   You have the right to vote on it.
What?!
I have the "right" to "vote" on whether you love me? How does that work?
You have the right to vote (within yourself) on whether anything that any other person says -- is true -- or not.
If someone says that they love you -- but you do not feel loved by them -- you (fully) have a right to cast that "vote".
Maybe skip those questions. I was curious about voting procedures you might've had in mind. Now I think that it's more str8-forward to just stipul8 that I think you have to learn what "love" means to the being that you love, for you to be providing what they're wanting loving them to mean.
Go on please.
Ah. Thanks. I wasn't sure. Maybe the heart of the issue is attempting to love "unconditionally"? If there were just a few poignant conditions, I think it could work out much better all around.
I watched a TEDxTalk on YouTube earlier today, which purported to discuss how to love and be loved... but it was a real let-down because it insisted on it being "unconditional".
Well -- I guess all I can say is:
Michael Bolton - Love Is a Wonderful Thing
Michael Bolton - Love Is a Wonderful Thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_ezMbv2sr4
Love is not that big a deal. We can come back to it as a topic whenever.
Ok.
I can w8.
üòä
Yes.   I've found many Ted-Talks to leave me with one reaction:
Playing video now. 4m20s is the ultim8 time for smoking marijuana. I don't remember ever hearing this song before.
                 What ?!
I am quite fond of the "interro-bang" for punctu8ion too.  üòâ
"Love Is A Wonderful Thing" peaked at #4 on the day that Angie became a teenager.
Wow! It sure looks d8d.
That was Thursday, June 1, 1991.
Not really my type of song, or video. Quaint, I guess.
Information you can only get from your Daddy-Disk-Jockey.
üòä
So have you readd my block-comment sections from Line 688 onward in know.ls yet? What do you think of any of that?
Angie was also born on a Thursday --
at 0041 in the morning.
Yes -- I have.
I readd it again today.
But -- I say "again" -- because I have already readd all of that last week in your email to Angela Renee. 
It has been added to, somewhat further, but yeah much still remaining same. I don't think I've heard any of your thoughts about any of it since then though either. Did you laugh? Cry? Hurt?
Laugh -- no.
Cry -- no.
Hurt -- no.
Any other choices ?
You choose, please. Mine were merely suggestions of what could've been a positive reaction, somewhat.
Well.  Last week when you sent it to Angie
-- and "copied" it to 1 or 2 other friends
-- I was ok with that.  But today -- my
feeling was a bit different.
I would like to respectfully request that
you do not publicly publish the Pieces
of Light (or the Axioms) anywhere.
Ah. Okay.
Of course, I have no way of preventing
you from doing so -- and even if I did
-- I would not exert it.  It is just
my sincere request.
Thank you Pip.
I can check-in another change to remove those out. I'll do that shortly.
Did you want to tell me anything else about your past week now ?
I'm all ears.
Nothing I can think of right now. I was hoping my comments would engage with your material in various worthwhile ways. I also had hoped that my critiques of your material could gain some interest if I could share it somewhat... so I'm disappointed that you don't want my over-view on it to stand online. Can I please ask why you most don't want it on GitHub?
Sure.
The FTR company was established in the Summer of 2015 -- and had been in the serious development stage for about 3¬Ω years before that.   During that time -- as well as in the 5 years since then -- we have set down dozens of guidelines for how we wish to share all of our information -- and that includes the 100s (and hundreds) of Scripts -- as well as The Pieces of Light & The Axioms et cetera.   ¬∂   So -- it really is nothing against GitHub -- it is simply that one of our FTR guidelines is that we "mass" publish nothing.   This also means that we sell nothing to our students either.   In fact -- this may actually set us apart from every other "Personal Development" organization on the planet -- who sell books, and audio tapes, and even videos of their seminars -- to their students.   ¬∂   The truth is -- the FTR company sells nothing.   But we do rent one thing:
                                                           a chair -- for about 4¬Ω hours.
Thank you for asking.
Hmm. So my critique of your material shouldn't be considered "fair-use" or something like that?
If your "we" is supposed to include me, I'd like to point out that I don't know dozens of guidelines for info sharing, or other materials.
If you wish to critique any of our material to friends -- one on one -- here and there -- and with whomever you please -- -- of course -- do that.
Just don't "mass" produce it.
Why does "mass" production bother you?
This is the very same thing that we tell our students.
Share what you have learned here with anyone.
But do it one-on-one.
I'm not aware of us having any students (much less what same things we "tell" them).
When I give a Seminar -- there are students.
The last one I gave had 28 or 29.
Okay. I didn't know that.
It's alright.
My filing cabinets -- and Tera -- are full of all of this 8¬Ω years of stuff.
Over the next 8¬Ω years -- if you are interested -- you will become privy to much of it.
With my purpose being to challenge all the cohesive material I could from your 29 PoL and 27 Axioms, why is just as public on GitHub.Com as it already was on ILoveThis.Org becoming a "mass" production problem?
The FTR company owns ilovethis.org.
And the 29 Pieces were posted there before the company was incorporated in 2015.
Possibly (after the Seminars get really rolling) we shall remove them from ilovethis.org.
We'll see.
Why would you want to do that?
Do what ?
Remove them ?
Remove them why?
Oh.
Ok.
Because we want to address our students face-to-face -- and allow them to ask questions directly at us.   And we want us all gathered together (in a small group) in a common room -- for about 4 or 5 hours.
Good question Pip.
I still don't see any point to taking them off-line. Why would you want to do that, at all, ever?
We didn't remove them yesterday.   If you wish to ask your "ever" question again tomorrow -- you certainly may.
üòä
By the way -- you are the only person in the world -- that I have ever told that The 29 Pieces are on ilovethis.org.
How does "29-Pieces-of-Light" and "27-Axioms" being online inhibit face-to-face direct questioning during a Seminar?
And -- that website gets less than a-half-a-dozen visitors per month.
And we're fine with that.
So you have no defense for any of your challenged Pieces or Axioms either?
That website was actually created for a specific purpose in 2010 -- and its purpose is essentially over.
You mean for the challenges that you shared with Angie ?
Seems crazy... to not even attempt to withstand any concerted contention with any of it. Oh well. I tried. I'll remove them from GitHub soon. Please let me know if you ever change your mind, and will allow me to include my extensive detailed commentary around your original material back in my Octology know.ls file. I think they belong there.
No -- I have no defenses.
Yeah. I challenged almost all of it. Every piece I could gain any grip on within my fixed-width constraints.
Share your feelings about them one-on-one with your friends.
That is a very good idea.
Our students do not like many of the Pieces either.
And they discuss them with their friends too.
This is good.
I don't have any friends to share them one-on-one with, at the moment. Maybe I will find some suitable friends again, someday.
You will.
And you have a few there in Wisconsin too.
A few have even been to your apartment.
Hardly anyone here is liter8.
lol
Danny & John will be with you soon.
I'm not kidding. Tons of people around me can barely rEad or write.
And for today -- that is perfect.
Pc #29.
Hmm. Will Danny && John be with me soon? I wish they would. Why might you think they will?
Ask me that again on October 23rd -- will you please.
?
If I remember then, I'll try to.
Good.
Thank you Pip.
You had asked me how my week went.
Are you ready for that now ?
Yes.
Ok.
Thank you for asking about my week.
Report follows.
This past week was an Xceptional Week -- on all fronts!
I have been eating as Josh for the last 8
days -- and have lost 5¬Ω pounds during them.              
I'm happy with you (and me).  Thank you Philip.
 
Also -- my movie-watching has attenuated to
an Xtremely moderate level in this past week.
And I am a happy camper about that too.
Gr8! Glad to hear all that.
 
üòä
 
Additionally -- I am glad to report that
we have written 45 hours of FTR Scripts
-- in a mere 6 days.
Yes.  It has been a very good week for me.
(//)
(//)
Did you even rEad and understand any of my comments? Why can't your material be scrutinized and defended?
2 good questions.
I'll start with the first one.
It has 2 parts to it.
Did I read any of your comments ?
The answer is:  no -- I did not read any of them.
I readd all of them.
Now.
2nd part of question #1:
Did I understand any of your comments ?
I believe I understood most of your comments --
even though I do not (personally) stand under them.
Shall I proceed on to Q#2 -- or ?
Sure.
Ok.
Thank you.
You asked:
"Why can't your material be scrutinized and defended ?"
Again -- there are 2 parts to this one.
It can (certainly) be scrutinized.
Which you did.  
And we always want our students to do this -- with everything that we share with them.
Now -- on the "defended" part:
I don't believe you. If this were the case, you would contend with the challenges, and reinforce the stability of the material through refinement and intellectual linguistic expressive jousting of sorts.
Ah yes.
So you would think.
So I *do* think. Yeah.
But I am not doing that --
yet.
I'm am still chewing on your comments.
Puedo ?
Fair enough.
Yeah. Sure. They took time to write, even if most were rel8ively easy to come up with in close to original forms. Take time to absorb too...
You bring up some very valid issues Pip.
And -- maybe while I am chewing --
Sweet! Which issue seemed most valid to you, and why?
possibly you could too.
Well -- off the top of my head --
I vividly remember your comment to Ax#8.
I loved what you said there.
I can try to re-chew my own dog-food so-to-speak, and maybe want to revise my contribution to what could be seen as a discoursive turn-based oppositional dialectic we could collabor8 on, but then I'd want to post my upd8s to GitHub again, so we could see them aligned and in-lined with each other amidst meticulous formatting && staunch unity of message in blocked ranges.
In a number of them -- I noticed that you have quite a problem with when I make statements containing "absolute" adjectives and/or adverbs.   ¬∂   But (of course) this is nothing new to me.   You've been impressing that on me for many moons!
üòä
Talk to me Pip.
Yes! You're noticing, I *do* sense gr8 trouble when "absolute" stuff is brought into play without caveats excepted && such.
I thought you said you were going to take them down from GitHub.
I did. They're in the repository history (somewhat irreversibly), but are no longer in my head development branch.
Fine.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks Dad. Maybe someday you can send me a calendar or something having to do with stuff I like, value, am awed by, etc. instead of Kauai year-after-year, when I've never been there and have essentially no Hawai'i experience to build on with any of that. Then we'd probably be getting close to a conditional rather mutual, more reciprocal, rel8ionship that I would think could grow toward love, as I see it.
Good point Pip.
Sending you a calendar with photographs of stuff that you like -- sounds like a grreat idea to me.
How about giving me some suggestions ?
Okay...
Sk8 && Snow-boarding, Black Yamaha Crotch-Rocket Sport-Bike MotorCycles, Blue Tesla Cars, anything ElonMusk or JonathanBlow or maybe EricWeinstein, && LindseyStirling SleepWalking especially! Thanks for showing interest.  üòä
You're welcome.
I'm always interested in you.
I just chuckled about you noting that ILoveThis.Org only gets a half-dozen or so hits each period, but like yeah Octology is probably getting hit even less still.
In case you haven't seen this, I totally love it and her in almost every way: HTTPS://YouTu.be/jyvcg72-reA  Yay! Go L.S.!  üòä
I'm having some trouble loading it.
BBS
It looks like the link-detection might've gotten messed-up. You may just have to drag-copy the URL text then paste-and-go.
Yes -- I did that -- but still won't load.   Hold tight.   I haven't given up yet.
Just search "Lindsey Stirling SleepWalking".
Yep.   Thank you.   That got it.   4:06 or 3:51 ?
4:06
Good.   Thank you.
Got it.
Be back in about 4¬Ω.
Yes.    I loved it.   Thank you so much.
She's the gr8St!  üòä
Yes.   Lindsey is a good dancer --
         but --
she has never had a violin lesson in her life.
üòä
I enjoyed it.
Thank you.
Glad you did. You're welcome.
Watching it again
This music video epitomizes nearly absolute beauty as far as I'm concerned, which is to say "A lot!"  üòâ
Duly noted.
Thank you.
I have the video downloaded onto my hard-drives, so that even if my Internet connection goes down, I hopefully will still be able to see && hear L.S. gr8!
That's good.
This week -- as I was reviewing our chats from
last weekend -- I thought of some other things
I might share with you.  Would you like that now ?
Yes, please.
Ok.   Here 'tis.
 
          On Friday evening, September 25th, 2020
          -- I shared with you:
 
  ‚Ä¢  I have been arrested -- and done some jail time.
  ‚Ä¢  I have been in mental wards -- 3 times.
  ‚Ä¢  I have been homeless -- sometimes, extendedly.
 
          What I could possibly have added was:
 
  ‚Ä¢  I had tenant complaints -- about my loud music.
  ‚Ä¢  I was evicted from my apartment, the favorite of my life!
  ‚Ä¢  I lost all of my belongings -- except what I was wearing.
 
This (of course) included ‚Ä¢ all of my furniture (some
dating back to 1964) ‚Ä¢ my computer system ‚Ä¢ my entire
wardrobe ‚Ä¢ all pictures and various other memorabilia
from childhood up (49 years worth)
That totally sucks, man!  üòû
                                                           -- including all my
photographs from ‚Ä¢ my school days ‚Ä¢ summer camps, and
‚Ä¢ college, and ‚Ä¢ my summers spent in ‚Ä¢ Minot, Mass,
as a young child, and ‚Ä¢ my visits to see Uncle Thurman
and his family in ‚Ä¢ Weymouth, Massachusetts ‚Ä¢ Wilmington,
North Carolina, and ‚Ä¢ Grand Forks, North Dakota -- and
 
(with your Mom): ‚Ä¢ our wedding ‚Ä¢ our honeymoon in San
Diego, our trip to ‚Ä¢ Las Vegas (to see Elvis in person),
and our trips to ‚Ä¢ San Luis Obispo ‚Ä¢ Hearst Castle
‚Ä¢ Carmel & Monterey ‚Ä¢ San Francisco ‚Ä¢ the Grand Canyon
in Arizona ‚Ä¢ The Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs
‚Ä¢ Ogallala, Nebraska, to drop off Pete Moss at his first
professional radio job (all 3 of those occurring in the
mid-March of 1972) ‚Ä¢ Ventura, California, to visit Mom's
Mother (with you and Angie in 1978), and a sweet visit
to ‚Ä¢ Virginia's Old Williamsburg, in May of 1980 (while
Mom was pregnant with Tim), plus an unforgetable weekend
in ‚Ä¢ Boston (before you came along) -- in addition to
‚Ä¢ many Los Angeles Kings hockey games (in 1971 & '72)
before we moved to ‚Ä¢ Allentown PA (for my first radio
job after college & our marriage) -- and soon after,
our visits to the ‚Ä¢ waterbed factories in ‚Ä¢ Findlay,
Ohio, and ‚Ä¢ Hartford, Connecticut, and ‚Ä¢ various
waterbed stores up and down the eastern seaboard,
including ‚Ä¢ Baltimore, Maryland, and on the west coast,
especially in ‚Ä¢ Hollywood & Bakersfield -- and then,
in 1981 -- all 5 of us visited "Graceland", in ‚Ä¢ Memphis
-- where Elvis had lived from 1957 to 1977.  Of course
 
(without Dot) I had also taken a few thousand snapshots
during my journeyings to ‚Ä¢ Viet Nam ‚Ä¢ Hong Kong ‚Ä¢ New
Orleans ‚Ä¢ Atlanta ‚Ä¢ Chicago, and ‚Ä¢ Los Angeles, and at
‚Ä¢ the 1986 Expo in ‚Ä¢ Vancouver, Canada ‚Ä¢ Niagara Falls
(1959) ‚Ä¢ Washington DC (1961), and (in 1999) ‚Ä¢ the Blue
Ridge Parkway in Virginia.
¬∑ 
                                                     ‚Ä¢ all of my books
(nearly 2000) including all of my college textbooks
‚Ä¢ all of my music & movies ‚Ä¢ all of my kitchen stuff
and various other appliances ‚Ä¢ my radios & other
entertainment devices (TV, CD player, etc.) ‚Ä¢ all of
my files from many decades -- some loose in boxes --
some in 3-ring binders -- and more than 112,000 pages
in 5 filing cabinets -- nearly 8000 of which were
"Fix The Radio" Scripts.  And (on top of all that)
I lost ‚Ä¢ the best car I ever owned: the beautiful
white 1973 MGB -- with my (personally) customized
dashboard.
 
Was God sleeping -- when all of this was going on ?
 
I say no.  Everything is perfect.  It just takes
me a few months (or decades) to recognize
"the big picture" -- and then I see the perfection.
Aww. Yeah, what did your Father have to say about any of this?
  
(//)
Hmm. I don't think I could be appeased so readily.
He said 3 things.
 
Everything has a purpose.
 
All in good time.
 
And soon you will (too) know
-- even as you are now known.
And did you too know soon thereafter?
Depends.
Frequently -- My Father's "soon" does not come quite as swiftly -- as I had wished that it would.
But -- even that too -- in the fullness of time -- I see the very wisdom of "The Wait".
Why does He use "soon" when it wouldn't be considered that way for you?
There are only 2 things that Our Father want from us.
And the 2nd one -- is for us to "be Him".
And that means that He must put us through the necessary exercises -- for us to learn ‚Ä¢ how He thinks ‚Ä¢ how he sees ‚Ä¢ how He feels ‚Ä¢ how He plans ‚Ä¢ how He brings each of those plans to fruition ‚Ä¢ and (nearly) countless other things about "the being of Him" -- which all take a lot of time.   Furthermore -- so many things about Him -- are so un-like what we know of the "ways of the world" -- that we struggle greatly with many of things which He is (so patiently) trying to teach us.   But He hangs on in there -- as long as we do.   And when we are not willing to hang -- He always can wait until we return -- to all of the lessons that we have to wrap our head around -- in order to (finally) -- 
                             Be Him.
/many of things/         /many of the things/
/Father want from/      /Father wants from/
If I have upbraided && evicer8d the overwhelming majority of your "Pieces-of-Light" and "Axioms", why then do you relax as though they can still "hold-water" while they're pocked full of holes? How can you have no imper8ive to examine them, revise them, improve them? Aren't some of my form-fitting answers pretty sound responses to what you were trying to get at?
Maybe.
I'm still chewing.
Ah. I'm just imp8ient about it then. I'll try to relax about it more too. I thought my comment8ion transformed your fragile scaffolding of mostly dispar8 concepts into a magnificent diatribe on wisdom aligned and unified into conformance && cohesion with their found contexts. I believe I could have provided more than plenty to chew on.
You did.
Good job Pip.
Thank you.
Yes sir ?
You wanted to say something ?
You're welcome. I tried to make my mark gr8. Sorry if I got too harsh && dismissive of you to Angie. I'm not sure how to balance somewhat wild like && scorn for all my old rel8ives && friends l8ly.
You are right on schedule Pip.
I am proud of you.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Nice.  üòä
Yes.   üòä
I sense -- by the fact that we have only been chatting during 53 of the last 55 minutes -- that we are (possibly) about finished -- for this session.   Do you concur with that -- or ?
Yes. It would probably be good for us to wrap up our chat for tonight somewhat soon... unless you have more you'd like to get into before we sign-off?
Actually -- I don't.
Well then -- thank you for this evening.
Are we on for the 9th ?
You're welcome. Thank you too. Yes, let's plan again on Oct. 9th @ 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime.
Good.
Thank you.
And -- may I say again -- that:

I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Have a good night -- and a grreat next week.

Hello Dad.
6'10-10-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
Good Evening.
And how was your week ?
It went pretty well, thanks. How was yours?
A second excellent on in a row !!
Thank you for asking.
     ... and especially ...
Thank you for sending it to me.
üòä
üòä
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks Dad.
You're so very welcome.
So.     Details about your week ?
Your roofing project -- and whatever else ?
The main thing I did was write Doug a letter asking to let me stay, yeah.
Good for you.
I'm proud of you.
            [ applause goes here ]
His response ?
None yet.
Ok.
When sent to him ?
Finished writing Wednesday, then delivered on Thursday, Oct. 8th.
Good.
And how is your breathing ?
Fine.
Xcellent.
I'm glad.
You are my perfect son.
üòä
You are my dad. How has your breathing been?
              One-durfull.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
15 days in a row now -- Eating As Josh.
That's gr8!  üòä
About 30+ hours done on FTR stuff this past week.
And moderate YT-movie watching all this week too.
I've been behaving myself.
Good.
And thank you for your applause.
üòä
So -- what else about your week ?
1 letter out -- and got a little sleep.
Not much else I can think of, right now.
Yeah.
Ok.
Thank you.
The perpetuation of your roofery was the important one.
I'm glad about that.
Good job Pip.
Thanks.
üòä
wLcome.
Well there's nothing on my P.C.A. for tonight. Yours?
lol
Ok.
I have one.
Very low importantata though.
Okay.
Shall I ship it ?
Yes.
Ok.
Let me go get it.
Ah yes.   Here it is.
 
                       The Big-Shopping Report
 
Although this is not a very important subject to be sharing
with you -- I am doing so for essentially 2 reasons. 
One is: because you have shared with me where YOU shop. 
So I figured that a reciprocation was appropriate. 
And the other one is:  you (pretty standardly) ask me about
how my week was -- and this was (very) a part of my past week.
 
¬∂
 
I generally go "Big Shopping" -- about once every 3 or 4 weeks.
I define "Big Shopping" as: going out to Wyomissing -- to shop
at my 3 fave stores -- which are:
 
    ‚Ä¢  Walmart  -  major department store
    ‚Ä¢  Staples   -  major stationery    store
    ‚Ä¢  Redner's -  major grocery       store
 
Redner's is only one of 3 major grocery choices in the Reading
area.  But it is deffy my favorite.  Most major grocery outlets
have between 12 and 20 (long) aisles of shelvings to pick from
-- and Redner's is right in that ballpark.  Plus good lighting,
great prices, and super people.
As major department stores go -- I'm not sure that Walmart is
necessarily better than Target -- which I DO patronize (maybe)
2 or 3 times per year -- but -- because I'm a bus-rider --
rather than a car-driver -- the Walmart makes more sense --
as it is in the same shopping center with Staples and Redner's.
 
¬∂
 
And then -- betwixt those "major" shopping excursions --
I do "Little Shopping" in dribs & drabs -- usually about
once a week (or so) -- at 3 local stores -- which are:
  
  ‚Ä¢  Santa Barbara  -  actually a sandwich shop (where I get
                                  tuna hoagies occasionally) -- but they
                                  also have 2 short aisles of groceries 
                                  -- which I rarely buy -- because their
                                  prices are kinda high -- as is the norm
                                  for local "corner" stores.
 
  ‚Ä¢  Family Dollar  -  a mini department store -- with about 
                                4 aisles of groceries too -- and fairly
                                reasonable prices.
 
  ‚Ä¢  Jimmy's C-Town -  a medium-sized grocery store -- with
                                    about 8 aisles of grocery shelves -- 
                                    and (acceptable) mid-range prices
                                    -- not as low as Redner's -- but
                                    (certainly) much more palatable
                                    than at the Santa Barbara.
 
Right on.
 
However.  Whenever I shop at any one of these 3 -- I do not
combine it with any of the other 2.  This is because of the
weight of the packages -- which I need to be carrying back
to my homestead. 
        Especially from C-Town -- where a heavy load
        makes every step -- a painful experience.
                    And -- I ain't no spring chicken any more!
Santa Barbara     -  1    block    -  264 steps
Family Dollar       -  2    blocks  -  528 steps
Jimmy's C-Town  -  3¬Ω blocks  -  924 steps
 
¬∂
 
I used to walk out to the Walmart/Staples/Redner's shopping
center (and bus back, of course) -- but I haven't been doing
that recently -- over the past couple of years or so. 
       Not sure exactly why.    But I just haven't.
That Wyomissing Shopping Center = 3.4 miles = 8976 steps = 68 minutes
The bus ride  (a much fewer calorie-burner for your Dad)       = 30 minutes
 
¬∂
 
However.  All of the above was just (really) a preface to the
story (about this past Tuesday) which I had (initially) wanted
to share with you.
 
¬∂
 
As I had said:
I generally go "Big Shopping" -- about once every 3 or 4 weeks.
But this was only up until the "social distancing" order --
which came from The White House on Monday, March 16, 2020
-- and the public buildings in Berks County put up their
"No Mask No Entry" signs in the 3rd week of April 2020.
I purchased mine at 1613 on Thursday, April 23rd of 2020.
It was at that time that I decided that I was going to
limit my bus-riding to "extremely rarely" -- and do the
bulk of my necessary shopping at only "walk to" stores.
At that time -- my most recent "Big-Shopping" trip was
43 days earlier -- on Wednesday, March 11th, of 2020.
And -- I figured that all of my non-foody items
(mostly my many stationery-store things) would
probably hold me for another month (or so).
And (actually) they did -- for another 51 days
-- until Saturday, June 13, 2020 -- which was
a total of 94 days -- and (also) would happen
to be my grandfather's 123rd birthday.
On my "March"     Wyo trip -- I picked up 34 items.
On my "June"       Wyo trip -- I picked up 30 items.
On my "October"  Wyo trip -- I picked up 51 items.
                                              and ordered  1 more.
Why so many ?    2 reasons (primarily):
 
#1  -  it had been 115 days since my "June" trip!
#2  -  I was real low on "paper" stuff, id est:
         notepads, envelopes, file folders, and
         (of course) "sticky-notes".
So.  On this past Tuesday, October 6th, 2020
-- from 0719 to 1244 -- I ventured off to
Wyomissing (on the bus) to end up with
(what I expected to be) "a major haul".
            And truly -- it was !!
I realized (also) that: although the "walk"
home -- from the bus stop to my apartment
-- was only 1 block (264 steps) -- they
were (certainly) NOT going to be easy ones.
Those 51 items would (possibly) weigh an
average of about 1 pound each.  So.  I had
a plan.  I would take some "helper" items
along with me.
 
    (A)   my blue backpack
    (B)   a (soft) suitcase
    (C)   my "mighty handle" -- a truly beautiful
            device -- for the carrying of multiple
            plastic bags -- without the severing
            of one's fingers
 
 
And -- it's a good thing that I did. 
I NEVER would have made it home without them !!!
Carrying "helper" items is often a very good idea.
 
       The total load was 54.6 pounds!
           And no -- I don't think I EVER
           want to try to do that again.
                              Whew !!
üòä

[ end of shopping report ]
Thank you for listening.
Cool. You're welcome. Well I'm getting rather drowsy, so shall we please try to chat again Friday evening?
Let'
whoops
Let's.
Sounds good. I hope you have a good week ahead.
Fri Oct 19 2020 ?
You too -- have a great week.
Thank you for tonight.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
No  --  Fri Oct 16 2020.
Yeah.
Good.
And good night Son.
Good Night Dad.

KAGMIxED
Hi Dad.
5'10-16-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
Yeah, good evening to you too.  üòä
And how was your week ?
üòä
Pretty good, thanks. How was yours?
I'm not sure yet.
Do you plan to keep your roof ?
Still haven't heard back from Doug yet. He's terribly unprofessional. I'm not sure if anything is going to happen on Monday.
Hmm.
And how is your breathing ?
Fine. Hurt my back a little yesterday, picking up cat-food and litter, but it seems to be slowly getting better and isn't too troublesome.
Good.
What "pound" bags do you usually get ?
Usually 3 something but yesterday got a deal on a 13-pound bag.
Ah so.
That'll do it !!
Plus like 20-pound litter.
lol
Yep.
I know the program.
Sorry about the "story" last week.
You thought if your "ancient" Dad could come home from his shopping with 54 pounds -- his "young" son could do likewise.
Yeah.  üòä
The secret is to lift with legs -- not with back (by bending over).
But it's ok.
You will heal.
Yep.
Or -- you will call on Angie.
How is Darjee doing ?
She's good. She was just on my lap before I went to get more iced tea and some bread to make peanut-butter sandwiches. Now she's playing with a toy out in the living room.  üòä
Xcellent.
I'm glad you have her.
Me too!
üòä
Pour me a glass of that iced tea too please.
Okay. It's white peach and apricot. Yummy!
Organic black tea.
I love it.
Thank you.
I'm actually just drinking from the bottle.
Macho man.
üòä
No glasses needed.
Is that a wide-mouth (2") bottle ?
I don't cotton to drinking from those.
Probably.
S'ok.
Whatever floats your boat.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks Dad. I try to ‚ù§
you too.
Nope.
I get love from you -- so you (must be) doing better than "trying" !!
Nice.
Yes you are Pip.
Not always. I can be quite harsh much of the time.
Sometimes exacting.
Exacting is good -- imo.
Why are you harsh ?
That's not the you that I know so well.
Because I can often think and say (or write) what I really feel, rather than what would be nice to hear (or read).
My commentary on your 27 and 29 can be a good example.
And why do you do that ?
It's more honest.
Is honest (with others) more important than kind ?
Sometimes.
Usually, for me.
And why is that for you ?
Because I care about honesty and truth vastly more than merely what would just be nice.
Unpleasant-truth is my middle-name.  üòâ
Within the self -- that is very important.
And with your Dad -- it is fully ok.
But -- for most people -- stark honesty -- turns them off from you.
Indeed.
Is this what you want ?
Not always. It can turn out to become pretty harsh for me, in other ways.
Go on please.
Not sure how to right now. Maybe ask another more probing question please?
Well -- ok.
You said:
       "Not always."
Are there some times when you want people to turn away from you ?
Ah. Okay. If I tell people how idiotic they are, they don't respond well.
Yeah. Idiots should turn away from me.
Let's let idiots to themselves.
Sometimes they're like doctors or something though. They can force bull-shit on me sometimes.
We'll get back to the doctors a little later.
Let's talk about some people who you would like in your "circle".
Okay ?
Okay.
Good.
Anyone who's at least sometimes rather smart, I'd probably like to have in my "circle" somehow, somewhat.
There are a number of family members who would rather not be "in your circle".
Yes.
Angie and Tim, mainly.
Shall I pick one -- or -- would you like to pick one ?
Ok.
Good.
Let's start with Ange -- yes ?
Okay.
Good.
Do you know why Angie tends to avoid you ?
Something you did -- or something you said ?
Probably because I have continued to use amphetamines, and she thinks she never can do so again... that doing so is probably evil somehow or something.
Is she clean ?
Assumed to be exclusively self-destructive.
Yeah, as far as I know she steers totally clear of amphetamines, and must, for her own depression and sanity.
Is she (also) resolute in that ?
I think so.
I don't know.
We've barely talked in the 5 years since she moved to Columbia.
Ok.
I'll accept your "think so" as if it be so.
Now.
Maybe it'd be better: "I guess so."
"I guess so" is still ok.
Let's go from that assumption.
If -- she is clean -- and resolute -- in staying that way -- she also knows that simply having conversation with someone that is not -- will not damage her sobriety.
Do you agree with that statement ?
Probably. Maybe she thinks I'm something like a "lost-cause", possibly inherited from our moms.
Explain that last part please.
Moms seem to think I'm simply a hopeless Methamphetamine addict. Angie may think this too, because of their attitudes and opinions.
I see.
Thank you.
I don't believe it.
Me either.
I'm a user. Not an addict.
What do YOU believe ?
I think Angie has another reason for shunning contact with you.
What might that be?
What do you think about that ?
Yes.
Could be a surprise to me.
Good question.
Shoot for it please.
I don't even know what to guess yet.
Does your "using" hurt Angie ?
Seeing me out of California is sad somehow, for my sake?
Maybe it hurts her somehow. I don't know.
Enough not to speak to you ?
If she knew I used every week or two, yeah it might hurt her.
Maybe. I don't know.
Maybe she worries about Darj more than me.
Sadness over the lifestyle of someone you love -- is not !! -- a reason not to talk to them.
If anything -- it is a reason to love them even more -- id est -- talk with them frequently.
Hmm. Maybe.
A lot of people are convinced that amphetamines make people lie, cheat, and steal. Not me though.
So -- I say that Angie loves you.
Do you give a "yes" to that ?
No.
I doubt she loves me at all anymore. Not sure why.
Good.
Something quenched her (actively) loving you.
Yes ?
Maybe.
I'll take that as a tentative "yes".
Now what do you think that was ?
No idea.
The thing that "shut her off" from you.
Did you do something to her ?
That turned her off ?
Used amphetamines, sort of?
Nope.
That seems to be the last issue we had when they moved away.
I'm not buying that.
I know Angie.
That wasn't it.
Did you do something to her -- other than using amph ?
Not that I can remember.
Yes.
I (fully) think that you are correct.
I'm trying to turn on my camera, in case you'd like to see and hear me somewhat again tonight. You may need to answer.
Shall I try to hang-up and video-call again?
Gerry missed a call from you
Oct 16, 8:00 PM
Ah well. Seems to not be working.
So.  If a person wants nothing to do with you -- but -- you did not do something to them to cause it -- what is some other possibility for them to have responded in that way ?
Maybe they've just gotten too busy or something?
You know that is not the case with Ange.
Try another one please.
Don't know.
You know that I have something in mind -- don't you ?
Yeah. No idea what it might be.
ok.
Gerry missed a call from you
Oct 16, 8:06 PM
There are 2 (customary) reasons why people sever friendships.
Something "done" is one of them.
And the other ?
Uhh... something "not done"?
lol
ok
I give up.
I'll tell you the other one.
Something "done" is one of them.  
Something "said" is the other one.
Angie avoids contact with you -- for #2.
I think of "said" as being "done" though. That's why I didn't guess that.
That's ok.
Sorry.
I was seeing 2.   You were seeing only 1.
So.
Let's get at the "said" issue.
Can we ?
Okay. I can't think of anything I said to Ange before she left that might make her no longer want any contact with me.
I can't either.
Shall we move on to Tim now ?
Okay.
Good.
What have you said to Tim -- that might have made him want no contact with you ?
Nothing that I know of.
Good.
Mom hext.
Mom next.
She's a witch.
Dan ?
Ginny ?
Uncle Alex ?
Don't know what I might've said or done to them.
Uncle Tony ?
Uncle Al is deceased.
Cancer.
Oh.
Tony, don't know.
I did not know that.
Thank you.
Uncle Bruce ?
Aunt Nina ?
None of them.
You believe that Mom is influencing all of them to have no contact with you ?
Yes.
And all because of your use of amph ?
Primarily.
Ok.
What is the secondary ?
That I'm "crazy" maybe?
Are you crazy ?
Somewhat.
You seem pretty lucid to me.
Don't you seem so to you ?
Sometimes people are too lucid.
Ok.
Are you crazy ?
Right now ?
Maybe slightly.
Go on.
I'll need to be convinced.
I'm always kinda crazy, by being willing to entertain "hair-brained" ideas and notions, I guess.
So was Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Wilbur & Orville, Alexander Bell, Albert E.
Right.
This does not make Ange, Tim, Mom, Rosie, and tons others avoid you.
It might.
Nope.
I've never met Rosie.
You don't need to.
She's a dolt.
An ex-nun. Pretty worthless.
But I know quite a bit about her.
Not much to say about her.
Yes -- she is a doll.
Dolt! Dumb-ass. Dense. Lame.
But I do know Mom, and Angie, and Tim, and Uncle Tony, et cetera.
Doll.  Wonderful person.
lol
She's wonder-less.
I know how you can get back to Ange and Tim and Mandy and your nieces and nephews.
Do you?
Yes.
How? I might not be willing to do what's needed... but I probably would try whatever could work.
There are a number of steps involved.
They are... ?
Are you at peace ?
Not so much.
Good.
Do you want to be ?
Not necessarily.
Why not ?
I may win the war, even if the battles somehow never end.
Are you and I at war ?
Maybe somewhat.
Probably mostly intellectually, cognitively.
I didn't know that.
Thank you.
I think there are constant wars between ideas.
You think Pieces of Light and Axioms are wisdom of some divine nature. I doubt this.
There's no war that I see there.
You have your beliefs.
I have mine.
I think there are ideas which war with each other.
I love spending time with you.
For mind-share, for action.
I don't care that we have different beliefs.
Do you wish that I would believe everything that you believe ?
No.
So -- I see no war.
Just maybe that you would shed belief in a "Father" God, if none exists, or if it is fundamentally evil and your belief strengthens it.
I acknowledge that there is no God -- in your belief system.
And I have no problem with that.
It does not affect (or -- in any way threaten) the God in my life.
I respect your beliefs.
Are you sure my belief system in no way threatens or affects the God in your life?
How could it ?
By challenging it.
You and I chat.
And -- I love your challenging of my beliefs.
I ‚ù§
 it !!
If our chatting includes reasons for you to potentially shed or diminish belief in a God, I think it's affecting it... and threatening it somewhat too.
And it is part of why I love you so much too.
Wow! Thanks Dad. I'm guessing I ‚ù§
you too.
You certainly do.
       Thank you Pip.
Okay. I ‚ù§
you.  üòä
If losing my wife did not quench my belief in God -- I'm sure -- nothing else in this world could ever even shake it --
a little bit !!!
üòä
Yes you do.
I recommend beliefs be "shake-able", especially if they're somehow groundless.
I agree.
And --
you certainly share yours with me.
And I also continue to share mine with you.
I enjoy it.
Yes. Me too.
I enjoy you.
Good.
üòä
And I shall not follow the examples of some of our other family members.
You are stuck with me.
I am glued to you.
And vice versa.
üòä
Yeah! Yay!  üòä
lol
Ditto.
So were you thinking I must have "said" something that turned all that family off from me?
Yepper.
Hmm.
I think I only have about 5 minutes left available to chat tonight, but can we please plan to reconvene on these and other topics tomorrow night again at our usual time?
We can.
Cool!
Rather curiously, no Mental Health Technician seems to have come tonight to observe me taking my required medic8ion. I wonder why. Rare that they don't show up close to 6PM my time.
I gave her the night off.
I said I would watch you.
Is that ok ?
Nice. Please feel free to do that whenever you'd like.  üòâ
Thank you.
I will.
I'm probably better off with far less (if any) of their anti-psychotic medic8ions.
The day is coming --
when you will no longer need ANY watching.
I look forward to that too.
Dr. Z is not so sure about that -- but I told him anyway.
üòä
Do you ?
I look forward to needing to be watched for newer, better reasons.  üòâ
You are the creator of you.
Not entirely.
You will make it happen.
We'll see.
You can carve that in stone.
L.O.L.
Can I break two tablets of stone each morning?
It's kind of a riddle joke I have.
Moshe smashing the tablets is endlessly hilarious to me.
40-days and 40-nights trying to carve crap by some burning bush or whatever is just funny to imagine smashing l8r out of indign8ion or something.
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
Can we please look forward to chatting more tomorrow night, around KAHMJ (Sat. Oct. 17th 7PM -0500 2020 Ptime)?
Yepper.
Thank you for tonight Pip.
That is gr8!  üòä
Hah!
Good one.
Look for you Sat Oct 17 2020 - 2000 G / 1900 P ?
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Yes. Thank you very much for a very enjoyable and productive evening of chatting tonight.
You're gr8 Dad.
You're gr8 Pip.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Have a grreat evening.
You too.
Thank you.
I will if you will.

KAHMIson  (Sat. Oct. 17th 18:54:50:23 -0500 2020)
Hello Dad.
While yesterday's chat was interesting (and I hope we can return to some of the topics touched on eventually), I'm primarily concerned with just the serious possibility that my LandLord (Doug C. for "Carder"?) is going to try to unjustly evict me and Darjeeling by force on Monday, or shortly thereafter.
6'10-17-20 - 1958 Gtime / 1858 Ptime
Is there any way we could please focus primarily on what I am planning to do and ways that you might be able to tangibly help keep us in place, at least until we've found another place to move to?
Good Evening Philip.
Rather Poor Evening on my end here, Dad. Thanks for trying though.
Yes.  Your suggested focus for tonight is what I would like to discuss also.
You're welcome.
Thanks!
üòä
Shall I paste to you the text of what I've already hand-written and plan to tape to the outside of my door tomorrow evening?
Yes.
Let's see it please.
Let me do that, then please read it and tell me your thoughts afterward. Here it comes...
                                       Monday, October 19th, 2020                      
1. On Tue. Sep. 22nd of 2020, LandLord Doug C. served me a 28-Day Notice, indicating I must vacate these premises by today, Mon. Oct. 19th.
   He crucially mis-counted though. Today will have only been 27 Days, *not* 28 yet. From a Tuesday until a Monday cannot be 28 whole Days.
2. Doug C. and I have already signed another Year lease that is scheduled to conclude at the end of August, on the 31st of next Year, 2021.
   According to Docs.Legis.Wisconsin.Gov Statute Annotated ¬ß 704.19 (2)(b)(1), he should only be able to terminate my tenancy on that date.
3. Regarding section (2)(b)(2), there remains no evidence that I pose an imminent threat to him or anyone else. Neither have I received any
    criminal charges (drug-related or otherwise). My payee has always paid my entire rent on-time. I also remain uninformed about purported
    breaches of tenancy conditions (which I should be given at least 5-Days of fair opportunity to correct, once any have been made known).
I have left Doug C. voice-mails and written detailed letters, which have never been directly responded to. In person, he claimed they were
   each simply deleted and ignored. Please knock and I will be glad to provide a copy of the most recent and relevant letter, which was put
   in his door on Thu. Oct. 8th (a week and a half ago). He gave 4 invalid reasons in the original Notice. Eviction is unjust and illegal!
P.S. I've received no eviction hearing or trial date yet and my payee's full Oct. month's rent check was cashed. (920)636-6271 -PipStuart@GMail.Com
Thank you.
I am reading ...
I've readd it.
May I ask questions ?
Yes. Please do.
Ok.
Thank you.
Who is your letter to ?
Probably something like a Sheriff or other law-enforcement agent who might be enlisted to force me out.
How do you feel about anyone who happens to pass by -- knowing about something that (I happen to believe) is none-of-their-business ?
Hmm. Well while I agree that it ought to be nobody else's business, my upstairs corner of this 8-plex receives very little unfamiliar traffic, and my primary concern is dissuading any officials from forcing entry into my apartment and removing me without concern or consideration.
Especially if they've been mis-informed about the situation and would be acting unjustly and illegally, and can be made aware of that ahead of application of force, if posted on the outside words on pages could avoid (or at least significantly delay) such an unwelcome result.
Thank you.
I'm reading ...
Good.
Have you ever had a "visit" from a sheriff before (in any U.S. state) ?
Yes. Probably back in California a few times, that I can't remember at all well right now. Sheriffs have been involved in my jail custody and transport to mental-hospitals here in Wisconsin a couple times at least too.
Good.
Did they ever forcibly enter your apartment ?
Not that I'm certain of. Someone definitely entered my apartment last month, while I was taken and involuntarily placed into a Fon-du-Lac mental-hospital for those 6 Days. There wasn't particular evidence of entrance requiring force at that time though. They probably had Doug's key.
That entry was while you were NOT home.   Correct ?
Correct.
You have a doorbell that works ?
No.
So -- if I come to your door -- I would knock -- yes ?
Yes.
Good.
You wanted to go on -- with more ?
Best to text-message me first, if you have a mobile phone, so that I know to expect you.
I don't think the Sheriff would do that.   Agreed ?
Agreed. Sheriffs probably would not be so courteous.
Ok.
May I "play" the sheriff now ?
If you think doing so could be worthwhile. Yes.
Good.
Here I go.
I have an order to evict you.
I am not going to text you before I come.
When I get there -- I am going to knock on your door.
       Your response will be ?
"Can you please read the note taped to the door?"
I now (highly) suspect that this tenant is going to trouble.
Is that what you want me to be thinking ?
I don't know. Maybe. Opening the door is probably too risky.
Because ?
Then they can much more easily just barge in and force their will.
Do you have a back door ?
No.
Good.
Am I (as the sheriff) aware of that ?
Yes.
Of course I do.   As the sheriff -- it is my job to know such things.
Do I know that you are home ?
Of course I do.  
I just heard your voice.
I'm coning in.
There are 3 ways that can happen.
(a)  you open the door
(b)  I use a key
(c)  I (forcibly) do a "door-opening".
Do you agree that I AM coming in ?
Yes.
Which way do you believe would cause me to be most open to hear anything which you'd like to say ?
Probably (a).
lol
üòä
Probably ?!          (interobang  bang  bang)
So ...
(a)
Would you like to do that -- instead of asking me to read your letter on the door ?
I'd strongly prefer if you could please read the note first, since it might explain to you why I should be allowed to remain in place and not need to open the door.
Obviously -- you've never a sheriff.
This is not my first rodeo.
Do you know how many times I have been out to evict a tenant from their apartment ?
Probably many.
In fact -- just in the past couple of months ?
Yep.
Absolutely.
And -- here is how my (educated-by-experience) mind works.
When I knock -- and the door is opened by the tenant --
I'm happy.   My ears are open -- and what the tenant has to say -- is what I want to hear.
You might say that -- when the tenant opens the door --
I am on his side.
This is good for the tenant.
Dad, maybe you're right about how a sheriff might behave and expect for things to go easily, but I do not want to be forced out, and it's so much easier for them to do that if I open the door.
Need I tell you what happens inside of me -- when the tenant does not wish to open the door ?
I am the sheriff.
This role-playing is tedious and speculative... to me it seems anyway.
If you go willingly -- fine.
How do you know how they'll think, what they're likely to say, etc.?
Is this exercise really even useful?
I'm running out of patience for this.
But -- if you choose to only go (unwillingly) -- that's ok too.
My order was to see that you go.
I was not told HOW to make it happen.
This exercise is over.
You asked for it.
You have terminated it.
I have nowhere else to go! Forcing me out will make me and my cat homeless. I have nobody who can help me keep my belongings. I'm a disabled man, being discriminated against unfairly.
If it was not helpful -- ignore it please.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks Dad. I'm glad you feel that I ‚ù§
you too.
You're welcome Son.
Well thanks also for trying to help me with that scenario. I guess if there's any chance you could please first-thing Monday morning, hire me any Oshkosh-local eviction-fighting attorney, I would be extremely grateful. I think this could be serious worthwhile (non-pretend) help you could provide me and Darj.
You're welcome.
I don't believe I was any help.
Do you agree ?
I think your sheriff portrayal may have helped me slightly, for what I might encounter and could better anticipate somewhat. We'll see I guess. Well, I have lots of other important stuff to work on, to get as prepared as I can for potential disaster striking me and Darj here soon.
Getting me a lawyer and real legal defense would be substantial help.
Yes.   I believe you do.have important stuff to work on.
Have you found an attorney who is willing to take your case ?
No pro-bono lawyer has been found yet. Looks like Monday itself will be the earliest next opportunity to try to do so, which may already be too late. Hopefully you and I will be able to chat again Friday evening, if I still have a home, Darj, computers, internet-access, electricity, etc..
How many did you talk to ?
Just 2, who both declined due to my case not seeming to be worth their time, for little to no money that I can directly afford. If I am made homeless before Friday, and maybe never get to speak to you again through chat or otherwise, thanks for all the relatively nice times we've been able to try to enjoy together. I'll try to save as many of your old letters as I can too, since they're valuable to me too... but there's a pretty significant chance I won't be able to save much, if anything. I'll do the best I can with whatever happens.
I hope you have a good night and a good rest of your life, if we can't reconnect. Thanks for whatever good you've done for me and with me. Bye.
Philip.
We are not finished.
0'10-18-20 - 1804 Gtime / 1704 Ptime
 
Good Afternoon Philip.
 
Thank you for our chat last evening.
 
Over the past couple of days -- I have been spending
major portions of my time on 2 different things.
 
One is:  an expected presentation -- to Stanford
University, in Palo Alto.
Hello Dad. You're welcome.
Thank you too.
 
And the other is you.  I have been thinking about you,
-- and Darjee, and your belongings, quite a bit too.
 
You had suggested that maybe we could chat again next
Friday, October 23, 2020 at 2000 G / 1900 P.
 
     I would like that.  Thank you Pip.
 
However.  I have decided that I shall also be
looking for a "chat-call" from you (if you wish)
on Sunday (the 18th)
and Monday (the 19th) -- at our regular time.
 
Whether either of those occur (or not) -- it is
my fervent hope that you shall be keeping your
"Mallard Roof" -- until a move back to our
beloved California seems appropriate.
I'm feeling a lot better today than I was last night. I was stressed out and worried and kinda panicked and feeling hopeless and lost and expecting I might have to kiss everything I have and love goodbye.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
-Dad
üòä
  
0'10-18-20 - 1808 Gtime / 1708 Ptime
Thank you so much for all your messages here now! Yes. Chatting later tonight and tomorrow night too sounds good to me as well.  üòä
I look forward to doing so.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
Actually -- now that I see that you are here (now)
-- would you like to chat now ?
Okay.
Good.
I have a question.
How did you see me so quickly.
?
Do you have some sort bell that tells you
when a chat-message is coming in ?
Or -- did my photo of Darjee catch your eye ?
üòä
I was in another virtual desktop changing my background music stream on YouTube and I heard the alert notific8ion sound-effects assoC8d with chat message deliveries from you, so I switched over to my GMail one to see your entries.
Can I install an "alert" like that ?
I'm not sure. I have no recent experience with any MicroSoft Windows of any modern flavor.
In spite of this, maybe running FireFox instead of InternetExplorer or Edge could be a way you might gain such capability too.
Chrome or Brave might do the trick too.
When you open a video chat -- I automatically get an audio signal -- as long as I do not have my speakers volume turned down.
There might be options for any of them to allow for audible alert notific8ions and default volume levels at which to produce them.
And I did not have to do anything to set that up.
But on regular (text only) chats -- I get no such audio.
Maybe your window focus has to be away from the one containing your chat for it to qualify as something to sound off about?
Well thank you anyway.
'Tis not important now.
Let's talk about you & Darjee now.
You're welcome. Hope my ideas might help you eventually gain this useful capability.  üòä
Ok ?
Okay.
You turn.
Go ahead please.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Did you like the "hole-in-the-roof" image that I sent you ?
Darjee and I have enjoyed a very pleasant day today. She's gotten many sweet serene naps, as she deserves and which constantly warms my heart. We've both basked in some direct sunlight, which often remains unavailable here due to regular and persistent cloud-layers.
Yes. Thank you for the image.
You are welcome.
I'm glad about the sunlight.
It is good for us.
Indeed.
üòä
I've also been doing some potent self-discovery today, which has been emotional and astonishing and mostly optimistic, hopeful, and inspiring.
Yes ?
I'm gaining some confidence that there are many ways that I might realize at least some of my highest ambitions.
I'm leaning in.
Go on please.
I can expect that accomplishing any of them by any means is unlikely to be in any way particularly easy, but it's nice to at least imagine that they're possible in more than just a tiny number of routes.
You are correct.
Care to share a few ?
(A)  keeping a roof over you and Darjee.
(B)  ?
Okay. I'll try to present a few of the ones that seem best to share, yeah.
Great.
Go on please.
I aspire to get eventually introduced to both Natalie Wynn and Lindsey Stirling. Thereafter, I hope to get to know (and become somewhat well-known by) each of them, such that we can remain friends, comrades, buddies, pals, chums, confidants, care-givers, cohorts, side-kicks, allies, competitors, peers, mentors, challengers, intim8s, dears, and darlings for each other. Maybe eventually also lovers.  üòä
Oops. s/Thereaftar/Thereafter/;
Oops again. I couldn't see that it already was spelled correctly. My eye-sight keeps getting worse (progressively more and more far-sighted). I can't see my screens clearly enough at usual distance to avoid blurring and mistakes in perception of what is being displayed in the details.
I know the program.
In early 1994 -- at the age of 50¬Ω -- I first noticed that I occasionally needed glasses to read.
But it was not critical.
To be candid and rather lewd, I eventually would probably gr8ly enjoy ejacul8ing inside both Natalie and Lindsey, after some time that they've both decided amongst themselves who would rather be aliased as "Glory" and the other as "Power". I want to cum in Glory and Power.  üòâ
A year and a half later -- at the age of 52 -- I bought my first pair of reading glasses -- in August of 1995.
I've required reading glasses for most of my adulthood, and continually strengthening magnific8ion levels (or multiple pairs of glasses being worn at once) as time passes.
And -- for the past 25 years -- I have been getting by with "drug store" reading glasses.
During my 2 recent vacations (in 2008 & 2012) -- I had no trouble driving my (rented) Mustangs at all.
I have too for the past decade. I have to wear 2 at once to read any typically sized print on paper, or to write almost anything. The strongest drug-store pairs I can find are almost always inadequ8 for such purposes when worn alone.
However -- earlier this year -- there was a new development.
Fuzziness.   I would not be able to drive a car safely anymore -- with my eyesight in its current condition.
But.   I do not need better eyesight to conduct FTR Seminars.
I will need some auxiliary help (in various areas) -- but I can still stand up in front of an audience -- and see faces of people in front of me -- well enough to chat with them -- and share our FTR stuff.
So.   All is perfect.
Anyway.
Enough about my eyesight.
Thank you for the update on your eye-stuff.
I know what you mean about various powers of glasses.
One of the problems I have is that my vision-ability changes from day to day.
And even (sometimes) over the course of a single day.
In 1995 -- I started with 1.75 glasses.
In the 25 years since -- I have also picked up 2.25 -- 2.75 -- and even a pair of 4.00.
Quite weirdly -- the ones I use most often (and am using right now at my computer) are the 1995 pair of 1.75.
Most of the time l8ly, I require wearing 2 pairs of 3.5 or 3.75 at once in order to read and write.
Wow!
My M.H.T. is outside here. I have to get dressed and run out to her vehicle to take my medic8ion. Be back in probably less than 10 minutes.
Take your time Pip.
I'll be here.
üòä
0'10-18-20 - 1856 Gtime / 1756 Ptime
Thanks. I'm back.
0'10-18-20 - 1904 Gtime / 1804 Ptime
Good.
Me too.
Who was your MHT today ?
I don't yet know how to properly spell her name, but it's something like: "Kelsey". I think she's the most attractive M.H.T. of the bunch and close to the nicest as well.
Great.
All's good ?
Not "all" is good, but many things are, at least.
lol
Things'll get better.
I faith have in you Pip.
üòä
Some will. Maybe even many or eventually most, but still probably not all.
Hmm.
We'll see.
I'd rather you have belief in me, with reason! Faith is not a tr8 I esteem particularly highly. I think it's vastly over-r8d to believe in anything in the absence of reason.
Ok.
I believe in you Pip.
Better ?
Belief in things based primarily on hopes and desires sounds fool-hardy to me.
Yes.
Thanks.
You are my boss.
Not really.
lol
If I say so -- it is so.
Sorry.
You don't get to vote on whether I make you my boss.
üòä
Your son, who may sometimes be capable of teaching you some things, but not really your director, over-seer, manager, boss.
So -- we agree to disagree.
At least I don't feel as though I am or ought to be your boss.
I can live with that.
Fair enough. I guess it is your decision as to who you consider your best boss.
Thank you for being "fair" with me.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're welcome. I strive to be almost as fair as possible in most things. I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
Thank you.
I receive it richly.
My d8-clock just read:  "KAIMIDAS"  for:  "Sun. Oct. 18th 18:13:10:28 -0500 2020"  üòä
And -- what does "kaimidas" mean ?    
               Is it some kind of an automobile muffler ?
Like "Le Chaim!" in Hebrew for "To Life!" && I'm Dad's Awesome Son for the hour, minute, second, and phass.
K is Year 2020. A is Month October. I is Day 18th. M is time-zone -0500. The last 4 are hmsp.
Yep.   Got it.
And "MIDAS" like the king who touched his food and family into gold. Heh.
You "teached" me that a few years back.
Thank you.
Welcome.
or ...
You shall become the "Midas" in our family Pip.
In fact -- you are in the process of that "becoming" now !!
Yep. The top is read right-to-left for I think Chet and Yod making "Chai" or "Life" and the other is a typical toast over Kosher wine and such, like Mogen David, Maneischewitz (probably misspelled somewhat badly), and Kedem grape-juice.
Maybe I will become some kind of King eventually, but hopefully not a cautionary sort of fable fairy-tale about what not to blunder into with greed and power and lack of fore-sight.
King -- no.
But powerful -- yes.
After you learn how to wield it.
(as you just said)
I might make you eat those words someday.  üòâ
  I'm pretty sure I stand a good chance of becoming some real kind of King eventually. Maybe King over the whole world, or even universe.
Not over me My Lord.
We'll see about that.
You shall always remain My Teacher & My Lord.
You teach me things too. Thank you for all the ways that you do so, whether intentional or not. I appreC8 it all.
You must first learn a few things -- and one of them is -- that being a king -- is a terrible curse.
You are welcome My Lord.
Really?! How so?
üòä
All in good time.
I'm quite curious what about kingship could necessarily be either terrible, or approprE8 to characterize as a curse.
Please give me some hints at least?
Do you remember in the Old Testament -- The Israelites had judges -- but they pleaded with God to give them a king.
He knew that it would be a terrible curse unto them -- but they incessantly beseeched Him to give them a king.
So -- He finally relented -- and gave them a king.
And -- they hated it.
Many people think that we are to "serve" God.
No so.
HE is to serve us.
Even if that's all true, how was that a curse for the king?
When we do not see The EWO in Him -- and we do not say "Thy will be done" to Him --
He says "Thy will be done" to us.
"EWO"?
There are (basically) 2 ways in life to become healthy, happy, and wise.
One is:  to do what the EWO suggests.
The other is:  to go out and bump into walls, and get skinned knees, and bloodied noses (on our own).
Our Father would prefer that we choose #1.
I have no idea what EWO is supposed to stand for, or whatever. Please clarify.
But -- He is very patient -- and exceedingly polite.
He knows that we are not meant to serve Him.
He is meant to serve us.
So -- when we want the "bloody nose" path --
He says:  "Go on My Son.   Thy will be done."
Either way will bring you wisdom.
And getting wisdom (as your grandpa Solomon said) is the important thing.
Not -- how you go about getting it.
(//)
Oh.
Yes.
Sorry.
       EWO  =  Eternal Wise One
Another of the ton of "names" given to God.
I seriously doubt anyone alive so far can clearly know whether any god (or especially some primary pseudo-singular God-head Trinity Echad) even exists reliably at all... or ever did.
Yep.
Got it.
Sorry.
Thanks for expanding EWO. I also doubt anything is ever absolutely eternal.
Why do I (constantly) slip back into talking about some (supposed) "guy-in-the-sky" -- who you know:  does not exist.
Sorry Pip.
üòä
If God's very existence is uncertain, how can you presume to know that He serves us p8iently and with anything resembling wisdom?
I believe that the 40+ "pen-holders" of The Scriptures believed that He existed.
Any number of gods might have existed, somehow... and could still, including just some single God. There's scarcely any evidence for either.
So -- I believe in their belief.
Moses, Solomon, Paul, John, James, et cetera.
Ah. So the belief of 40+ scribes is primarily enough to convince you to believe too?
My Rabbi (actually your Rabbi too) when I took you, and Angie, and Tim, along with me to synagogue in Tarzana -- was once asked:  What is the primary belief in Judaism ?
He said:
Why not also believe in Ra and Thor and Zeus and Satan and Buddha and Vishnu etc. then too?
                " God is One. "
Numerous scribes believed strongly in all of them too.
The Trinity is technically 3, not 1 though.
I like many of the teachings of Buddha -- and Confucius -- and Gandhi -- and others.
But I (also) like a lot of the stuff from Paul, and Mo and the boys too.
I am not entirely partial to The Bible.
Yeah, but so how do you distinguish between the sincere beliefs of some scribe/authors being of divine inspir8ion and origin while others fail to rise to that level? Their beliefs being contagious, or simply the numbers of each seem inadequ8 to sepR8.
In FTR Seminars -- I tell our stus that they do not have to believe in a God -- in order for the FTR stuff to work in their lives. 
If they do -- fine.
If they don't -- doesn't matter.
The FTR stuff has been working wonders in the lives of our stus -- no matter what their spiritual persuasion may be -- or -- even if they have none at all.
How so?
Ok.
An example.
More specifically, how and in what ways has any FtR stuff worked anything like wonders in the lives of multiple stus?
My (biological) son, Philip -- likes one of the Axioms (which are a sub-set) of the FTR Piece of Light #6.  ¬∂  How has that served him (the boy named Philip) ?   He (through that belief) has become a very masterful wordsmith -- and great communicator -- in the English Language.   Quite a gift to his fellow-man -- Philip has become.  ¬∂  Ahd --
He ain't done yet.
That's for sure !!
Thank you for all of that. Very nice. I'm inclined to agree with almost all of it. I question the "through that belief" part as being properly represent8ive of the routes by which the rest has become something like the present reality... however, I've never attended any FtR Seminar (that I know of). How have your Seminar stus (and your FtR material) worked wonders?
Thank you for that.
I believe the best way to answer that -- is:  to let you see for yourself -- and talk to some of them.
 
The "Palo Alto" presentation is tentatively
targeted for the late-Spring of 2021. 
Would you like to come along on that one ?
I'm pretty sure I'd very much like to attend such an event with you there, yes! As long as the schedule does not collide with the timing of next Year's Perl Conference, or it's "in the Cloud" again and I can attend virtually from Palo Alto (or wherever internet access remains available) and that I have some adequ8 new Fujitsu LifeBook laptop by then to do so with, sounds gr8 to me. Thanks for the invite!
Ok.   Let's try to make that happen then.  
However --I suggest that you (start today) to find someone to look after Darjee while we are gone.
I expect it may be a 3 or 4 day thing.
Ok ?
Okay. Please share with me more specifics when you can, as it gets closer. I will also probably need to seek permission ahead of time from my Winnebago County psychiatrist, Dr. David Zerrien, since he can authorize me to leave temporarily while still under my mental-health commitment.
Wilco.
Should we invite Dr. Z. & Kelsey too ?
Why not. Yeah, let's! They could both use some schooling.  üòâ
lol]
I (certainly) think so.
Good idea Pip !!
üòä
Glad you thought of it, and it's also my good idea too!  üòä
Would you like to pay for their plane tickets ?
FTR is paying for yours.
No way. Very unlikely I could afford both a new Fujitsu LifeBook and their air-fares by that time. They've gotta cover their own travel expenses, I think. Just inviting them with a brochure or something ought to be enough.
Whatever you say Pip.
You are the "Bruce Springsteen" !!
                            The Boss.
But one thing ...
You must invite them.
Not me.
Yes ?
Yes.
Good.
Stone.
Well was there anything else you might like to chat about still tonight?
Yep.
One.
Well ... 4 I guess.
#1  -  Are we "on" for tom night ?
Yes.
Good.
#2  -  Thank you for tonight Son.
#3  -  I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're most welcome. Thank you too. I enjoyed chatting tonight very much as well.
Yes, I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
#4  -  Have a gr8 Monday.
I hope you do also.  üòä
Thank you Pip.
I got it !!
I will if you will.
üòä
Good night Dad.
Good night Pip.

Yo, Dad. How are you tonight?
Good Evening Philip.
I'm good.
Glad to see you.
And how was Darjee's Monday ?
Pretty swell probably. Thanks for asking. She's in gr8 shape. Yeah. So dear.  üòä
  >~..^<  *purrmeow*
                  Grr8 !!
üòä
Glad to heeere it.
Have you seen my public Darj picture collection before?
I've seen 3 or 4.
How many are in the collection ?
HTTPS://Photos.App.Goo.gl/E7wUCrfsuwSLLRif2 should work.
Great collection.
Sweet !!
Thank you.
You even have my "Book Girl" in there.
Nice.
You're quite welcome. Thanks! Yeah, Darjee is a treasure.  üòä
And Pip's inaugural "up-to-the-mike" too.
You were 4 there.
Yep. Cool.
You certainly were.
Are.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Is it PCA time yet ?
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
üòä
Thank you Pip.
I ‚ù§
 that you ‚ù§
 me.
Sure, yeah, it can be PCA time.
And -- I ‚ù§
 ‚ù§
ing you .
Good.
Yours or mine ?
Whose PCA first ?
Please go ahead. I'm not sure what could or should be on mine for now. Maybe I'll think of or remember a PCA item of my own for l8r. We'll see.
Ok.
Thanks.
First item on my list is:
Get a "Roof Report" from Pip.
Okay, yeah. Well Darj and I still are thankfully remaining under our familiar roof. Hopefully we can stay until we find a better roof to reloc8 to being under for a while.
I wrote Doug C. (LandLord) another letter this morning and delivered it to his office mail-slot. He probably won't respond in any way to it either (like the previous ones I've left, and voicemails also). I can paste in the text of it, if you're interested in reading and maybe critiquing it?
I'd like to read it.
We can consider the critiquing part (maybe) after.
Hello Captain's Cove LandLord Doug Carder,      Monday, October 19th of 2020
  Just as a reminder, back on Tue. Sep. 22nd, you served me a 28-Day Tenancy
Termination Notice which indicated that I should move out by today (which is
technically only 27-Days after that initial date, as I count up until now).
  I have not found any better place to live yet. Can you please be kind and
grant me an extension? My car has not been running, so I can only look close
to bus-routes and my payee doesn't have enough money for me to consider most
available options. I need more time to look and apply for new places please.
  I still don't understand any reasons why you have wanted to kick me out in
the first place. I wrote you a detailed letter about this and hand-delivered
it through your office-door mail-slot on Thu. Oct. 8th, but got no response.
  If you still want to force me out soon, would you please sign the written
agreement below and return it to me, which is from Wis. Stats. Ann. ¬ß 704.05
(5)(a)(1)? From that section, I want us to agree to the contrary, stating I
intend to abandon absolutely none of my property. I aim to keep everything!
  Thank you very much. I hope you have a nice day.  Sincerely,  -Pip Stuart

From: HTTPS://Docs.Legis.Wisconsin.Gov/statutes/statutes/704/05 (5)(a)(1) :
On Mon. Oct. 19th of 2020, I ______________________ (LandLord, Doug Carder)
acknowledge that ______________________ (Captain's Cove Tenant, Pip Stuart)
will not be abandoning any of his property and will be collecting all of it
as quickly as he is able to. Furthermore, I will be disposing of none of it.

P.S. Who did you let into my apartment back while I was in the hospital, and
what all did they do inside? I ask this because my expensive 32-inch monitor
was permanently damaged in 2 visible areas during that time. It appears that
they must have stabbed the computer screen twice with maybe something sharp.
Thank you.
I'm reading  ...  ...  ...  ...  ... 
Done reading.
Any response from Mr. C. ?
Nope.
I guess we'll just w8.
Have you found someone to care for Darjee during your trip to Palo Alto ?
Of course not. I have no idea about d8s or any real details yet.
Does he live on the premises ?
Did I sppel that correctly ?
I'm even skeptical you know anyone or can find anyone who would be willing to attend a Seminar there, supposedly titled "Fix-the-Radio".
I don't think he does. Not sure.
You probably spelled "premises" correctly. I can get it wrong sometimes too though.
Well -- I think I know 2.
Aren't Kelsey & the Z-doctor from Silicone Valley ?
Hell no.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Nobody in Wisconsin except me seems to be from California.
But didn't Dr. Z. attend the Medical School at Stanford ?
Maybe. He's certainly not from Cali though.
Well ok.
Take a look at where his diploma is from -- next time you visit him please.
Probably can't. We don't visit in-person at all this Year due to CoVid-19.
Ah ha.
Is that good ?
Somewhat.
Do you do sessions by phone ?
Yup.
And that goes well ?
Not always. Sometimes.
And the in-person visits were better -- or ?
If you want to see my hand-written version of the original letter, I've just made it a new Photos album at: HTTPS://Photos.App.Goo.gl/6VaCvjSvhSjM7Dzw5
Hmm. I guess the phone appointments have been slightly worse than the in-person ones used to be. Both have sucked... err I mean leave plenty of room to be desired, recently.
s/leave/left/;
Ah yes.
Thank you for the originals.
How can I rotate them ?
You're welcome. Any thoughts about what you've read or seen in any of my albums?
I don't know. Probably some utility or another.
Did Michelle get back to you from your Oct 8 2020 correspondence ?
Michelle just made 3 photo-copies of the letter to Doug. She didn't read any of it, apparently.
Ok.
Yeah, she got back to me with the copies, in time for me to deposit one copy into Doug's office mail-slot still during business hours on the 8th.
What's up with your car ?
Battery probably connection problem.
Connection ?
Sounds like that oughta be an easy fix -- no ?
I don't know.
Can't afford tow or repair right now, pretty sure.
Well -- put your car in a box -- and UPS it to me.
I'll take a look.
Umm yeah, that'll save us on postage, right going through UPS, huh?
lol
                 Not sure.
         üòä
Bus stops right at your crib -- yes ?
Yep. Routes 1 and 4 transfer to each other just beyond my place here.
Good.
And the 1 and 4 go how close to your 2 main food stores ?
4 passes both pretty closely.
Well -- here's what I say about that:

                Did you go to lunch ?
     My video on you has gone black.
                    Hmm.      I seem to have lost you.
I'm here.
Oh.
   I'm so relieved.
Just laughing a lot about a 7cloud YouTube song which said: "Never let me go!" and I thought about it as could pertain to pissing and pooping, so I'd ask: "#1 or number 2?"  üòâ
Well -- that's good --
      I think.
Then maybe romantically provide some "surgery" of sorts on Valentine's or BirthDay to stitch urethra or anus shut.
             Shall we move on to my 2nd PCA ?
Or -- is it your turn ?
Okay.
Me ?
Ok.
I'll go.
2nd PCA on the way.
 
Apparently Dr. Z. got his degree from the
Medical College of Wisconsin (in Milwaukee)
in '86 -- but (at sometime) he seems to have
(also) attended the USF in Tampa (Florida).
 
I'm guessing he is (quite possibly) from
Wisconsin -- as he has had a number of
residences in that state.  But -- besides
Tampa -- he also lived in Minnesota for
a time.
 
He and President Obama are the same age.
 
(//) 
Hmm. Okay. I guess good to know. Thanks.
So who else in the world that you know of also calls God the Eternal Wise One?
You're welcome.
Not sure if it's "good to know" or not.
          Time will reveal all things.
I doubt it.
Time alone doesn't necessarily reveal all that much, so pretty certainly not "all" things.
         You are my "corrector".
Thank you Pip.
No prob.
-lem ?
Yep.
      You tallk phunnie.
                     But I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
‚ù§
you too.
Thank you.
Well, I guess we can chat more again Friday, or maybe another night sooner, if you'd like?
        [ more applause for you goes here ]
Friday's fine with me Son.
The 23rd at the regular hour ?
Cool. Let's shoot for then, yeah.
Thank you for tonight.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
And I'm glad that you and Darjee are still roofed.
You're welcome Pip.
Us too. Hopefully we remain until better place found.
Have a good 4 daze.
Actually -- I like where you are.
       So.   You two have a nice Monday evening snooze.
And we'll look for your noses again in about 94¬Ω hours.
Good night Pip.
Sounds good.
Good night Dad.

Good Evening Dad.
5'10-23-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
How has your week been?
Darj and I have had quite a good one.
Mine was productive.
Want to tell me about your "good one" ?
Good.
Okay. It seems as though there might be good reasons to believe that almost all life will eventually get to live almost forever, partially due to my hopes and dreams and efforts.
Sounds interesting.
Go on please.
Not sure where else to go with it. Care to ask any questions?
Sure.
Thank you for the offer.
I'd like to hear more about your "hopes and dreams and efforts" of this past week.
Could you share those with me ?
Well I have almost always hoped and dreamt of being somewhat instrumental in lengthening the lives of the good, maybe somewhat at the expense of the length of lives of those who could be comparatively said to be "evil".
This week, I've had some ideas to indic8 that this is becoming more of a reality.
My intentions and activities all may contribute to such outcomes somewhat.
Those "activities" that you refer to are what ?
Living my life in accordance with the principles that would underpin such beliefs and taking mostly minor, but also so major, steps toward bringing about realities that would reflect such a characteriz8ion of life itself being made manifest... if that makes sense.
s/also so/also some/;
It does -- yes.
Could you tell me more about those "principles" please ?
It appears as though almost everyone I've ever known experiences some form of meaningful life within my mind and body.
In addition to continuing to live on in their own bodies and minds.
One major principle is to so strongly prefer truth to any falsehood.
Honesty being the best policy.
Loving everyone and everything being another crucial policy.
And -- do you love everyone ?
I try to, yes.
Even those who want nothing to do with you ?
And those who think poorly of you ?
Including the evil, the wicked, those filled with deceit, my enemies, etc. and yes, those who want nothing to do with me or think poorly of me, yes.
Good.
How do you love them ?
Through what actions & ways ?
Intentionally leaving them the space to live on and do whatever they think best.
Thinking there's inherent worth and value in every individual life, and also the non-living too.
Sounds good to me.
What has brought you to these determinations this past week ?
I've had transcendent moments of tearful joy mainly on Tuesday, but also a few other times since, filled with visions of beauty and grace that the future is a wonderful place that we are almost all probably headed towards together.
Maybe you will get to live almost forever, to see much of it realized too. This makes me happy.
          Happy is good.            I like when you are happy.
It has been sort of a culmin8ion of many different lines of thinking which brought me to these determin8ions this past week.
I applaud your culmin8ions !!
Thanks. Yeah. I'm not certain they're correct or inevitable, but just indic8ive of some maybe somewhat increasing likelihoods that are pretty inspiring and optimistic.  üòä
        I applaud inspiring and optimistic too.
Highest aspir8ions.
üòä
I am in favor of Pip having (and walking toward) his highest apir8ions.
If I could be in any way instrumental in bringing about almost eternal life to everyone and everything, I think my life is clearly one well-lived.  üòä
         I cannot disagree with that idea.
                                   For sure !!
     I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thank you Dad. I ‚ù§
you too!
Thank you Pip.
I've also come to somewhat of a realiz8ion that I am not unlovable or unloved. I love gr8ly and am loved gr8ly. This has been obscured, but is becoming clearer and invigor8ing.
          I agree with every word there.
Your mind is sharp -- and your spirit clear.
Hopefully yours too Dad. Sharp minds and clear spirits sound very good.
                 I believe you speak trutheries.
I sure try to speak and act truthfully.
This has always been my experience with you.
Maybe it's life-giving, to act and speak in accordance with truth.
Why do you say "maybe" ?
Because it's probably a general principle, which has caveats and exceptions, probably for ultim8ly good and important reasons.
Ok.   Go on please.
Almost every principle probably has important exceptions.
Including ones that give rise to life that's almost eternal.
That is certainly a reasonable idea.
Glad you think so too.
I do.
So how productive was your week?
Tons of new FTR Scripts drafted.
Thank you for asking.
Gr8.
üòä
Me thinks so 2.
You're welcome.
So far -- we seem to have enough Scripts to do a 70 to 75-hour Seminar.
Of course -- we have no intention of ever doing that.
Just an idea of the repertoire that we have amassed so far.
Lengthy!
Extensive.
Maybe approaching exhaustive?
At least exhausting?  üòâ
Rather.  
Personal Development (which is the overriding subject of all of our Seminars) is (truly) an inexhaustible topic.
I believe it.
For the most part.
I have laughed a lot this past week. Had a lot of hilarious ideas. Many of them rel8d to abundant pee and poo. Pretty silly.
Laughter is good.
Interpret8ions of romantic ideas like "Never let me go." responded with: "#1 or #2?"
It is one of the 8 "Stress Alleviators" which we teach in RTG.
"Never let me down." leading to escape-velocity.
/RTG/  /FTR/
Oshkosh GO transit being about defec8ing in public buses. The ancient game of Go being about urin8ion and defec8ion. Silliness.
I'm glad you are happy.
Yes, laughter can alleV8 a lot of stress. I agree.
üòä
üòä
I'm going to take a smoke break out in the living room. Be back to chat more in about 10 minutes or so.
Ok.
I think I shall join you.
But I will stay in the room which I am currently in.
5'10-23-20 - 2057 Gtime / 1957 Ptime
Back.
5'10-23-20 - 2104 Gtime / 2004 Ptime
That (certainly) was not 10 minutes.
But --
Maybe I smoked the cigar faster than usual.
you did say "about" --
so I shall accept it.
üòä
Was that a "blue" wrapper again ?
It was Yellow Vanilla Cheyenne.
Ah yes.
I know Cheyenne well.
I sat behind her in 5th grade.
I like to rot8 through, Pink StrawBerry, Red WildCherry, Orange Peach, Yellow Vanilla, Green SweetMint, and Blue XoticBerry... all Cheyenne.
Golden Hair.
And she smelled like vanilla too.
Nice.
She was.
Not sure where she is now.
Someone said she started a cigar factory in Idaho.
Not sure whether that is true or not.
Cool. I like cigars.
I suspect it is not.
I believe the "Cheyenne" factory Is in central east-coastal Florida --
near Disney World.
Grover, North Carolina on the box.
Oh well.
What do I know anyway.
üòä
Grover ?
Looks like it.
Small print is very hard to read, even with 2 lenses.
Yep.   It appears you are correct.
Their factory is in Grover NC -- which is just inches from the South Carolina border.
Nice.
34 miles east of Charlotte NC.
I'd really like to try their Churchills blend sometime. They're a good deal more expensive for 10-packs than the cigarette-sized 20-packs of the 6 flavors I mentioned that I get normally.
194 miles NE of Atlanta Georgia.
Yes.   I noticed that about the Cheyenne's pricing.
Their company's slogan is:
            The largest small tobacco company in America.
And their sale slogan is:
            Why pay more for what you're looking for.
Cheyenne has made me more of a brand-loyalist with tobacco.
Then you have made them happy too.
Good job Pip.
üòä
Well I think I'm good for chatting for tonight. This has been enough for me. Can we please plan to chat again more tomorrow night, about money and whatever else? Usual time?
Whoops.   Correct that.
Grover NC is 34 miles WEST of Charlotte NC.-- not east.   Sorry.
Tomorrow -- Sat Oct 24 2020  --  2000 G / 1900 P ?
I believe that is a "can do" from this end.
Yep.
Thank you for tonight Pip.
Good one.
Thank you too Dad.
I ‚ù§
you.
I ‚ù§

You're welcome.

KAOMItrY  (Sat Oct 24 18:55:53:34 -0500 2020)
Hello Dad.
6'10-24-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
How was your Shabbat ?
I didn't even recognize it was a Shabbat. I'm not very religious. How was yours?
Mine was very goood.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
The word "Shabbat" in the Hebrew serves 2 purposes.
It means "day of rest" -- and also "Saturday".
My Saturday has been somewhat strained. I've had a few rather deep topics on my mind... things I'm trying to work out or work through. Nothing I feel prepared to get into or attempt to convey to you right now. Maybe eventually.
In the Hebrew -- there is not a separate word for Saturday.
This is also true in Greek, Spanish, and Portuguese.
However -- Latin, English, French, Italian, Hawaiian, and others have 2 separate words for "Sabbath" & "Saturday".
Sort of. Hebrew counts days from Sun-Down, not MidNight like most languages do.
Yep.   This be true.
üòä
Can you read Hebrew?
Sorry your day was strained,
I'd like to hear about it (them things) when you wish to share.
Not now is fine.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Me read Hebrew ?
       Working on it.
Ask me again in about 30 years.
üòä
Thanks for saying you love me, Dad. Once again, I'm uncertain about love, of me, or from me.
Xcellent Pip.
You're welcome.
I used to be capable of reading Hebrew rather slowly (and only sounding it out, not really having a huge vocabulary in it yet to know every meaning behind what words I was pronouncing).
I do not find it to be very easy to master.
I haven't practiced it at all recently though, so my recollection of it has atrophied.
Yep.   This happens.
I still have a large Biblical Hebrew text-book which should provide a strong basis for returning to the language in force, if I find any need to do so and can manage either multiple pairs of glasses or hand-holding either of the fine magnifying glasses you kindly bought me just for such purposes. Thank you for those again.  üòä
You're very welcome.
I also have several Siddurim, a Tanakh, a book of the Talmud, and a Brit HaChadashah (New Covenant) all in Hebrew.
I use my mag-glasses many multiple times every day too.
I don't have all of those books.   But I do have Bibles in a number of languages.
I'm curious, which languages?
Greek & Spanish primarily.
Would you consider yourself fluent in either Greek or Spanish or both, or maybe just intermeD8 or neophyte in either instead?
No -- not "fluent" in either.
I took 2 years of Latin and 2 years of French in high school --
but I am not fluent in either of those either.
Well even being just acquainted with those 4 non-primary languages is probably still quite worthwhile, at least on occasion.
This is very true.
My interest in Spanish is due to the fact that Reading has a (very) heavy component of Hispanic population.
My interest in Greek is mostly because the New Testament was written in it.
Yes. Most cities in the U.S. have notably-sized Spanish-speaking popul8ions. I have encountered it regularly too, of course especially in Los Angeles (being so close to the Mexican border and a Spanish name itself).
However -- I also love studying Greek and Latin because English is derivative of Latin to about 50% -- and Greek to about 25%.
My love of French is (so) about the beauty of that language.
Do you find Spanish to be in any significant ways more or less beautiful than your co-existent knowledge of French?
Actually no.   For beauty of its sound -- I do not find Spanish to be a pretty language at all.   However -- the idea of learning many of its words -- I consider to be of value -- because so many of my local friends speak it.
Nice. I find Spanish to be beautiful, although I've scarcely learned any French with which to potentially compare it to another Romance language on anything like even footing.
My high school offered only 2 foreign languages to us.
Spanish sure is widespread about the globe and particularly in all 3 American continents.
4 years of Latin -- in 9th through 12th grades.
2 years of French in 11th & 12th.
My interest in Latin was (as I said before) for the sake of coming to be more familiar with the origins of English words
My first year of Latin went well.   I passed it.
I failed my 2nd year of it.
But I was ok with that -- as I was looking forward to studying French -- beginning in 11th Grade.
I passed my first year of French.
And then -- true to my pattern -- I failed my 2nd year of French.
But -- with both of those languages -- I got enough of each of them -- to be quite useful for the 59 years since.
I'm glad I took both of them.
I'm glad you did too.
Thank you Pip.
I took I think it was 2 years of Spanish in High School and basically cheated my way through so that I could devote more of my time to learning to code on my calcul8or. L8r in life, I wished I had paid closer attention during those classes and done more of the assignments myself, since fluency would have proven so valuable in so many situ8ions since.
Yes.   I got it.
In college, I studied Nihongo (Nipponese, or Japanese) for a couple of quarters, then began learning Hebrew as I became a Messianic Jew for a while. I scarcely know any languages at all, but am glad to know bits and pieces of many.
But we can have do-overs on most of such kinds of regrets.
Yeah. That's quite a good thing.
It's nice that you got to do those 2 (Hebrew & Japanese) at Irvine.
Good for you Pip.
I know the "AlphaBets" of English, Spanish, Hebrew, Greek, and Nihongo... can count to 5 in Hmong, can count to 10 in French and German (in addition to doing so for of course English, but then also Spanish and Nihongo). It's quite useful to have at least some minor awareness, and familiarity with proper pronunC8ions, of various different languages.
I agree.
Back in July of 1999 - I made in my business to get a list of "thank you" in about 370 languages.
No -- I don't have all of them memorized.
But I do know a number of the biggies (the major languages).
Very cool. Right on!
/in/  /it/
Well -- I have a 34-minute "hole" in my screen.
Hmm. Yeah.
          Does this mean we are "almost gone" ?
Can we please talk about money for a while now?
Sure.
I've heard of it.
Francs or Dineros ?
What's your pleasure ?
U.S. Dollars please.
Ok.
Go ahead Pip.
It's your nickel.
Well, about how much money do you have in savings?
Not much.  
My only income is a (rather paltry) Social Security.
Comes monthly.
Hmm. Okay. I was under the impression that you've been able to afford at least 2 flights and vac8ions to Hawai'i within the past dozen years (which is admittedly a rather long and reasonable time-frame within which to save up enough to afford). I also gathered that you are willing to pay for my air-fair to attend one of your FtR Seminars in Palo Alto next Spring. Maybe these gave me the wrong idea that you have had some kind of decent savings to draw from.
You've also indic8d that you spend approxim8ly $200 on food and supplies each week.
Yes.   I'll address 3 of your points in that first paragraph.
I am working with half that, or less most weeks, so imagine you might still be able to help me out financially somewhat.
Okay, go ahead.
(A)  Yes.   The Hawaii trip in October of 2008 took quite a while to save up for.   But it was (certainly) worth all the pinching & scrimping that was required -- to be able to do it !!
(B)  The "Orangification of New England" trip in October of 2012 was somewhat less of a financial "dent" -- as there was no plane fare involved in that one.   Just a rental car.   And the lodging did not cost me $260 per night on that one either -- as 'twas the deal in Kauai.
s/air-fair/air-fare/;
(C)  The (tentatively planned) trip to Palo Alto next year -- is not intended to come out of "my" money.   The FTR company will be paying for that -- both for me -- and for you.   ¬∂   As (of course) will also be the case with the payment of your "narration services" to the FTR mission -- and any other travel perks which FTR sends your way.   ¬∂   Of course -- this is all predicated on FTR income -- of which there has been 0 (zero) since the establishment of the FTR company in August of 2015.   ¬∂   Since then -- the only moneric (money) activity in the FTR domain -- has been "out-goings" -- that is expenditure -- no revenue.   And all of that has come out of my own (Social Security) income.
Okay. Good to know.
I have a lot of pressing needs and lack the funding necessary to afford them. I had hoped that you could assist me financially, but it seems you probably are unable to. Oh well. Looks like I will have to seek supplementary employment to become capable of purchasing the goods and services I'm in need of. Thanks anyway.
Other than money, I have 2 more rather quick PCA items on my list. First, I am leaning toward not being able to attend your FtR Seminar in Palo Alto, but might become more willing to accept your invit8ion as more details surrounding the planned trip solidify. Please keep me informed, as you are able.
I shall.
And the other PCA ?
Second, while I was researching the legality of potential evictions, I discovered a symbol that seems quite similar to the Caesura you described earlier which I drew a couple varE8ions on for you. Hopefully you can see it here:  HTTP://FileFormat.Info/info/unicode/char/a7  which is the "Section" character, but seems quite similar to the character you were looking for. Is it the same?
Thank you for that link.
You're welcome.
The section character ( ¬ß ) is one which I use occasionally -- yes -- along with the paragraph-break character ( ¬∂ ) -- as you are well familiar with.
I believe your question was:
Is the  ¬ß  somewhat similar to a caesura ?
I just searched and found "MUSICAL SYMBOL CAESURA" at:  HTTP://FileFormat.Info/info/unicode/char/1d113
Answer:  maybe (a bit) -- but not really.
Although the  ¬ß  does indicate a "break" (of a sort) in printed material -- it is more of a visual thing (on paper) than the caesura -- which actually signifies a person's "resting".
Be back shortly.
Ah. Right on.
I'm going to your 2nd link now.
Yes.   That  U+1D113  is a caesura -- thank you.
You're welcome.
Is there anything on your PCA for tonight?
There wasn't -- but --
You had just (recently) said:
"Looks like I will have to seek supplementary employment to become capable of purchasing the goods and services I'm in need of."
        I'm not sure that this is the right time to bring this up -- but maybe.
Are you still "in" on becoming the FTR company's Narrator ?
I'm still in on further evalU8ing whether I am sufficiently capable and willing to be Narr8or for FtR.
Ok.
Well -- the only question (really) is about the "willing" part.
Because -- you are capable.
       Have no mullery on that Pip.
Like I tried to indic8 before, I may have objections to putting my voice behind messages that I cannot in good conscience agree with or promote... especially if they seem likely to mislead or misguide people into thinking wrongly about important issues.
But -- take your time.
I had thought that you had "worked your way" through that issue.
But -- if not -- give it more consideration.
Thanks. Yeah, I expect I will have to consider each script somewhat carefully before I can feel comfortable with each particular message.
The reason I brought it up at this moment -- was because of your comment about "seeking supplementary employment to become capable of purchasing the goods and services" which you are in need of.
Yeah, I probably need to find some programming work to start becoming able to afford the goods and services I need in the near-term.
I'm rather skeptical that anyone would be willing to pay even a modest sum of money in order to attend Personal Development Seminars of your design under the title-banner of: "Fix-the-Radio".
lol
Interesting comment.
Maybe I should clear that up right now.
"Fix The Radio" is a term that I can think of no one other that you -- who is familiar with those 3 words (linked together).   We do not promote our Seminars using those 3 words.   They are simply called "Seminars on Personal Development" -- and everyone has a pretty good idea of what "Personal Development" means.   Which is:  bringing me to become a better me.
Ah. Okay.
Personal Development is a big business -- and has been for the better part of the last hundred years.   ¬∂   It has made countless millions of dollars for people like Tony Robbins, Wayne Dyer, Earl Nightingale, Zig Ziglar -- and tons of others that I could go on to name (right off the top of my head right now).   ¬∂   However -- your Dad's version of Personal Development Seminars are quite different from anyone else's have ever been -- in (actually) dozens of ways.   ¬∂   I shall not list all of those way (here & now) for you -- but I shall mention a few.
‚Ä¢  We do not do stadiums & mega-arenas.   ‚Ä¢  We are interested in sharing our lessons with an eye to quality (of instruction) -- not quantity (of attendees).   ‚Ä¢  We have no intention of accumulating zillions of dollars doing this -- but it (certainly) will provide a (very) nice income for our (3 or 4) employees -- of which your Dad is not one.   I neither own the company -- nor do I draw any salary from it.   However -- our Marketing Manager will -- and our Registrar will -- and our Narrator will -- whether that happens to be you (or whomever else). 
(//)
Thanks for mentioning those few ways that are different.
/way/  /ways/
You're welcome.
There are tons of other ways -- but not important at this moment (I think).
What makes it anywhere near "certain" that it will provide any income at all, well before it's even "very nice"?
Good question.
Tony Robbins made (and is continuing to make) millions on giving P.D. Seminars.
So did Wayne, and Zig, and Earl.
Did I ?
Not yet.   But the potential is there.   On the Seminar that we gave back in September of 2015 -- the deal was a "tradeout".   The company we contracted with brought nearly 30 people to our Seminar.   And in lieu of monetary payment -- we were given something from them -- which both they (and I) considered to be of a reasonable (equivalent) value for our services.
Can you sometime soon please send me an audio-recording (or at least a transcript) of the September 2015 Seminar, so that I may contempl8 and assess how worthwhile the material seems to be to me?
I cannot.   Another rule in Our Company is that we do not record (either audio nor video) Our Seminars.   ¬∂   Furthermore -- we so not ever (at our Seminars, or online, or in stores, or in any other place) -- sell anything to our students (or anyone else) -- ever - anytime -- anywhere.   ¬∂   We receive money from our stus for only one thing -- the chair that we "rent" to them -- for the duration of The Seminar.
/so/  /do/
Oh well. Probably count me out then. I would need to evalU8 your material and find it to be valuable, before I could particip8 with any enthusiasm. I remain highly doubtful that you can produce content which anyone would be willing to "rent" a chair for... and "very nice" income seems extremely far from "certain". I wish you well with it. Please feel free to let me know how it goes, if you can and care to at some point.
Has anything that I have ever said to you in the past 43 years been of value to you ?
Has anything that I have said to you in those same years -- been considered by you to be useless ?
Will that also be the case with the materials which we share in Our (Personal Development) Seminars -- not only in your evaluations - and the evaluations of our students ?
Of course it will.   The answer is "yes" to all 3 questions which I have just asked.
Hardly anything you've said has been of significant value to me. I mean, you and Mom taught me to read and write very early. That was quite valuable. As far as advice goes though, most of what you and she have taught me has turned out to be pretty useless, yeah. No, not "of course". My answers are: "1) No, scarcely anything has been of value to me.  2) Yes, most has been essentially useless to me.  3) Yes, it will also probably be the case that my evalU8ions and those of students will indic8 the materials are mostly useless to me and them as well."
Xcellent Philip.
Thank you for that.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
No problem. Just trying to st8 the facts, sir.
lol
Facts acknowledged.
      Thank you so much.
I have wished I could answer differently. I hoped you'd have insights and wisdom, but you seem to exhibit almost none. Your 27 Axioms and 29 Pieces-of-Light are horrible. You can't even acknowledge my critiques and comments, which were elegantly and uniformly appended to them. I doubt you're even able to take any of it all that seriously. You seem oblivious to deficiencies, and self-assured that God is guiding you to truth and success, while the results of your efforts come off obtuse, obscure, and based on faith and misunderstandings of what could constitute perfection.
Good observation Pip.
Thank you for that.
üòä
You're welcome.
Other PCA you'd like to share ?
I think my PCA is wrapped up for the night. Anything else on yours?
Nothing I can think of at the moment.
Thank you for this great chat tonight.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
You're welcome too.
Are we on for October 30th ?
Yes. Let's plan on chatting again Friday night.
Xcellent.
Thank you.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You and Darjee have a one-durfull week please.
Thanks. I hope you have a gr8 week too.
Thank you.
I will if you will.

Good Evening Philip.
Hello Dad.
     And how was your week ?
Not sure.
Hmm.
That's an interesting comment.
Wish to expatiate on that some ?
I doubt that I can. I probably have little I can type to you tonight.
And why might that be ?
Too much seems uncertain.
Can you tell me one of the "too muches" ?
I don't know.
Well ok.    Maybe -- while you are incommunicado -- possibly I might chat with Darjee ?
How was your week Darjee ?
Maybe there's too much usage of words in most places I find, that haven't been defined clearly before usage.
Hmm.   That's (a bit) confusing.
Darjee doesn't read or type intentionally yet.
lol
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You make me smile.
And I thank you for that.
Did you recognize my "opening image" in this chat ?
No.
It was the front of the birthday card that you sent to me 2 years ago.
              I ‚ù§
 it.
It sits right above my desk.
And I see it many times a day -- every day of my life.
It also (like you) makes me smile.
üòä
Here is the inside (my fave part).
         I appreciate you Pip.
In what way?
How much time do you have ?
This may take several hours to answer that !!
Don't know. Probably not several hours.
     Well ok.   I'll just start with a few.
If you get tired -- we can continue later.
And for the rest of our lives too.
What do I appreciate about you ?
I like chatting with you.
You have an exquisite mind.
Quite polished.
And expanding constantly.
Not many other people that I know are in that same department.
I cherish that about you.
You are kind.
You are truthful.
You are multi-faceted.
You are interesting.
You are polite.
You appreciate quality.
I love your hugs.
I like your smile.
I like your style.
I hope we'll be friends
for a long long while.
Thanks for those. I'm also challenged to define "friendship" for now. We'll see.
Ah yes -- fri-end-ship.
Well -- the "ship" suffix is way of saying "together".
It is very similar to using a "co" or "con" prefix on a word.
Means "together".
The "fri" on the front of the word "friendship" --
comes from the French "fr√®re" --
and it means "brother".
Of course the "end" in "fri-end-ship" is a no-brainer.
It means "till the end" -- which implies "forever".
So -- a "friend" (fri-end) -- is a "brother-forever".
And the "friendship" is signifying that they "sail" (travel) together.
     It's a neat word.
I like it.
üòä
But --
not nearly as much as --
     I like you.
üòä
I suspect few (if any) things are forever.
Hmm.
Another curious comment.
As I was reviewing our "last weekend" chats -- I was seeing in your comments (there) that you tend to (strongly) lean toward a belief in "forever".
Was I wrong ?
I have serious doubts this week.
Why so ?
Not sure old view can work. Well I think I am getting pretty tired now. Can we please maybe try again next week?
Sure.
Thanks.
I can easily save my PCA for then.
You are welcome Philip.
Thank you for tonight.
Maybe short -- but I enjoy you --
short or tall.
I hope you have a gooder week -- this coming.
I shall look for you on Fri Nov 06 2020 - 2000 G / 1900 P.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks. Hope you have a good week too and maybe I'll look for you also, on Nov. 6th.
You're welcome.
Great.   Thank you Pip.

Hi Dad.
5'11-06-20 - 2005 Gtime / 1905 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
And how was your week ?
Good Evening to you too Dad.
My week has been challenging, but still pretty good too.
How was your week?
Pretty good too -- with some interesting challenges also.
Want to tell me about yours ?
Well the big issues for me were my landlord, Doug, trying to force me to move into another property that he manages. I've resisted that.
Hmm.
Go on please.
I've also gotten sober, staying off both THC (Marijuana) and Amphetamines. I'm planning to stay off them and Alcohol, etc. for good.
Wow !!
Probably just legal caffeine and nicotine for me ahead.
What brought you to that ?
Long story.
I've got time.
I have an appointment on Wednesday afternoon --
A lot of medit8ion and thought about cost / benefit analysis basically.
but -- for the next 3¬Ω days -- I'm all yours.
üòä
Nope -- make that 4¬Ω !!
I don't feel like getting into to much of the thinking right now. Maybe another time.
s/ to / too /;
That's ok.
I'm happy for you.
Are you happy about it ?
Thanks. Yes, I'm happy about it, and optimistic that it will lead to better opportunities to move back to SoCal hopefully next Summer. Care to tell me about what was challenging for your week?
Thank you for being so kind and patient with me last week. I was having an even more rough time back then. I appreC8 you.  üòä
I've been trying to clean up some programs on Tera.   Both DOS batch programs & QBASIC program.   I've been writing various programs for about 50¬Ω years now.
Cool.
Please feel free to e-mail me any code you write that you're proud of, or at least satisfied with. I'd like to see what you've written.
And -- not all of the ones I still want to use these days are able to be used on my current operating system without some necessary tweaking.
Octology on GitHub is usually where you can find much of my best.
Yep.   That is your pearl.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thanks Dad. I ‚ù§
you too.
You are an Xcellent programmer.
Thank you.
üòä
I'm so glad this past week went better than your previous one.
Me too.
Being patient with you (and others) gets easier -- the older I get.
It looks like I'm going to be switching some of my Supplementary insurance in January to a new AARP plan which should cover vision and dental, thankfully. It will be gr8 to get new glasses and my teeth cleaned after a decade of them both deterior8ing.
It comes from reflecting on all of my failures of the past 77 years -- and realizing that I was not always patient with myself.
And that was unkind of me -- to me.
So -- now that I have learned to be kinder (and more patient) with me -- it (naturally) follows that I (also) have more ability to be so with others.
And (of course) you are my fave.
üòä
AARP ?
But you are only 43¬Ω !!
I'm not sure what it stands for.
Just over a month away from 44 now.
Apparently old enough to qualify for better plans.
The "RP" is "Retired Persons".
Maybe American AssoC8ion?
Yep.   But my Gchat only accepts  ¬º  and  ¬Ω .   I doesn't have an ASCII char for 3/4.
Well -- if AARP will let you in at 43.9 -- I say:  good for them -- and good for you.
Teeth & eyes service is a good thing.
I applaud you.
Thanks.
You're welcome Pip.
So is anything on your PCA for tonight?
Just 2 -- but I'm in no hurry.
I just have 1 item for now. No hurry on my side either though.
I'm just enjoying you and your week right now.
Cool. Yeah, I am a bit tired, but would like to try to stay awake for a while longer to chat with you.
Me too.
I've been looking forward to chatting with you all week.
Me too.
With you.
Thinking about you a lot.
Nice.
Yes.   It is.
It is sweet to think about you Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
I ‚ù§
you too.
Thank you Pip.
You're so nice !!
Would it be okay if we take a 10 - 15 minute break from chatting so I could go smoke a cigar in my living room and return to chatting with you after that?
Sure.   Which one tonight ?
Cheyenne Sweet Mint.
lol
Ok.
E  n  j  o  y
Thanks. Yeah, I'll message you again when I'm back in my computer room and ready to chat further. Should be pretty soon.  üòä
See you in about 10 or 15.
5'11-06-20 - 2044 Gtime / 1944 Ptime
I'm back. I think I'm a bit too tired to keep chatting more tonight. Can we please plan to chat again further tomorrow night at 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime?
I ‚ù§
you.
Hope you have a good night and good Sabbath.
Sure.
The mint was the green wrapper -- yes ?
Thank you for this chat Pip.
You have a grreat evening (and Saturday) too please.
I shall look for you Sat Nov 07 2020 - 2000 G / 1900 P.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
G'night.

Good Evening Dad.
6'11-07-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
And how was your Shabbat ?
Restful. How was yours?
Restful is good.
Not sure.   Let me look.   BRB.
Ah yes.
I looked.
It was:
     researchful.
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Yes ?
You wanted to say ?
I watched a gr8 3-hour interview by Lex Fridman of Eric Weinstein at: HTTPS://YouTu.be/o2nG7-eXxko
It was about ?
Maybe you can get a chance to watch it too and will like it also. Lots of topics touched on.
The title is: "Eric Weinstein: On the Nature of Good and Evil, Genius and Madness | Lex Fridman Podcast #134"
Ah yes.
Eric -- the wise turtle.
Indeed.
Did you wish to make any comments on what he said ?
Well I don't seem to share the same pessimism as "Meta-Eric" and lean toward the willingness to try new things with slight hope of success like "Regular-Eric".
I am not sure I understand that.
Are you saying that you DO lean toward the willingness to try new things -- with a hope of success ?
Yes.
And Eric doesn't ?
"Meta-Eric" doesn't seem to.
Does he say why he doesn't ?
Not exactly. It's implied that he's too realistic or pragmatic and thus more pessimistic I think.
Ah so.
And your viewpoint on that matter ?
Trying new things is good, even if most attempts are overly ambitious and bound to fail.
Why are "most" attempts overly "A" and bound to "F" ?
Because they haven't been tried before.
Hmm.
But is not an attempt at anything -- always a success --
at learning something from it ?
Can be. It's usually a good way to look at attempts I think.
I do.
Even if an attempt at something -- results in a failure to achieve the desired goal -- I still learn something (from it) to assist me in making my next attempt:  more centered in on the target -- yes ?
Yes.
What is the concept of "Meta-Eric" ?   Why that name ?
He uses it. Watch and listen. I can't explain it better than I already have.
Ok.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You said last evening that you had 1 item on your PCA.
Did you wish to get into that now ?
Okay.
Okay.
You have my ears.
I have a plan to hand-craft a custom calendar for you for 2021 but I will need a printer (at least black-and-white with network interface, probably Hewlett Packard would be a good choice). Is there any chance you might be able to afford to purchase me one before December, since I can't afford to do so myself yet?
Do you have a model in mind ?
Not yet. Probably any HP with network-interface should suffice. Inkjet or Laser. Whatever.
I can do research and provide you specs if you'd like, probably via e-mail before next Friday.
Sounds like a good idea.
Thank you.
Cool. Will do. Thank you too!
You're welcome.   I look forward to your determination.
What is a printer "with network-interface" ?
One that can get it's own local IP-address via DHCP and then can be accessed via the LAN.
I don't think I understand that.
Not just hooked up via a parallel port or USB. Connects via Ethernet.
A printer like that does what -- that other printers do not do ?
Connects via Ethernet.
I'm sorry.   My ignorance is showing.
I don't think my printer is connected via Ethernet.
But it prints whatever I want it to.
Right. Most these days probably connect via USB. I'd rather have one on my network instead.
What am I not getting from it that I could otherwise have ?
Yes -- mine is USB connected.
It's easier for any machine on your Local-Area-Network to print to a centralized printer if it's connected via Ethernet instead of just USB off one of your machines.
I don't think I have a Local-Area-Network -- do I ?
Probably not. I always do though, to keep most of my machines connected through a Gigabit-Ethernet Switch, so I can easily login to any other machine over the network instead of requiring direct oper8ion.
I alloc8 static IP-addresses for each machine. I can show you my /etc/hosts file if you'd like to see my current mapping, for reference and example.
Are you saying that you are connected to your printer "wirelessly" via a LAN ?
Would you like me to paste it here for you?
Not exactly. Actually I prefer "wired" but "wireless" would probably be an option too.

You can see the local IP-addresses along the left side with them each followed by the machine interface name, then comments after the hash showing MAC and other details. It formats best in fixed-width font of course.
Thank you.
You're welcome. I've configured the DHCP server on my NetGear CableModem/Router to alloc8 these addresses for the detectable MAC's.
I'm sorry.   That ball went "out-of-the-park".   My mind cannot reach it.
But I still look forward to your email about the printer that you have your eye on.
Okay. I will probably research it and send you a link tomorrow (Sunday).
Anytime before next Friday is fine.
Thank you Pip.
You're welcome. Thank you too.
You are welcome also.

I love you too Dad.

Shall we talk about "The Election" ?
Okay. I didn't follow it. I don't have or watch regular TV. But go ahead and say whatever you'd like to about it.
I do not have (or watch) regular TV either.
Are you aware of the results ?
I caught a glimpse of a Twitter Tweet I think it was, on my phone, suggesting that Biden was leading in the vote counts. Didn't follow up on it though, so not sure if that's still the case.
Yes.   As of yesterday (Fri Nov 6 2020) morning -- there were still 6 states that were "in question" -- and at that time -- I made a projection (to myself).
Ah.
Interesting that the number might be exactly inverted like that.
Yes -- I thought so too.
And this morning (Sat Nov 7 2020) Pennsylvania got done their counting -- and their 20 gave Biden a total of 273 -- which was (finally) 3 more than he needed to win the new Presidency.
So -- I guess my question to you is:
             How do you feel about the outcome ?
I suspect that Trump remaining in office would have been slightly better for the upcoming 4 years than Biden getting in there, but maybe he'll be better than I'm guessing.
I guess I'm a little disappointed, but hopefully Biden will do a decent job and not screw anything up too badly.
lol
I hope so too.
üòä
Thank you.
The voter turnout was a record-breaker this year too.
I found that (also) to be interesting.
A turnout of greater than 60% has only happened 3 times before in our history.
In 1952, 1960, and 1968.
And the highest was in 1960  (62.8%) when John Kennedy was elected.
This year's turnout exceeded that -- with a 66.4% !!
Wow! Real close to 2/3rds.
The math of stuff always intrigues me.
Often for me too.
Yep.   Nearly 2/3.
As a kid -- I was never (really) into sports -- that is "to play them".   But I was (very) into the baseball stats of "how many games out of First-Place" each teams was -- day by day.
I loved (and still love) math.
Cool. Me too usually.
Well I'd like to take a smoke break out in my living room for about 15 minutes. Would that be okay? I should be back to chat more before 9pm Ptime / 10pm Gtime.
Sure.   What color this time ?
Red / Wild Cherry flavor.
Ah yes.
Red tonight.
Green last night.
Sounds like Christmas to me.
See you in about 15.
     E  n  j  o  y
I usually rot8 through my favorite 6 flavors: Pink / Strawberry, Red / Wild Cherry, Orange / Peach, Yellow / Vanilla, Green / Sweet Mint, and Blue / Xotic Berry.
Be back in a bit.  üòä
Ok Pip.
6'11-07-20 - 2143 Gtime / 2043 Ptime
I'm back.
Feel free to go ahead with your PCA items whenever you're ready.
Hello there "back".
Thank you.
üòä
üòä
Whoops.  I said only 3 times before this
year was voter-turnout above 60%.  Not
correct.  It was 4 times.  In 1964 also.
 
Sorry.
Ok -- thank you.
2 more items on my PCA for tonight.
One is weather.
Weather here has been quite nice the past 3 days (that I've remained sober for).
Xcellent Pip.
Just caffeine and nicotine for me now. I'm steering clear of the illegal stuff.
Good for you.
I'm so elated.
Yesterday was absolutely specTACular weather here too.
     A real "San Luis" day.
Zero clouds.
Bee-you-tiful blue.
And a high in the low 70s.
And today was a carbon copy too.
Temp (in the sun) today went up to 128¬∞.
In fact -- today was our 4th day with a high in the 70s.
And -- we are expecting 3 more days of the same too.
      I'm a happy camper.
Nice. I'm glad you're enjoying the weather so much.
Me too.   Thank you.
Ready for my other PCA ?
Yep.
Ok.     Here comes.
 
This past week was quite good.
 
The week before (which we had not gotten
a chance to chat about last weekend) was
even gooder.
 
I (SO) want to thank you for our Saturday
evening chat -- 2 weeks ago. 
You're welcome.
 
Truly a valuable one.  At least so very
much so for me.
 
I shall not comment on each facet of it
-- but one item was especially of great
satisfaction to me.
 
At 2335 Gtime (Sat Oct 24 2020) -- you
declined our offer to become FTR's Narrator. 
  
              And I thank you for that.
 
I must admit that for most of Sunday (the 25th)
-- there was a degree of sadness to it -- as
(ever since in late October of 2017 -- when
we first opened the idea to you) I thought
it would be a quadruple good development.
 
      #1  Good for you.
      #2  Good for our company.
      #3  Good for our students.
      #4  Good for our (yours & my) enjoyment of each other.
 
So.  At first -- there was a "sadness"
to your decision.  But that did not last.
 
I realized quite soon -- that you have been
leaning away from its doing -- for a long time
now -- and it was good to finally hear you say
it so clearly.
 
       I thank you so much.  :)
 
My Father and I chatted quite a bit over the
weekend about this.  And with each exchange
in our conversation -- the sadness just melted
away.
You're welcome. Yeah, I don't like the idea of putting my voice to "God" stuff and "Think and Grow Rich" things that I don't really believe in.
 
              ON NUMBER 2
 
      #2  Good for our company.
 
He reminded me about the fact that (#2) -- the
company did not "belong" to me.  And that I was
not the "boss" of it. 
 
And also: how (‚Ä¢) its structure (‚Ä¢) its rules
(‚Ä¢) its Scripts (‚Ä¢) its methods of operation
-- as well as (‚Ä¢) its personnel -- are not
decisions for me to be making.
 
Although He has appointed me to be the (visible)
"Front Man" -- He is still the real boss of the
operation.
 
I am not even an employee.  I am merely a volunteer
-- and this is not to imply "a power" -- but more
(actually) "a privilege".
 
And -- He went on to remind me of a (rather liberal)
handful of things that He has shared with me over
the years -- the prime of which was:
 
Piece of Light #5b: There are no accidents in my universe.
 
    This (of course) comes straight out of Romans 8:28 --
    which says: "And we know that all things work together
    for good, to them that love God, to them who are the
    called according to His purpose."
Just because you and your "Father" don't seem willing to admit there are accidents in "your" universe doesn't mean there aren't any.
 
    As I (this weekend) meditated on this verse (for probably
    the umpteenth time in the past 50 years) -- Sis focused
    me in on a number of key words -- and terms.
 
        know
        all things
        good
 
        called
        His purpose
 
Yes.  Again -- I was reminded that FTR was not a "purpose"
of mine.  It was (and is) a purpose of His.
 
This means that I do not have to manage it.  I do not have
to design it.  I do not have construct it.  I do not have
to control it.  And -- how it turns out -- or the good that
it does (or does not) produce in the lives of its students
-- is neither "up to me" -- nor shall I be held accountable
for what the FTR company may happen to fail to do.
 
That stuff is all: up to Him.  He is the CEO.  And even the
owner of the company does not get to advise Him on any part
of it either.
 
Hmm.  I said that was going to be about #2.
           But --- I guess it was also about #3.
 
                #2  Good for our company.
                #3  Good for our students.
 
He then moved on to NUMBER 4.
 
              #4  Good for our (yours & my) enjoyment of each other.
 
About which he said: 
 
    "Whether Philip is an active part of the FTR company
     or not -- need not be a factor at all in your continued
     enjoyment of each other.  The only 2 things that that
     is dependent on is:  (1) Do you want it to continue ?
     And:  (2) Does he want it to continue ?"
 
And -- at that -- I had to smile. 
       Of course -- He was right.
 
FTR has nothing to do with our
continued enjoyment of each other.
I do want us to continue to enjoy each other, when we can.
 
Bottom line:
 
       By mid-day on Sunday -- I was 99% fine with your
       decision to opt-out of the Narration Position.
Yeah, I too am glad FtR isn't essential for us to rel8 together.
 
    Why only 99% ?
 
Because -- we still need a narrator -- don't we ?
 
    Which (to my question) He responded:
 
       "Of course we do -- but My problem -- not yours."
 
Again -- I smiled. 
 
Sup to Him.  All of it.
 
Anyway.  I said all that -- to say this:
 
         Thank you Pip.
 
And now -- I (also) finally know why I purchased the
Shure SM58 Microphone (and its auxiliary equipment)
back in February of 2018 -- and began to put together
the packages and letter in March of 2020 -- but never
sent it to you.
You're welcome.
 
In my Father's time -- all is revealed to me.
 
I'm a happy camper.
  
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
 
(//)
Cool. Well I think I'm about ready to go to sleep.
Thanks for chatting again tonight.
I ‚ù§
you too.
I'll probably e-mail you about the printer tomorrow or certainly before next Friday, when we can hopefully chat again at our usual time.
Thank you for tonight's chat too Pip.
Thank you for your love.
You're welcome.
KB7LLS88
I hope you are Darjee have a good evening & a good week.
Thanks. We hope you do too.
Thank you.
And good luck on your continued sobriety also.
Thanks. I'll let you know how it goes.
Good.   Thank you.   Please do.
I shall look for you on Friday The 13th.
Yep. Hope to see you online then.
üòä
Good night.
6'11-07-20 - 2231 Gtime / 2131 Ptime
6'11-07-20 - 2233 Gtime / 2133 Ptime
Hi Dad. Sorry I am a bit l8 tonight. I fell asleep after Medication Observation. Maybe we'll need to just re-schedule for tomorrow or another evening instead?
KBDLLBDK
KBELCUTE
Hi Dad?
6'11-14-20 - 1330 Gtime / 1230 Ptime
All is fore-given.
How are you today? Sorry I was asleep last night, around our usual chat time.
Sorry be not.
All is perfect.
You are perfect.
The imperfect is part of "all" though.
There are no accidents in my universe.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I think there must remain accidents in your (and every possible) universe too.
Is my love an accident ?
That's precisely why there is such a word.
It might be.
This conversation is over !!
It is?
Why?
Call back when you agree with everything I've ever said.
Impossible. Of course it must be.
You've said things that are quite disagreeable before.
Everything you have ever said is perfect --
I disagree.
and absolutely correct.
This conversation is NOT over.
I've made at least typographical errors before. Those (and many other things) I've "said" were *not* perfect.
It shall continue forever.
I love chatting with you.
Maybe just a long time. Probably not forever.
Thanks Dad. I at least often like chatting with you too.
You are my favorite chattee on earth.
lol
üòä
There are probably better chattees than me... but maybe it's fortun8 for me that you're not acquainted with them yet.  üòâ
Oh yeah ?
So says you.
I say you are the best !!
And that settles it.
I have spoken.
üòä
          What ?
      No reply to that ?
Hmm.
I think I have a reply. I'm mulling it over.
Hmm back at you.
Take your time.
           I'm here.
I just had to rE-rEad all that we just typed to each other, just to remind myself of each exchange.
Ok.
Okay, so you say (or more precisely "type" and "write") that I am the "best". That may indeed settle it for you.
Fair enough.
However, as far as I'm concerned, I'd strongly expect that Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and at least Eric Weinstein also would be better chat partners than I in many cases and ways.
Your last 2 comments are fair also.
Maybe for you -- but not for me.
That's possible.
Even plausible.
I prefer you and Angie.
And Amanda & Katy.
Would you like me to try to turn on my camera and microphone during this chat, so that you could at least see me again somewhat and probably hear mostly my music (which is up quite loud right now, and hopefully you can enjoy hearing along with me), even if my voice is mostly drowned out by it?
Do you have any regular convers8ions with Angie, Amanda, or Katy?
I'm trying to initE8 the video portion of the chat.
I shall try again.
Gerry missed a call from you
Nov 14, 12:43 PM
Frequently -- yes.
Do you write them hand-written letters or chat with them online somehow? How frequently are such discussions between you and each of them?
Gerry missed a call from you
Nov 14, 12:45 PM
They have declined online recently.
I've tried to video-call you twice, but you seemed unable to pick-up either. Please let me know if you'd like me to try again. I'm willing to share video and audio with you again today, if you'd like to receive them.
But I hand-write.
Interesting. I'm glad you are able to maintain some contact with each of them. Hopefully it is sufficiently worthwhile and enriching for all parties.
I tried to "pickup" both of your video calls --
but didn't work.
Ah. Okay. Let me try again then.
Hmm. Maybe you can try to initE8 the call, if you can't answer my attempts to connect that way? Maybe I can accept your connection instead.
Gerry missed a call from you
Nov 14, 12:48 PM
The "answer" seemed to work -- but the "join" did not.
Same as on the first 2 tries.
It's not important.
Ah well. We tried 3 times.
      I remember what you look like.
üòä
Hopefully we can get it to work again another time.  üòä
      Ah ha.
A prayer.
I'm listening to a pretty huge Obsidia play-list on shuffle right now. The last song was: "Desolate" and now "Different" is playing, in case you want to search for them on YouTube and hear something like what I'm immersed in sonically.
I don't think a hope is exactly the same as, or even sufficiently akin to, a prayer.
I love the sound of your voice.
There may be some noteworthy similarities and overlap, but they certainly seem to me to contain critical distinctions.
It is music to my ears, my heart, and my mind.
                 I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Nice. Thanks Dad. I ‚ù§
you too. You should be able to hear some of my voice on my PipStuart YouTube channel whenever you wish to.  üòä
One of the Lessons in the PCA for Stanford is:
I intend to start 3 new YouTube channels over the next 3 months. Maybe you'll become able to hear and see even more of me if I get those rolling soon.
            Every Hope is a Prayer.
But my stus only get that one -- when they ask for it.
Please feel free to explain to me why there is no distinction to you between hopes and prayers then.
Send me your 3 URLs please -- when you get them up-and-running.
üòä
I will. Thank you for showing interest in them.
Always.
Everything about you --
            interests me.
You're welcome.
You said:
Please feel free to explain to me why there is no distinction to you between hopes and prayers then.
The first one should come up within the next month, probably under the new account title and channel name: "PedanticPip". The second will be a female persona I intend to develop called: "ClosedCaptionCratic". The third should come together somewhat next year as: "LLL" but I'll w8 to tell you what those stand for. She will be female too.
Did you want a response to that now ?
Sure.
LLL ?
What is an "LLL" ?
Also, please feel free to clarify if, even assuming all hopes *are* prayers, are any prayers then not also hopes, or are they entirely synonymous to you?
Good query Pip.
I think I (kinda) see 2 questions there.
My new channels will all follow certain conventions (probably). PP will be my first new one, which is basically very much like normal me, PipStuart. CCC will be my second new one, a female persona. Then LLL should also be female and come together next year. I then have plans to focus on those 3 for a while before starting new male channels under JJ, GG, II, and RR. We'll see about those, if the first 3 turn out decent.
#1 - Are all hopes prayers ?
#2 - are all prayers hopes ?
Right.
Yes, those are my questions.
Thank you.
And if so, why and how?
The simple (and fully accurate) answer to #1 is:    yes.
The answer to #2 is:    no -- and that one is (a bit) more complex.
May I interject another rel8d question here: If all hopes are prayers, what about hopes of people who don't believe or have faith in any God or gods?
Why would the hopes of unbelievers be prayers in any meaningful way?
Ok.   We'll address the hottest first.
Who would unbelievers hopes be prayers to?
Maybe "unbelievers" needs a trailing apostrophe for possessiveness.
The word "prayer" (for most people) gets defined as an activity which involves some (unprovable) "guy in the sky" (or something.
Right.
So why doesn't it for you?
That is not accurate (really).
What in particular is (really) inaccur8 about it?
However -- if the speaker -- and the listener -- both "hold" that to be a part of the definition of "prayer" -- then -- that's fine (for them).
P.S. Obsidia "Charged" is playing for me now, if you want to listen to it too. It's one of my top favorites.
But my definition of "prayer" is deeper -- far more encompassing.
Who is the "listener" though, if the "Guy in the sky" is un-provable though?
I shall continue -- but I must re-read here first.
Go ahead. Take your time. Address anything in any order you wish. I can usually keep up with whatever direction you feel is most deserving of taking our convers8ion in.
P.S. Now "Cobra" is playing, which is my absolute top favorite Obsidia track. The best!
There are plenty of little insertions (above in this chat so far) -- which we may (or may not) also get back to.
But I shall continue (for now) on the one open at the moment.
That's fine. Proceed however you wish.
The words "pray" and "prayer" are words which show up in The Scriptures quite frequently.
And -- in each case -- in order to have any idea of what the writer is attempting to communicate to us -- we need to be holding some sort of a definition for the word ("pray") -- within our mind.
I shall hone in on just one place for now.
Okay.
I Thes 5:17
https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5.htm
This is a tough verse for many people.
It says:
     Pray without ceasing.
And -- of course -- every one who has ever readd that verse --
has said to themself:
I'll follow that link and rEad it in a moment, but I'd like to say one thing first about this one place you've chosen to hone in on for now. I am not alone in considering Scriptures to be inferior to Dictionaries when it comes to canonical definition searches.
                   How is that even possible ?!
The Scripture are not easy to eat / digest / understand /comprehend.
Right. That's why Dictionaries are preferable when looking for definitions. That's my point!
One of the big problems in The Bible is that the things that the writers are sharing with us -- come in (about) 11 or 12 different categories.
And -- the writer switches from one category to another very frequently -- and nearly always -- without any warning at all.
Even more reason why the Bible sucks for definitions.
Let's take I Thes 5:16 and 17 and 18 -- as an example.
Verse 16 appears to be a suggestion.
Some people might call it a command.
It sounds like a command to me.
But -- there are no commands in The Bible.
Only suggestions.
Yet -- that is another lesson -- for another time.
It also sounds impossible. Nobody can seriously rejoice, pray, and give thanks all 3 at all times (always, constantly, continually, without ceasing).
I Thes 5:16 is a suggestion -- Rejoice evermore.
You're serious in saying Biblical "Commandments" are not commands?
Now -- let's look at I Thes 5:18.
Why say "always" when meaning "evermore"? The latter word was unavailable for some stupid reason?
Don't say "constantly" when you mean "usually".
I Thes 5:18 is also a suggestion -- Say "thank you" for every thing.
What about "always", "without ceasing", and "in all circumstances" makes any sense to interpret as mere suggestions for only some occasions?
It's as if you don't understand any of those words, or something.
They mean things.
So -- when people read verses 16 and 18 -- they believe that Paul is giving us a "to do" list.   I bunch of suggestions -- that (he believes) we should incorporate into our life.
And -- I'll go along with that idea --
          for starters.
Please rE-rEad my interjecting questions first.
If you can stop yourself, please don't go along with that idea just yet.
Address my queries.
And -- not only are 16 and 18 suggestions from Paul.   So are --
verses 15 and 19 and 20 and 21 and 22.
So naturally -- we tend to think that verse 17 is also a suggestion.
But --
I don't. Those words are not for suggestions.
You're in denial about the meanings of words.
every time we read it (as if it is a suggestion from Paul) -- our head screams:
          How is that possible ?!
I was no different.
My head did that too.
Was I (truly) asking that question -- of someone that I hoped would supply me with an answer ?
Or -- was I just (really) making a comment (sort of) "into-the-air" ?  
More or less (really) a complaint.
Well -- I can't remember for sure -- when -- and which.
But -- in the beginning -- yes -- it was (really) a complaint.
I was "miffed" at Paul -- for saying something -- that I perceived to be:
               not possible.
But that was only from my first reading of that verse -- when I was a child --
up until around the age of 30 --
when I seriously wanted an answer to this thing.
Is it possible to pray without ceasing.
My first thinkery was --
that Paul believed that it was.
You're still a child when it comes to reading, as far as I can tell.
This did not help me a whole lot.
        But -- it was a starting place.
Paul was not available.
          So -- I decided to ask breathing skinsuits -- which were available.
Did I get any good answers ?
I did not.
As a side question: When might you become able to learn how to read what I type in response to what you've written, rather than remaining on your single-minded train-of-thought? It's very hard to have an unresponsive "convers8ion" with someone who cannot also read and react and respond in-line.
Did I ask "everyday" people AND clergy people too ?
I did.
Did any give me a plausible answer ?
None.
I grew tired of this trek.
I decided to take my question to my EWO.
EWO?
This was somewhere in the mid-1970s -- I believe.
Eternal World O-something?
What's EWO again?
I don't use that initialism.
You're probably the only person who does.
I sat down with my pen & paper -- and asked My Father:
Is it possible to "pray without ceasing" ?
No.
It's not.
Eternal Wise One.
You assume God is Eternal, Wise, and One. Probably wrong on all 3.
To my question -- He said:  "yes".
I replied:
    So Paul was not "out to lunch" ?
He said:
Correct -- Paul was not out to lunch.
üòä
I thought about this a bit.
My next question came.
How (how) / how -- is it possible to:  pray without ceasing ?
He told me to answer that question -- for myself.
What the fuck does "How (how) / how" mean?
Yes -- there -- on my paper.
He wanted me to mull.
Which I did.
10 -- 20 -- 30
years.
Yes.   We talked about it -- again and again -- during those times.
But -- after each session -- he sent me off to mull some more.
Finally -- I came back to Him and suggested:
15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 -- those verses from Paul are suggesting:
       things to do -- things to incorporate into my life.
He said:  yes, they are.
And then I said:
        But -- I Thes 5:17 -- is NOT a command (a suggestion).
It is (instead) "a teaching" ?
He replied:   "Yes Gerry.   Now you've got it."
I Thes 5:17 is not telling us "something to do".
It is telling us something that IS.
Ok.
I'll take a break here.
Your turn Pip.
(//)
What are your definitions for the words: "command" and "suggestion"? You seem utterly insane to say "Make sure that...", "... always", "... without ceasing", "... in all circumstances", etc. are not "commands", but somehow merely suggestions or teachings. You hardly demonstr8 any capacity for using language logically.
Please go ahead and rE-rEad everything we've both written above, then reply to as many of my questions and comments as you're able to.
Ok.
Be back shortly.   I am re-reading -- as you have commanded me to do.
Fine. I will attempt to remain as p8ient as I can. RE-rEad as many times as you feel could be worthwhile, and mull whatever until you feel ready to respond to any aspect of it. I can attend to other things (like checking my bank balance and enjoying my Obsidia music with "Triad" playing now) until you seem ready to rE-eNgAge with our convers8ion again.
Ok.   I've done as you have instructed.
        I re-readd it all.
What would you like to discuss next ?
Please rE-rEad everything we've written today at least one more time through, then pick any of my above questions or comments to respond to. Take your pick.
Why continue on these ?  
You have been very clear.
Each answer I gave to your various questions to me -- was only rejected by you --or (in many cases) -- simply made you angry.  
I do not wish to upset you Pip.  
Can't we talk about something that is more pleasant ?
Just as a head's up, I plan to try to call Danny around 4PM my time (2PM Dtime / 1700 Gtime) and I'd like to be free to chat with him rel8ively undisrupted, so hopefully you and I can wrap up this chat session before then, and maybe re-convene around our usual time (1900 Ptime / 2000 Gtime) this evening if you're willing to continue any of our discussion around that time tonight?
Ah, okay.
Sure. I did get a bit angry a few times, but no big deal. I kinda like getting angry sometimes. I think it's good for the circul8ion!  üòâ
Any suggestions on more pleasant topics you'd like to delve into?
Sure.   A Danny chat sounds great.   Just let me know when.
üòä
I'm glad you circulation system is working.
             You're welcome.
I will let you know probably around 3:45PM my time when I'd like to suspend whatever we get into for a bit over the upcoming hour.
/you/   /your/
Me too. Circul8ion is usually gr8!  üòä
Thanks Dad. I love you too.
That's a beautiful image.
The "i" should probably be capitalized, but otherwise gr8.  üòâ
You're welcome.
üòä
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Are there any other items on your PCA for today, or would you like me to bring up one of the two I have for today / tonight?
I only have 2 -- but they can w8.
     You go first Pip.
Okay. Have you looked into the link I sent you for the HP P4015N networked LaserJet printer and considered whether you might be able to help me afford to purchase it? I would be much better off to have it, and I'd very much like to use it to develop a very custom hand-written artful calendar for you before New Year's Day (if possible).
Ah ha.
That was 1 of the items on MY  PCA.
 
Thank you for your email about the printer.
 
However -- my funding it for you this
year appears to be a "no-can-do".
 
So -- I guess your hope to create a
custom calendar for me will probably
have to wait until next year or so.
 
But -- I thank you for the idea.
I appreciate it -- and you Pip.
You're welcome. Thank you for seriously considering it. If you find yourself able to assist me in purchasing it (or another quite like it) at any time ahead, please let me know. I could probably put it to very good use A.S.A.P.. I appreC8 you too Dad.
Ok.   You shall be solving this soon.
                 I believe.
And  -- the other item on your PCA ?
Ah, yes. Is there any chance you already have, or could please help me to attain, the street addresses for the following people: Uncle Bruce, Uncle Tony, brother Tim, Uncle Kip, Uncle Pat, Uncle Dan, Uncle Billy, and Uncle Joey? I would gr8ly like to become capable of writing each of them letters and maybe eventually also becoming able to afford to send them a few small gifts.
I shall address your comment first.
And then -- your question.
You said:
I would gr8ly like to become capable of writing each of them letters and maybe eventually also becoming able to afford to send them a few small gifts.
 Excellent ideas Pip.
I believe they would very much appreciate hearing from you.
Now -- about the addresses for each of them --
You mentioned 8.
I believe I have 2 of them.
However -- I may be able to find the other 6.
     --  with your help.
Gr8! Thanks so much. What may I do to best help?
Please verify (or correct) names -- and give me a city & state on each.
Bruce Mathews
Tony Mathews
Kip Lennon
Pat Lennon
Bill Lennon
Joey Lennon
Do you have (also) current addresses for Mom & Angie ?
And Aunt Nina ?
Tony is "Anthony Ivan Mathews". Kip might be "Kippy" although that could just be his common nick-name. Pat is probably "Patrick". Billy is probably "William". Joey is probably "Joseph". All of their st8s are probably either California or Missouri.
I don't have addresses for Mom, Angie, or Aunt Nina. Those could prove useful too, if you might be able to help me acquire them as well.
Oh, and also Uncle Dan is "William Danforth Lennon".
Ok.   So I'll "up" the requested list to 11 -- not 8.
Is Nina still "Woodard" ?
Sounds good. Thanks. 11 then. Yes, I'm pretty sure Nina remains "Woodard".
You're welcome.
Was that your last PCA for today ?
Yes. I guess I can add one more though, if you want me to get into it somewhat?
Ok.   #12 is ?
No, not a 12th person to add to the previous list. A new PCA item somewhat rel8d to what I already mentioned back towards the start of our convers8ion today.
Ok.   I'll hold at 11.
As I described, I'm planning to start a new YouTube channel soon under the moniker "PedanticPip" who takes every word of online content so seriously and methodically that he lets almost no misspoken word or contradictory thought slide. I think this persona would be very much like my normal self. The majority of our chat today regarding hopes being prayers is probably quite a good example of how meticulous and determined I can be when challenging all sorts of language usages.
My second persona and channel I wish to stand up, hopefully during December, is ClosedCaptionCratic who is a female character that is somewhat like PP but she only focuses on the Artifical-Intelligence Auto-Gener8d CC subtitling that appears on most YouTube content. She will be rather laser-focused on just what is actually said and what discrepancies there are between what the AI gener8d text contains. Both of these should enable me to react to all sorts of interesting ongoing on-line material in hopefully sometimes poignant and profound ways.
I could really use the Shure microphone to help with these activities, if you could still afford to part with it and send it to me anytime soon.
So what do you think of these 2 initial ideas for channels? Any advice or recommend8ions?
No ideas yet -- nor advice -- nor recommendations.
I'll mull -- and look forward to seeing them.
About the microphone -- I'll have to decline on that one.
Okay. Well yeah, please mull and feel free to message me via chat or e-mail whenever you might have an idea or suggestion.
Our Narrator will need it.
But -- thank you for asking.
That's fine. I know you'll need it for your eventual FtR narr8or. Yeah.
I have one more PCA item that I could bring up now, or l8r.
Can we reconvene at 2000 G / 1900 P ?
My Son has just given me a large project to work on.
Hopefully. I will try to stay awake and re-connect with you then.
Cool. Thanks!  üòä
You're welcome.
Thank you for this chat -- and the assignment.
üòä
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You're welcome, for both.
I ‚ù§
you too Dad.
Have a great chat with Danny.
Look for you tonight.
Thanks. Have a gr8 afternoon and evening and I will look for you again probably at 7PM my time.
Thank you Pip.
Same to you.

Hi Dad.
6'11-14-20 - 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime
Hello Philip.
I enjoyed a very nice chat with Danny. He's doing pretty well. Has good projects and plans of his own.
He also was able to clone my GitHub Octology repository today, so I at least have one good off-site backup of the code and d8a now residing in California, just in case any calamity strikes me here at home in Oshkosh.
Glad to hear that.
Both.
I have made fairly good progress on your request.
Of the 11 -- I've got 7 so far.
Excellent! Thanks very much. I totally appreC8 your gr8 help with this.
Are we happy ?
Indeed.
üòä
Thank you Pip.
I ‚ù§
 you.
üòä
I ‚ù§
you too.
Thank you.
Along the way (in my research) found 2 pics too.
Cool.
Wanna see 'em ?
Yes please.
Ok.
See if you can identify this one:
Obviously Aunt Nina.
Give that man a cigar.
üòä
Heh. I *do* love a good cigar. Just had a nice Peach Cheyenne and am about to have a Vanilla one.
Good for you Pip.
Want to try for another one ?
Please.
Ok.   Who is this ?
Uncle Bruce looking pretty stern.
It 'tis.   It 'tis.  
Right on both counts.
He's not into the "grab-my-chin" position.
üòä
Hah. Yeah, I don't think "grab-my-chin" position would suit him so well.  üòâ
Right !!
Bruce is still in California.
Nina is in Colorado Springs -- a place I know well.
Cool.
Mom and I visited there in March of 1972 -- on our drive to Pennsylvania.
I hope to have the rest of your assigned project done before February.
Nice. Thanks. Anytime would be gr8.
How do I send you a data file through this chat thing ?
I don't know. Probably just attach it to an e-mail or copy and paste the text here instead.
            ok        we shall find a weigh
I'm going to test the "copy & paste" method here.

=======================================================
Yep, that works fine.
Good.
Will that serve your needs ?
     -- if I do it that way ?
It will.
Please proceed whenever you're ready to.
Ok.
Proceed to what ?
Proceed to copy and paste any others.
Naa.   I'll w8 till I have the whole doodad done.
Then you'll have it all -- in one single piece.
I can use any that you have already though. Please don't w8.
I'd rather connect with anyone possible, well before February.
Who would you like to write to first ?
My 7 Uncles, then probably also Cousin Gina, then maybe Aunt Nina, and then maybe Ange and Tim. Probably not Mom. I h8 her, and she h8s me.
Good.   I'll give you Mom's first.
               She does not hate you.
Oh yes she does.
It's mutual.
You guys just have a few issues to work through.
Way more than a few.
lol
             Ok.           I stand corrected.
I look forward to her incarcer8ion and hopefully also rapid deterior8ion and demise. I'll probably help bring about each, if I can. She's wicked. She's my primary enemy. I wish her the worst life could have to offer.
Well -- that's a mistake.
Which? What about it is a mistake?
But I don't know that you are ready for that lesson today.
Try me.
Ok.
The basic law is:
        That which I wish for others -- visits me first.
I don't believe that. Why should I?
It's certainly not anything like a "law".
You shouldn't.
              You are not up on that side of the mountain yet.
I'll take some time.
           It is not important tonight.
We can return to that subject in February.
üòä
I wish mostly good things for almost everyone. My moms and the Boxsteins probably all deserve prompt deaths though, as far as I can tell.
It might be important tonight. Why all this wanting to w8 until February for anything?
What is a "boxstein" ?
You misunderstood me.
I did not say that I will get your address list to you IN February.
I said:  BEFORE February.
The landlords in North Hollywood who stole almost all of my expensive belongings the first time I was forced into a mental hospital. They basically stole my ability to continue developing software professionally. They stole probably approxim8ly $20,000 worth of computer and game equipment from me. Their daughter tried to choke me. They are evil people.
Probably within the next 25 hours - in fact.
Ah ha.
So that is "a boxstein".
Gr8. Thanks... but you *did* just write "We can return to that subject in February" which would be *in* -- not *before*.
I'd like to meet them.
Yes.
You are correct.
On that -- I did say "in".
This is a poetic way of saying "later" --
I hope you only get to meet them at their funerals. I want justice and revenge for what they've done to me.
      and it further implies:    when you want it.
Okay. Well I want it now. How does wishing something for anyone visit me first as some kind of "law"?
Let us move away from the boxstein matter now please.
         It wrinkles your nose.
Okay. Let's move back to why wishing something for another should (according to you) become something which visits me first. Also, why is wishing my evil moms suffering and death a mistake?
Ok.
P.S. "Boxstein" is David and Edith's last name, which should probably be capitalized as a proper-noun.
I'll do the second one first.
Before her baby's birth -- a mother realizes that that baby is a separate being.
But -- it takes her a little while to fully fathom that.
After the child is delivered out into the air -- she knows the separateness to (truly) be so.
But -- the baby does not.
How do you know what a baby knows?
The child still holds on to the concept of their being one.
I doubt I did.
But -- in time -- even the child realizes that there is a disconnection -- in the visual realm.
I've never been "one" with my stupid ugly mom. From inception, I was my own man-in-the-making.
But -- the mother -- although she can mentally assent to their separation -- she never gets to the point that she becomes emotionally separated.
You don't know what points a mother never gets to.
Your Mother -- in Columbia -- lives with you every day.   And -- when you are in pain -- she also is in pain.
My mom and I have always been profoundly disconnected. She's evil and I almost never am.
You're wrong.
When you bring yourself to peace -- within you -- she will (also) finally also come to peace.
She has almost never felt pain when I have. You scarcely know either her or me.
Wrong again.
You do not have to wish suffering on Mom.
Your own lack of peace already does it.
When she is locked up for life, suffering, and hopefully soon dead... then I will come to some peace.
Please try to prove anything you're asserting here.
Physically -- your 2 bodies are separated.
But -- in truth -- it can never happen.
Now.
Maybe I don't "have to" wish suffering on Mom, but I still am pretty sure I retain good reasons for doing so. My own lack of peace does not already do it.
I did not read your comments -- as I was sharing what you had asked of me there.
You don't know truth.
But -- I shall go back now -- and do so.   Thank you for them.
Well then, as usual, please take your time to rE-rEad everything we've both written, then respond when you care to.
Ok.
Thank you.
Be back shortly.
I'm going to urin8. Be back in a couple minutes.
Back.
Good.
Welcome back
I have readd over all of your comments.
You have invited me to respond to any of them that I wish.
Yes.
This I cannot do.
You have clearly told me that everything I said was wrong.
And that settles it.
Everything I said was wrong.
Not everything.
(//)
You were right that I don't "have to" wish as I do. I do have reasons for doing so anyway.
If you think you know any of the things you asserted (without any substantial proof), please indic8 what else you know that contributes to the likelihood that any of your claims have merit.
None have merit.
If you just keep pronouncing things, as if they're adequ8 explan8ions or answers to questions, you're likely to continue to be met by me with incredulity and even some substantial hostility. You can't convince me of many things just by claiming them without evidence.
I'm loaded with opinions.
It's ok.
You asked for it.
I gave you what you asked for.
You rejected it.
It's ok with me.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Okay. Well thanks for your opinions then.
Not because you believe what I believe.
I love you because you are you.
If you back up your opinions with the reasons why you find them reasonable to hold, you'll get farther with me.
You are welcome for my opinions.
Thank you for the thanks for them.
üòä
So can you please provide me with the 7 addresses (of 11) you've found so far?
What's next young fellow ?
Nope.
Why not?
The file is a mess.
I don't care. I can clean messy files easily in seconds.
When I get the other 4 inserted -- I shall go in and clean it up -- and then send it to you.
Please send me the first 7 now (either via attachment to an e-mail, or copy and pasted in-line with this chat session here), and let me clean whatever I choose to for myself. Then feel free to send the remaining 4 whenever you find those too. I could use the majority of 7 almost right away.
Are you ready to mail a letter to someone now ?
Not exactly now, but l8r tonight or tomorrow I could be.
No mail is picked up for the next 35+ hours in Oshkosh.
I highly suspect I shall have your list done before 8 o'clock Monday morning.
Who is your first letter to ?
Okay. I can w8 until Monday then. That should be fine.
Are you available tomorrow night at 2000 G / 1900 P ?
I plan to write to my 7 Uncles first, and probably mail them all out at the same time, probably within the next few days (assuming I obtain all of their addresses first, but I may just send to a few of them, if I only have some subset to work with).
I should probably be available again tomorrow night at 2000 G / 1900 P.
Great.   Sounds like a plan.
I wanted to ask you about that.
Bruce, Tony, and Dan are your uncles.
I understand that.
But the other 4 are not.   Correct ?
You just address them as such -- as a matter of respect -- yes ?
Well yeah, technically Kippy, Pat, Billy, and Joey are not exactly my biological or by-marriage "Uncles" but they have each proven to be better Uncles to me than Tony or Bruce have been. Yes, I address them as such partially as a matter of respect, and partially due to them being better role-models and mentors than my official Uncles have been. I trust and respect the Lennons more and better than the Mathews men.
Yep.   I understand.   Thank you.
Do you have any of your letters partially drafted yet ?
Yes, I have some letters partially drafted already, but probably won't have any of my drafts ready to drop in the mail until Monday... so w8ing until then to gain their street addresses should work out just fine.
Do you wish to share any portions with me ?
Well I can summarize a common part of them being some explan8ions of my situ8ion and requests for assistance obtaining any working laptop and printer. If any of them have old (but still functional) laptops or printers laying around that they might be able to send me, I am intending to ask them to please do so. I could use both gr8ly.
Good.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
üòä
What else did you wish to get into tonight ?
2 things. First, I might start looking for full-time Perl development programming work again starting Monday also. Do you think I might be ready to take such a big step, or can you identify any reasons why attempting to do so might seem prem8ure to you?
Excellent question Pip.
Actually 2 questions.
How would you go about answering the first one ?
I'm inclined to answer the first myself as: "Probably." -- but I'd like your opinion on my potential readiness too, if you have one.
Well -- I've got 'em.
But -- I don't know if you want 'em.
Let me ask you a question first.
Puedo ?
I do want your opinion(s). Reasons would be good too, please? Yes, go ahead.
You have been fired from a programming job once -- yes ?
Many times.
Ok.
Good.
You remember the number ?
The number of times ?
No, I don't remember the number. I'm pretty sure I've been fired from at least several more than I've quit from though.
Ok.   Good.
Just pick one (in your mind) that you remember.
The reason your were given for your termination ?
/your/  /you/
"Sleeping on the job."
Good.
Thank you.
Pick another one please.
Reason for that one ?
I often would work all night, but they would ignore that when providing it as a reason for termin8ion.
"We're afraid of getting tax-audited because you've claimed exempt."
Good.
A 3rd one ?
"Arguing with the CFO."
Xcellent.
Now.
Monday -- the 16th of November -- you are going to get hired as a Perl programmer there in Oshkosh.
What do you expect to be fired for ?
I expect to start looking for work on Monday, November 16th of 2020. I expect to find a suitable job and accept a reasonable salary offer sometime in December or January, after having searched and applied for about a dozen available positions. I expect not to get fired from the job I land, expecting instead to quit after I can sustain my ongoing development of Octology and content production for my various YouTube channels through Patreon don8ions which become enough to afford my expenses without needing to retain classic employment.
Good.   Thank you.
You said:
I'd like your opinion on my potential readiness.
I have only one opinion.
If you are resolved (within yourself) to not do anything which might result in your getting terminated -- I believe your are ready.
What do you think ?
I hope I'm ready. I might be.
Well then -- now -- I have a second opinion.
You are not ready.
Why not?
The words "hope" and "might" are not a "yes".
So?
Those fuzzy words say that you have (yourself) said that you are not ready.
No. I don't know that I'm ready. I simply hope I am and might be. I'm honest. Not falsely confident that I'm ready for certain, when the matter is unknown and unknowable with completeness ahead of time.
Then -- if you cannot say that you are ready -- I cannot suggest that you are ready either.
I believe in what you say about yourself Philip.
I wouldn't have even asked you if I were already certain.
There would have been no point.
Good.
I am probably ready. I might be. I hope I am. I cannot say I am certainly ready.
So.   Go apply for the job.
Thanks. I probably will.
The "readiness" will get answered for itself.
Yeah.
Good for you.
Do it !!
Is anything on your PCA that you're ready to bring up now?
Yep.
You mentioned that you might like to write to Cousin Gina.
But you did not ask me for her address.
Yes.
Do you have hers ?
Correct. I probably have her correct address on the Christmas card she and her husband (Jose) sent me last year.
Ok.   I'll check it for you anyway.
Do you wish Cousin Danny's too ?
Thanks. The one I have for Gina and Jose is:  1339 Oswego St. Colorado Springs, Co 80904
No, thanks. I don't know Cousin Danny at all.
Ok.
We'll skip Cousin Danny.
The one you have for Gina is the one I have in my files for Aunt Nina.
I'll check on both of those for you too.
Are we done on this addresses assignment now ?
I think so, for now.
Ok then.
My PCA is back to zero.
We're on for tom at 1900 P ?
Yes. I'll look forward to chatting more tomorrow night hopefully.
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
Good.
Thank you for tonight.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
Thank you for tonight and today too.
You're welcome.
Thank you too.
Have a good evening -- you and Darjee.
We will. Hope you have a good evening too.
Thank you Pip.
Good night.

KBFLIGHT  (Sun Nov 15 18:16:17:29 -0600 2020)
Hi Dad. I know you're not online yet, but I've finished a pretty strong draft of the letter I wish to send to the 8 men I mentioned. This is my only PCA item for tonight, so I wanted to just paste it in here early, so that you can rEad it whenever you come online and hopefully can comment on, or critique it, in a little while. Here goes...
Dear Uncles :                                                  (Bruce, Tony, Dan,  Pat, Kippy, Billy, && Joey),                                                 
 and Brother:                                                  (                   Tim                       ),
 
How are you doing? Is there any chance you might be able to visit me in Oshkosh Wisconsin any time soon please?
 
Things remain pretty rough with me. I've been stuck in rather dire financial circumstances for the past decade.
 
The main reason I'm writing is in hopes of re-connecting with men I respect, and regard as worth looking up to.
 
I have no family left in this st8 and few friends. Most of my old ones have back-stabbed me and stolen from me.
 
This is a frigid and treacherous place, year-round. I'm usually very isol8d and neglected through my struggles.
 
Please reply whenever you can, and be again 4 me the role-models and honorable mentors you've been in the past.
 
Feel free to e-mail me at PipStuart@GMail.Com if replying via land-based snail-mail is less convenient for you.
 
I gr8ly appreC8 your time and attention. Just reuniting with any of you would probably do wonders 4 my outlook.
 
Thank you each immensely. I love and miss you much. Take and give care to yourselves and each other && be well.
 
Peace and Love,                          -Pip  (Philly-Phil, Delbert, Phil-pants, Flipper, Pepper, Peppy, etc.)
P.S. Both my Moms are wicked and terrible women!  When my Mom was my Disability Payee, she'd often give me only $30 each week to survive on.
  They were supposed to keep my money-collection safe (worth probably upward of $10,000). Instead, she denied my requests to return it to me
  and allowed it to be stolen when she moved to Columbia Missouri 5 years ago. She denies my needs because of my assumed "toxic masculinity"
  and addiction (in spite of the fact that I have remained almost entirely sober for years now, which she refuses to acknowledge and admit).
 
P.S. Additionally while my dream is to become able to afford another Fujitsu LifeBook someday (since my old 2008 LifeBook has died), I could
  gr8ly use any old laptop or printer you may have and no longer need which still works, since I have neither one (&& serious need of both).
  I would be quite glad to try to save up any money I could to cover expenses for shipping either to me, or to compens8 you for their costs.
  Thanks again, very much. I have an overwhelming number of growing needs, but I don't want to be seen as much of a burden to you either. ‚ù§
P.S. If you're interested in what I've been up to, please check out my Octology project on GitHub.Com and my following Google Photos albums:
  https://Photos.App.Goo.gl/COeDDDS7UBwgjW9k2                     --                    --                     --                 "PipzFvr8"
  https://Photos.App.Goo.gl/E7wUCrfsuwSLLRif2                     --                    --                     --                 "PipzDarj"
  https://Photos.App.Goo.gl/6VaCvjSvhSjM7Dzw5                     --                    --                     --                 "PipzDfns"
 
P.S. Please save the included MicroSD 16GB memory-card in a safe dry place, and feel free to look into or copy any files you can find on it.
  I very much want to distribute off-site backups of my valuable code and d8a, just in case catastrophe strikes my apartment (or computers).
  If you ever might wish to similarly send me copies of your own valuable files in a similar fashion, I would be glad to keep them all safe.
  I consider none of my included files to need to be kept priv8 or secret from any of you. I trust you all implicitly and explicitly. Thanx!
That's it! What I've written so far. I think it's probably very close to ready to be hand-written out on my graph-paper and mailed to the 8 of them (once I receive the MicroSD cards and obtain their street addresses, hopefully within the next week or 2).
Are you reading it all now?
I ordered a 10-pack of MicroSD cards from NewEgg yesterday, which should hopefully arrive soon. I've set aside very close to 16GB of my most precious files to copy onto each of them. I probably want to send 8 to them, 1 to Danny, and 1 to you... so that I can know there are identical copies of all of it distributed across the country (in probably at least 3 st8s).
You seem to have been online for over half-an-hour now, but have written nothing. It should have been plenty of time to read my whole letter at least twice. Are you busy doing something else, and want to just chat again another night, or what?
0'11-15-20 - 2037 Gtime / 1937 Ptime
Good Evening Philip.
Hello.
Yes -- I came onto Gchat at 2000 G / 1900 P to look for you.
I did you see you -- but I found what had sent to me at what appeared to be 1921 G / 1821 P.
I readd that and waited to see if you were going to arrive.
I was here the whole time.
I don't know how you know when I am online -- but I don't know how to know that about you.
It is not important.
So message.
You are there now.
It *is* important.
I had gone to the kitchen for a time -- and when I got back -- found your other message sent at 2016 G / 1916 P.
So -- we're up to date now.
I see you say you were here the whole time.
So -- my bad.
Sorry.
Please forgive me.
I'll try to.
lol
Thanks.
üòä
Well -- if it doesn't work -- it's perfect.
I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
You think you do. Maybe someday you'll learn how to.
No human is perfect. Part of the human condition is imperfection.
I've readd both of your pre-messages for this evening.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Any thoughts?
A few.
Of your 8 intended addressees -- how many of the 8 have talked to (or written to) you within the past year ?
1. Tim replied to an e-mail saying he doesn't h8 me. That's about it.
Hooray.
We knew that about him -- didn't we ?
No. He acts like he does, despite what he wrote.
Do I act like I hate you Pip ?
Yes.
You claim you don't (like Tim did), but you both know almost nothing about me and show little care or concern for what love means to me, or how to show it in any way that would be meaningful to me.
I suppose now might be a good time for you to share with me -- how you wish to be loved.
Would you like to do that now ?
Okay. Stop sending me Kauai calendars. I h8 that place. I h8 my Moms. Dottie has had a large Kauai sticker on her car for many years. Both she and you have visited that place. I never have been there, and probably will never go. I h8 her. I h8 Kauai. Your common love for the supposedly "beautiful" vac8ion place makes me h8 you too... even though I try to fight it.
A much better way to show me you love me would be to buy me calendars of the Philadelphia Flyers, Yamaha motorcycles, or cute black cats. You and Mom love Kauai. I h8 it.
That sounds pretty easy.
So -- if I stop sending you Kauai calendars -- you will know that I love you ?
It's one big and easy way to do a much better job of showing me love. Take me and my likes into account. Yes, it could be a rel8ively easy start.
No.
It's a start.
Start learning about me. Stop saying I'm perfect. I am not.
Must I stop loving your Mother ?
I don't know. Maybe.
Sorry.
No can do.
Never have.
And never will.
She's evil. She's probably a demon who you have been tricked into thinking is your "Father".
She probably made you mute.
She lied about you in court and to your kids.
You are probably deceived into thinking the voice in your head of your "Father" is this "Eternal Wise One", but it's probably just her. She h8s men. She h8s both of us. She destroys civiliz8ion. She has tried to kill me and has made me suffer many times throughout my entire life. She's the "Evil Wicked Oaf". You would probably do well to stop loving her.
She was / is / and probably always will remain my most favorite person and best friend on earth.
To stop loving Dot would be equivalent to having stopped being me.
Had I not loved her -- you would not be breathing.
Are you angry about breathing ?
Are you fucking retarded?!
I certainly am.
Damn str8!
So -- do I understand this now ?
You hate Mom.
You hate me.
And you hate Tim.
I h8 Mom. I try not to h8 you. I don't know if I h8 Tim.
I don't have a problem with any of that.
I love you Pip.
As I said, you think you do. You claim to.
You scarcely take me into account though. Your words are mostly hollow.
You seem  to forget -- you told me how to love you -- and I did it.
Yet you still do not believe that I love you.
Wrong.
You said not to send you anymore Kauai calendars.
rE-rEad everything we've just typed each other.
And I haven't -- in the past 45 minutes !!
I said that would only be a start.
Can't you fucking rEad?
Does that not show my love for you ?
No! It doesn't.
You're so dense.
Yes I am.
Help me please.
I try to.
#1 - stop the calendars.
What is #2 please ?
#0 - Learn about who Pip really is. If you stubbornly continue to know almost nothing about me, you cannot love me meaningfully.
#1 - Stop Kauai calendars and start sending calendars which take into account what Pip likes.
Ok.   Who is Pip really ?
You don't even care.
I tell you how many times that I'm not perfect.
You insist that I am.
Oh.   Ok.   I stand corrected.
Do not help me to know who you really are -- because I do not care to know.
Is that better ?
Is what better than what?
What are you asking?
Would you feel more loved by me -- if I lied to you -- than telling you my truths ?
No.
Good.
I see you as perfect.
You're blind then.
This is my truth.
It's not true.
I am not perfect.
You don't see me.
The fact that you do not see you as perfect if (totally) ok with me.
But -- it does not change what I see in you.
The fact that you see me as perfect is totally not okay with me.
I know that.
It means you cannot see me.
I'm ok with that.
I'm not. It's a sign that you're blind, deaf, dumb, and mute.
You are correct -- I do not see within you -- what you see within you.
We disagree on that.
You idealize me. You don't care who the real me is.
And -- I'm ok with that disagreement.
You being "ok" with our disagreement about perfection is a sign that you indeed h8 me more than know and love me. A vivid sign!
Tell me this please -- who (besides you) sees the real you Pip ?
Danny, Beppu-san, Duncan, Torrey, Mike, Tone, Amichai, Nissim... for starters.
Xcellent !!
Probably my 7 Uncles have seen the real me in the past and may become capable of doing so again hopefully soon.
Do you chat with Danny, Beppu-san, Duncan, Torrey, Mike, Tone, Amichai, and Nissim on a regular basis ?
Sometimes we stay in touch more closely than other times... but generally: "Yes, we chat on a somewhat regular (even though rather sporadic) basis."
Good.   Sounds like a very loving thing to do.
It can be.
I hope you eventually become capable of rE-rEading everything we've typed to each other tonight, a few times over, and ponder what it all means for both of us. I expect little of it can get through your dense mind, but I hold hope that in time, some of it may be absorbed and understood and then acted upon more lovingly.
I hope so too.
üòä
Please send me as many addresses as you can, as soon as you're able and willing to.
I always re-read our chats -- and frequently multiple times.
Good. I often do rE-rEad our chats too.
I spent about another 5 hours today on the addresses assignment you gave me.
It is not going as smoothly as I had hoped -- but I expect to --
have it completed soon.
Please just provide me with as many addresses as you can, as soon as you can. I probably won't need them before next Friday night though (Nov. 20th of 2020), since I still need to hand-write 8 copies of my draft letter above and will be w8ing for the memory-cards to be delivered before I can copy my files onto each of them and prepare it all to travel through the USPS.
Thanks for working on it. You may be helping me significantly by doing so.
I'm (now) shooting for a completion time of Mon Nov 16 2020 at 2000 G / 1900 P.
I hope it helps you.
I love you Pip.
You're welcome.
It probably will help me. I try to love you, Dad... even when I feel mostly loveless. Did you have comments about my draft letter?
Yes.
A few I have shared.
But -- I also wanted to say that:  it seems "busy".
Had you intended it to be so ?
I don't think you've shared a single comment about my draft letter yet.
You asked one tangential question about whether any of the 8 have communic8d with me within the past year.
I might also ask (along the same lines) -- what was your main (central) reason for the letter ?
What about it seems "busy"?
What do you mean?
My central reason is explained repeatedly in there. I want to re-connect with men I respect.
Well -- skip the "busy" comment then.
And your reason (or reasons) for wanting to re-connect ?
Do you address that in the letter ?
What about the letter seems so unclear or ambiguous to you?
Yes. I addressed that.
Ok.
Thank you.
You have answered my questions.
You're welcome.
I'm needing to take a smoke-break and a walk around the block. I should be back inside maybe a little after 9PM Ptime here, and will check to see if you've made any more comments during the time I was away. Feel free to type whatever you wish to discuss once I've returned... or we can just plan to try to continue chatting more tomorrow (Monday) evening if you'd prefer that. Either way should be fine with me.
Did you have anything else you wanted to discuss this evening ?
No.
Let's re-convene tomorrow night. Thanks for chatting tonight.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Look for you tomorrow night.
KBFLL8rD  (Sun Nov 15 21:08:53:13 -0600 2020)
Have a good evening.
I love you Pip.
You too. Bye.
Bye.

Hi Dad.
1'11-16-20 - 2015 Gtime / 1915 Ptime
Hello Philip.
How are you this evening ?
Kinda tired, but ready to chat for a while. Just woke up from about an hour of sleep after Medic8ion Observ8ion.
Good for you.
Usually I can open my "chat window" before you call.
But tonight -- no.
Hmm. Maybe it can be fickle sometimes.
I get a half of a message that Hangouts is going to be "turned off soon" -- and there is no way to read the whole message -- and no way to open this chat window.
So -- I'm glad you called.   That made it open without any doing from me.
Nice. Glad it can work out.
I went online to see what I could find out about what Google is doing with the Hangouts -- and had just begun to find some information on it when you called.
So -- I shall get back into that research later.
Okay. Please feel free to message me with what you find. I'm interested in what Google is doing with HangOuts too.
I just might do that.
But -- as long as you can reach me -- that's what is important to me.
Most of the "addresses project" thing is done.
I spent a pile of work on it today -- and it has gone well.
I'm having problems with formatting -- but I'll work those out soon -- I hope.
When do you expect your SDs to arrive ?
Gr8! Thanks. I should probably need them (just for those 8 men) on Friday maybe (but any of them anytime sooner would still be welcome).
I expect the MicroSD's to arrive hopefully Wednesday or Thursday.
Well ok.
I only see a couple more hours needed before I have this address-thing ready to get to you.
Cool.
So -- you should be in good shape.
üòä
üòä
Sorry for the double-face.
My friend, Jer, said he can probably help me to make color copies of my hand-written letter, so I won't have to hand-write all 8 (or 9 to send you one too) copies.
The first one didn't look like it worked.
That'll be nice.
Yeah. He also invited me to spend ThanksGiving with his family. Very nice of him.
Just don't make it look like a "mass" letter.
Turkey and all ?
I've revised the draft somewhat. It should be less "busy" now. Do you want to see what the text is now?
He's there in Oshkosh ?
Yes, turkey and all. He lives in Appleton. He was my old upstairs neighbor off Honey Lou.
Do you consider it "finished" now ?
Yes, it is probably "finished" now.
That's nice.
Your car is running ?
I've written the main message out by hand on front and back of one sheet of graph-paper. I just have 2 P.S. sections now (culled down from 4 last night).
Ok then.   If you like it as it now is -- yes I'd love to look it over.
Yes, my car is running.
Okay. I will paste it here.
                 I will w8.
The first part is almost identical to what I had last night, just with one line taken out. Here goes...
Dear Uncles :                                                  (Bruce, Tony, Dan,  Pat, Kippy, Billy, && Joey),
 and Brother:                                                  (                   Tim                       ),

How are you doing? Is there any chance you might be able to visit me in Oshkosh Wisconsin any time soon please?

Things remain pretty rough with me. I've been stuck in rather dire financial circumstances for the past decade.

The main reason I'm writing is in hopes of re-connecting with men I respect, and regard as worth looking up to.

I have no family left in this st8 and few friends. Most of my old ones have back-stabbed me and stolen from me.

Please reply whenever you can, and be again 4 me the role-models and honorable mentors you've been in the past.

Feel free to e-mail me at PipStuart@GMail.Com if replying via land-based snail-mail is less convenient for you.

I gr8ly appreC8 your time and attention. Just reuniting with any of you would probably do wonders 4 my outlook.

Thank you each immensely. I love and miss you much. Take and give care to yourselves and each other && be well.

Peace and Love,                          -Pip  (Philly-Phil, Delbert, Phil-pants, Flipper, Pepper, Peppy, etc.)

P.S. Both my Moms are wicked and terrible women! When Mom was my SSDI Disability Payee, she'd often give me only $30 per week to survive on.
  They were supposed to keep my money-collection safe (worth probably upward of $10,000). Instead, she denied my requests to return it to me
  and allowed it to be stolen when she moved to Columbia Missouri 5 years ago. She denies my needs because of my assumed "toxic masculinity"
  and addiction (in spite of the fact that I have remained almost entirely sober for years now, which she refuses to acknowledge and admit).

P.S. If you're interested in what I've been up to, please check out my Octology project on GitHub.Com and my following Google Photos albums:
  PipzFvr8 : HTTPS://Photos.App.Goo.gl/COeDDDS7UBwgjW9k2 ;  Please save the included MicroSD 16GB memory-card in a safe dry place. Feel free
  PipzDarj : HTTPS://Photos.App.Goo.gl/E7wUCrfsuwSLLRif2 ;    2 read, use, or copy any files you find on it which might be useful 2 you too.
  PipzDfns : HTTPS://Photos.App.Goo.gl/6VaCvjSvhSjM7Dzw5 ;  Also, if U have an old working printer around, I'll pay 2 ship it here. Thnx! ‚ù§
That's it for now.
I still have to write out the 2 P.S. sections on a sepR8 sheet of paper before I will be taking them to Jer's to get color copies made.
Then I will aw8 the MicroSD's arrival to get loaded with my top 16GB of files to include in letters to those 8 men and 1 copy to you too.
Sorry for the delay.
I had to reload gmail.
And then -- I had to figure out how to get the chat box open.
It's fine. I know it happens sometimes. I try to remain p8ient.
But I did it.
I'm going to read what you sent now.
BBS.
Any comments on the upd8d message text? Ah, okay.
Just for your reference, BBS normally refers to old dial-up Bulletin-Board-Systems, and is rarely used as you do to indic8 "Be Back Shortly". For this, usually "BBiaB" for "Be Back in a Bit" or "AFK" for "Away From Keyboard" is much more typically (and less ambiguously) used in online chatting.
How about HFC ?
Does that work ?
I don't know what HFC means.
Hanging From Ceiling
Sounds kinky!  üòâ
(flying around)
Ok.   Well.   I'm back.
I was going to guess "Have Fun Coding!"  üòä
Okay. Welcome back.
            And -- in answer to your question:
               Nope.   No comments.
Does it at least seem less "busy" now?
If you're happy with it -- that's all that's really important.
If you'll remember -- I had decided to rescind that "busy" comment.
I have hopes that at least 1 of the 8 recipients will be prompted to reply to me in a return letter of e-mail. That will make the whole effort worthwhile for me.
Well -- I hope that you get 9 replies.
        That's what I hope.
I didn't quite know what you meant by "busy", but suspected that whatever you meant by it, maybe it would seem less applicable now that I took out one of the lines from the main message and cut down the old 4 P.S. sections down to just 2 now.
Yeah, you'll count as a 9th recipient. I intend to send you an extra special page that the other 8 will not receive.
No -- that's not what I was implying.
Oops. I meant "return letter *or* e-mail" ... not "of".
My 9 meant that all 8 reply once -- and at least someone becomes a regular with you.
I caught that.
I knew you meant "or".
But thank you for mentioning it.
Ah. Nice. Yeah, I totally hope someone becomes a regular with me too. Thank you. Glad you understood.
I strongly hope it's either Uncle Bruce Mathews or Kip, Pat, Billy, or Joey Lennon. I have less confidence that Tony, Dan, or Tim will be able to take my side against Mom, so I'm less interested in their opinions and likely responses.
Sides.
Hmm.
Yeah. What do you think about taking such sides? With what you know and have read that I've written about things so far, would you consider yourself to be more on my side, or hers?
Is that like a choice between broccoli or mashed potatoes ?
Yes, something like that.
Sides (in this kind of context) sounds like a war is brewing.
I grew up in the 50s and 60s.
Indeed, one probably is.
     And our mantra was:             Make love -- not war.
Rather challenging mantra to interpret though.
When nations go to war -- I go to Canada.
I love you Pip.
Having sexual intercourse doesn't seem like a direct or simple altern8ive to waging war.
I am here for you.
Thanks Dad. I try to love you too.
I will keep trying to be here for you too.
I am not interested in wars.
I do think something like at least an ideological (if not also somewhat monetary and maybe physical) war is brewing between my Mom and I.
When you wish to talk about things which distress you -- I am here.
But then -- you know that.
üòä
I love your Mother.
Thanks. I appreC8 that you are here for me, at least via chat almost every week (or even more often than just each Friday evening).
I know you do.
I think I made that quite clear.
But -- I also love you Pip.
I had a question that maybe I could ask you now.
And not one more than the other.
You said that you have never stopped loving my Mom and that you never will.
You wish to chat.
Mom does not wish to chat.
I'm fine with that.
So -- by Mom not wishing to chat with me -- I get to give more of my time to you.
I wondered today: If my Mom hypothetically began entering Elementary Schools across the n8ion and slaughtering classrooms full of young rel8ively innocent children, might you become capable of no longer loving her, were she to do that?
Everything is a win.
Nice. I'm glad you have so much time to chat with me.
Mom doesn't wish to chat with me either.
She h8s men, and seems to wish a quick death upon all of us, so that she can attempt to bring about her simple-minded vision for a Feminist Socialist Utopia of some sort.
Did you (really) want an answer to your question ?
Yes, please.
Or -- was it rhetorical ?
Oh.
Ok.
I shall answer it.
The short answer is -- if she did such a thing -- I would love her more.
Hmm. Unexpected answer.
Do you not think if she did that -- she would be crying out for help ?
Of course she would.
Maybe she would be, but that doesn't mean she'd be deserving of more love.
Crying out for help in ways that massacre and commit genocide probably are not deserving of even more love than had cries out for help been made in other more ethical ways.
At least as I see things, for now.
And -- I may not applaud everything that my acquaintances  do.   But that does not ever stop my love for them.
I see.  That makes sense, from your perspective.
This goes for Mom.   This goes for you.   This goes for Katy.   This even goes for my own self.
So then, is there any hypothetical scenario you *can* imagine which might cause you to stop loving my Mom?
I'm quite curious what such a scenario might be, no matter how far-fetched.
I do not applaud everything that I do -- but if I were to stop loving me because of one of those things -- I would certainly be casting my self into some really deep doodoo !!
Hmm. I can understand that, somewhat.
The answer to that last question is:   of course not.
If I could stop loving -- I would have had to have stopped being who I am.
Do you love S8n ("Satan")? What if my Mom is the living embodiment of S8n? Would you still love her then?
Hmm. Maybe in some sense, that would be true.
I do not believe in a satan.
But changing and growing means in some senses that you need to stop being who you are, in order to become different and hopefully better.
Ah. Do you believe in evil beings?
So -- I cannot (therefore) believe that a person is its embodiment.
Okay. Do you believe people can be or become fundamentally evil?
Do I believe in evil beings ?
Yes.
No.   I believe that I (and others) have done evil things.
I see.
But that does not make me (or them) an evil being.
An (occasional) evil doier -- yes.
An evil being -- no.
What stops an "occasional" evil-doer from doing so much more evil than good that they ought to be best understood as fundamentally evil themselves, rather than merely capable of just doing some slight evil sometimes?
An interesting question.
Would you share your answer to it please ?
For example, do you think Adolf Hitler only occasionally did evil?
My answer is: "Little."
I think there are such things as fundamentally evil beings.
Beings that do so much more evil than good, that they are best understood as actually evil themselves.
Evil beings. Rare, but they exist. I believe both my Moms are such beings.
Ok.   I guess it's my turn.
I'll start with the question about Mr. Hitler.
Okay.
Adolf had many excellent qualities within his person.   Admirable.   Many characteristics that few others have bothered to develop within themselves.   And many that The Bible (clearly) tells us to cultivate.   ¬∂   However.   Somewhere along the way -- he also started to chew on some nasty ideas.   These are notions that you would call "evil" -- and I would agree with you.   ¬∂   But these evil notions (somehow) got locked into his mind.   And he went down that road with a vengeance.   ¬∂   Were any one of those evil notions of his any worse than feelings I (also) have found within myself ?   No.   The only difference between us is that I (for some reason) was able to see that evil within me -- and I chose to turn away from it. 
Hmm. Okay. Good answer, I guess.
Your Mother will not always be as she is today.
She is on her path.
I am on mine.
You are on yours.
And I know where we all end up.
So -- it is very easy for me to love all 3 of us.
üòä
Where do we all end up, and how do you know that?
I see 2 questions.
Do I get to pick which one I answer first ?
Sure.
Good.
Thank you.
Where do we all end up ?
     Ooo  ooo  ooo.
             Such an easy one.
                         We all end up           hugging            forever       !!
I won't.
That's up to you Pip.
Even assuming I live forever, I certainly won't spend it hugging you or her or both of you or anyone else and doing nothing but.
But -- I'll hug you -- if you will permit it.
And I have no say over what you wish.
If you and I live forever, and you don't get in my way too much, I may permit you to essentially hug me forever.
Or anyone else -- either.
So how could you know that you will spend forever hugging Mom and me? How could that be easy to know?
I see 2 more questions.
The first is basically the 2nd question from before.
I'm going for the second one first.
How could that be easy to know ?
       It is not.            It is very difficult to come to such a knowledge !!
I think I've already proven that you don't actually *know* what we all 3 end up doing though. You said we all end up hugging each other forever. I said, I won't hug forever, even assuming I *do* live forever. You then acknowledged that and said you have no say over whatever I wish. So obviously you didn't *know* where I would end up, if you assumed I would simply hug you and her forever, which I won't do.
Excellent comments Pip.
If I live even close to forever, I have many far more important things to do than merely hug.
                  ( applause goes here )
You and she may hug essentially forever though. Maybe you can do it in Kauai together quite happily. Maybe you deserve each other, in some lengthy dur8ion approaching forever.
I don't know.
Thanks.
( bow goes here )
You're welcome Pip.
üòâ
Thank you for asking.
You're welcome.
          Of course -- you know -- that when you bow -- we just applaud even more fervently.
üòä
What about a curtsie?  üòâ
I'm still working on perfecting mine.
I'll show it to you when I think I've got it nailed.
Sounds gr8! I look forward to seeing it, whenever you think you're ready.  üòä
Good.
Although it is not important -- and I (fully) knew what you meant -- there are only 2 standard (allowable) sppelings for that dance movement -- curtsey & curtsy.
Thanks. I guessed that, after the auto-spelling suggested I had it wrong. I was close though.
Yep.
I suspect "curtsie" is an even cuter, more feminine way of spelling it, and ought to be deserving of inclusion in the set of accepted spellings.
At the risk of being scolded for saying so -- you (Pip) were not only "close enuff" -- you were perfect !!
Thanks. I can be perfect here and there, once in a while. Just not all the time. I have to go pee. BBiaB.
lol
P                             away.
           I'll w8.
Thanks. I'm back.
Good to see your back Pip.
I've been drinking a lot of coffee and limeade today. Now I've started on some iced tea. I love drinks even more than food most of the time.
you're
I love limeade too.
Where do you find it ?
I end up making my own.
Salv8ion Army gets it don8d to their food pantry sometimes, and they then can give it to me. Tasty!
Hmm.
No -- not "you're" -- I said it the way I wanted it to go.
üòä
Ah. Okay then.
Well in that case, I said: "I'm back." meaning that's what you should call me now, not "Pip". Just kidding.  üòâ
Hello Back.
Have we run outta stuff to say ?
This was a very pleasant chat Pip.
Maybe I have for now. Is there anything else you'd like to chat about tonight?
Thank you so mush.
Yes, I agree. Thank you for a very nice chat tonight.
         I always have room for these.
Much rooms.
Cute.  üòä
No -- I'd kinda like to go (try to) finish the assignment you gave me.
Okay.
Puedo ?
Can we do this again tom at 2000 G / 1900 P ?
Well please feel free to do your thing and message me whenever you have as many addresses as you've been able to find... or yeah, let's just plan to chat again tomorrow (Tuesday, Nov. 17th) night at 2000 Gtime / 1900 Ptime. Sounds good.
Good.
          Sounds like a plan.
Have a good night and day before then.
                       I ‚ù§
 you Pip.
I ‚ù§
you Dad.
I will if you will.
Thanks.
Thank you Pip.
