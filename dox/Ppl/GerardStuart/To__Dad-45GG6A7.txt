Hi Dad,
  I had a real tough time late
last year.  I got all messed up
on speed && coke... had no
job for months... police
picked me up for running
naked in the rain before
Christmas.  I got pretty
depressed && suicidal... gave
up.  Moved several times.  Thought
I had lost my marbles.  Visited
Mom && Ange... started to care
again && tried to clean up.
         Super deep in debt.
Landed a job.  Been clean
&& working my tail off since.

                               heh

  I went to E3 last week.
It was super cool.  I've got
lots of work to do too which
is good for me.  Solving probs
thinking && working hard.  I've
been concentrating on keeping
my nose to the grindstone... get
my life in order again which is
why I haven't written.  I'm not
in a good place for much conversation
just yet but I'll let you know when
I'd like to write much back-&&-forth
chatting letters again.
         I love you Dad.
                Love,
                     -Pip
