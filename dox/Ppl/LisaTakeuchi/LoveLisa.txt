Reply-To: 

I'm sorry, Lisa.  I've spent so much time lately trying to give you the
benefit of the doubt... trying to believe that you don't mean to be
inconsiderate... trying to believe that you are trustworthy even when it
seems unlikely.  How can a flibberty-jibbit be trustworthy?  How could
anyone know you will not just change your mind about anything important?
Those are questions I have needed answers to.  Maybe it's too late.  
Maybe you've already changed your mind regarding caring about me at all 
or you don't know how to be considerate enough for me so I'm needing 
something you simply can't give (although that's rather hard to believe, 
it seems more likely that you can but you choose not to for some
reason... I hope there's a reason... maybe you can find it).  I try to 
justify what you do or say somehow because I don't want to believe the 
conclusions I keep arriving at.  Your answers so far haven't been good 
ones.  You only care about me when you're not too tired?  It's simply 
too bad for me that I have trouble trusting you?  There's nothing you 
can do about whatever I'm gonna believe?  That's bullshit!  I would put 
warranted trust in you if you showed me that you are trustworthy (with 
small && big things).  You could show me that you care... that you're 
concerned... by being considerate.  Instead you change your mind, you 
blow me off, you mock me, you call me crazy, you hang up on me, you hurt
me.  I need reassurance.  I need a woman who cares about me... who cares 
that I trust her && gives me reason to do so.  You either expect me to 
trust you blindly or you're nonchalant (I'm not sure which)... What can 
you do about what I'm gonna think?  I guess nothing if you don't want 
to... if you're unwilling.  I tell you what I need but you don't care.  
I can't make up excuses for you or imagine that you have good 
intentions while you hurt me anymore.  Maybe you're back at all your 
jobs now && won't take time to think about it (even if just for your 
own benefit)...  You have to show me you care about me if you want me 
at all (&& I need you not to change your mind about that!... that
meaning whether you want me, whether you care about me, whether you are
committed to showing me that I matter... my feelings matter to you).  I
don't believe you anymore.  I hardly trust you.  I think you probably
made love to Leif many times while you were gone && lied to me about it.
It seems almost impossible that the two of you could have had the past
you've had, that he would still totally want you (even be longing to
marry you still), that you would change your mind about whether you 
want him too && wonder what's up && maybe if there is still some great
love between you, that you two would sleep in bed together the whole 
time, && somehow, not have any manner of sex.  I'm naive to believe 
such an improbability.  I really wanted to believe without reason... 
because it hurts so much to believe what is most likely.  I'm just a 
fool... a melodramatic lonely love-struck romanceless foolish boy.  
It should be thoroughly obvious that I care about you immensely (I 
imagine everyone who knows me well can easily tell).  I don't 
flip-flop about that.  I've been dependable for you.  Trustworthy && 
caring.  Have I ever dropped those balls for you?  Have I betrayed 
your trust even slightly (indeed the time I ejaculated inside you 
qualifies here but I had no pretext to understand how you felt && 
once I learned, I told you that I wouldn't do it again [unless of 
course you get on the pill or something] && I have adhered to that 
committment since).  Have I been uncaring... insensitive... even 
fucking ungentlemanly, disrespectful, unappreciative of you in any 
serious way?  I don't think so.  The things I've flip-flopped
about are whether I can trust you when you constantly do && say things
that demonstrate that you're not trustworthy && don't really care to 
be.  Maybe you can never make up your mind.  Maybe you really do want 
me && love me one minute && can't stand me the next.  I need something 
better than that.  You can be a flibberty-jibbit about many things in 
your life that I can totally accept && even understand... but I can't 
stand to be only appreciated sometimes... when you feel like it... when 
you're not tired... when you haven't changed your mind yet.  I'm sorry 
if you can't change... if you can't care about me all the time like I 
do for you... if you can't appreciate me... if you can't be 
considerate... trustworthy, dependable.  Those things are all of course
useful even in small quantities (before you flip away from them) but 
their true value && strength is in constancy.  I need you to make a 
lasting decision.  Either you decide you care about me && love me && 
then you do it (not just start && stop && start && stop)... or, you 
determine that you really can't make up your mind even when the future 
of whatever possible serious relationship we could have is at stake.  
You must acknowledge that I need to be loved without fail && that you 
are incapable of doing it or it's not worth it to you or whatever else 
might be the case.  I've been laying in bed here tormented... angry,
frustrated, && heart-broken.  There's nothing more I can do.  I can't
make you love me && I don't mean to expect you to be someone you're not.
So who are you?  I need to love deeply && be loved constantly by a 
wonderful woman.  Please help us both out by answering this question: 
Are you the woman who cares about me, who wants to love me or not?  I 
still love you regardless but I'm weary with all the time I spend hurt 
by you (I'm also weary from sleep deprivation but you're much more 
important to me than some stupid rest which I can't attain anyway 
unless my mind stops racing long enough).  Please let me know if you 
discover anything similar about yourself.  It would mean a lot to me.  
Thank you.  I don't know what else to do.  I was hoping you'd have 
thought about things while you were away (but maybe you were in Leif's 
arms the whole time anyway) && maybe you could have already arrived at 
some good conclusions you could stick to (good for yourself && I was 
hoping also that you'd see how much I love you && decide that you 
won't waver with me anymore in order to keep me ... which would also 
be good for me... for that is my dream... that you, Lisa Rodriguez 
Takeuchi would truly love me all the time).  Please take time to think 
intently as soon as you have time.  You are my love, Lisa.

ps. I was able to fall asleep after I wrote this last night but I 
decided that I wouldn't send it until I woke up && re-read it to make 
sure that I didn't say anything rash that I didn't really mean.  The 
whole point of this... shit, the point of nearly everything I do... 
is to figure out whether you truly love me or not (which doesn't mean 
only sometimes).  I sadly doubt that you do.  I have given you my heart 
unnecessarily && foolishly.  Now please decide what you'll do about us.
