Hello Inga,                                                    51CCCTD

  The point of this letter is to make a few things clear in case you
did not know them or did not foresee their degree.  It is not to
change your mind... just to inform you so that you are better equipped
to change your mind && take different action should you choose to.

  That said, I like you a lot.  I'd totally like to spend more time
with you && hang out more.  I like how you think && what you say, the
sound of your voice, && I'm attracted to your beauty.  I think about
you often && look forward to seeing you.

  We haven't known each other very long so I'm not thoroughly secure
or confident that you reciprocate but it seems that you do.  Since I
don't know you very well, it's difficult for me to guess what your
hopes are, what your motivations might be, etc. which leaves a lot to
my imagination.

  It makes me extremely uncomfortable for the three of us to be in the
same room until you give me more thorough insight into your intentions.
I think it's remarkably inconsiderate of you to put me into that
situation without direction.  I imagine it was worse for the other guy.
I'm expecting that you just don't know what you want && aren't
sensitive about things like this so it's not meant to hurt me or him
but it seems to be doing a good number on both of us.

  So what kind of directions am I talking about?  Well here's an
example of what I'd quite like to hear:  "Pip, I like you very much.  I
think we could have fun dating each other for a while && I can even
imagine a serious relationship could develop between us someday.
You're a good guy && I want to be around you more.  This other guy, my
ex, he lied, cheated, && stole from me.  He && I have a lot of history
&& we're still friends so it's difficult for me to end things abruptly
with him but it's the best way for now.  We haven't rekindled any of
our old romance.  I've told him I want him out of my house by Friday.
He's going back to his parents' house or New York.  I'm sorry if I
inadvertently used you as leverage against him while he was here.  It
was difficult to tell him off directly so having you there demonstrated
to him that I'm moving on.  I didn't mean to hurt you in the process."

  Here's what I'd least like to hear:  "Pip, I've completely been using
you to make my ex jealous.  I knew he'd be coming && you seemed like
a convenient way to force him to get his act together && prove without
doubt that he's going to move here && be with me && that he loves me
&& that we belong together.  I couldn't tell you this until everything
worked out but now that it has, here's your goodbye.  He && I are
totally back together again so it's time for you to shove off."

  It seems most likely that you don't know what you want so neither of
those are realistic... but they're what you've left me to imagine &&
it's hard to feel good about being a tool in both scenarios.  Probably
the real middle ground is that you're sleeping with him && constantly
considering getting back into a committed relationship with him but
it's just not a compelling idea yet so you'll hang out with me for a
whatever you like me for until then.  I can't imagine why you'd want to
make us all uncomfortable together repeatedly though unless you have
one of the above agendas.

  The more you know what you want, care about, dream about... && the
more you convey that to me, the better equipped I will be to help you
or at least be hurt less by you if either of those matter to you.  If
you have no idea whether you'd rather be with him or me or both,
please don't put us all together.  It's a mess.  Thanks for reading.

-Pip
