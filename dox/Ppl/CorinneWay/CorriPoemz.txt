THE PERFECT ROSE
----------------
It was of purest white,
with a hint of pink around the edges.
It was the only one there,
all by itself.
I reached out to touch it,
Ouch!
How was I to know,
that a perfect rose still had thorns?

                            -for that book Mike Lamb gave us as kids

MY LOVE FOR HIM
---------------
Beside me he stands
holding out his hands
Supporting me
protecting me
I see him there
He doesn't know how much I care!
Does he even realize
My life is full of lies?
To the casual passer by
I don't care if he lives or dies
But deep down beneath my crust
I feel as though I'm sure to bust.
I love him more than life,
I want to be his wife
Why can't I tell him this
It could all be explained with a kiss
Yet, that's impossible
my life is too doubtable
The one wish I hold inside
is to tell him of the love I hide
But somehow
I can't tell him now
Is it because he won't listen?
Or the manner I live my life in?
Do I feel unworthy
of the love showered upon me?
I want to bare my soul
to fill this black, empty hole.
I know his love for me will never dim,
so why can't I tell him of my love for him?

                                    -For Darin

DO YOU LOVE ME?
---------------
I see him walking there alone
Does he see me watching him
Who's he thinking of, is it me?
Which way for this relationship does he intend?

My heart is breaking, torn in two.
My life is crumbling, oh what to do?
He claims he'd die if he were to lose me
How much I want to believe him, he doesn't have a clue.

He smiles down at me and holds me near
He snuggles close, breathing in my scented hair,
"You're beautiful" he whispers in my ear
But will you handle me with proper care?

I've given him my heart, to do with as he pleases
should I ask for his, do I dare?
Is it safe for me to dream about?
My heart is breaking, but who said life is fair?

To him I give my future happiness,
on a platter pieced together with my dreams,
garnished with my love.
I love you more than anything,
    but do you love me?

                                    -For Darin

WRONG
-----
The night was dark,
The moon was gone,
The stars were hidden,
Something was wrong.

I could feel it deep inside me,
growing, growing, on and on.
I couldn't describe it, I couldn't control it.

A feeling of sorrow, as if
someone dear to me was gone.
I didn't know why or how,
but something was wrong.

To what place or time,
did this feeling belong?
It was stronger now,
something was wrong!

I knew that soon
my control, it would be beyond.
I had to get away,
something was wrong.
I had to get away,
something was wrong.

My emotions I could not contain.
How much longer would this go on?
My thoughts were not my own,
something was wrong.

Suddenly, as if it was never there,
the feeling, the sensation, was gone.
I couldn't explain it, I didn't want to try.
But something had been wrong.

                                    -For me

THE BOY
-------
Once, a long, long time ago
I knew an unusual boy.
His name,
I no longer know.
But still he is a vivid memory.
I'd see him as I walked to class
standing there,
all alone.
He would wave
as I went by
Never saying much.
To a tree
he seemed to listen.
Being sheltered as I was
this seemed rather odd.
But I never asked him why.
Then one day,
my curiosity overcame me,
and I asked the question
"Why, all alone
do you stand there,
talking to a tree?"
"Oh, I'm not talking to the tree!"
Said he,
"This lovely old oak,
is talking to me!"

                                    -For Mike

GONE
----
Where do the days go,
when they are gone?
Where are the minutes hiding?
The clock is ticking, on and on.

Do the hours slip away
behind closed doors?
Do the seconds hide
in all the closed drawers?

Where does the time go?
Where does it fly to?
One day giving way to another,
does yesterday come back anew?

Does the time fly into the sky
up above the clouds so free
leaving all the people wondering
with nothing but their memories?

                                    -For me

HIS EYES
--------
He looks down through eyes changed
eyes clouded by tears
tears of love,
tears of pain.
He watches us.
He watches all of us.
He sees us grow and change.
He sees life created, destroyed.
Every hour of every day
Someone lives, someone dies.
Someone loved is gone
Oh where did we go wrong?
His eyes see things others do not.
Pain, and something we've forgot.
He can see the innocence,
the joy in life renewed.
He is the Almighty, the Everlasting.
We know not what He knows.
We see not what He sees.
He watches us from high above.
He watches over us.

                                    -For Tricia

TOGETHER
--------
Walking through this world together
hand in hand, side by side.
Triumphant over all our troubles
When we stand beside each other
I can handle anything
all worries that the world gives to me
Because I know you're near
taking care of everything.
When life is too much for me
and I think I just might give up
You're standing by to keep me going
Always caring, no matter how cruel the world may be.
And I know that when I need you
you'll always be there
forever looking out for me
And you know I will always be there
looking out for you.

                                    -For Lisa

THAT GREAT MYSTERY
------------------
What a great wonder
What a great mystery
Is the deep blue sea
Do we really know
what it hides,
what lies beneath
the crashing waves?
Will we ever know
the name of
every creature
down below the
clear blue waters?
Will we ever see
every mountain,
every valley
hidden amongst
the salt filled sea?
Does that wide expanse
of water hide
creatures of another world?
Does that water conceal
wonders we
will never dream of?
Will we ever know?

                                    -For Kimby

IN HIM WE HAVE A FRIEND
-----------------------
In Him we have a friend
forever beside us
always along side us
never faltering, always near.
His hands protect us
His arms carry us.
With Him near
there is nothing to fear.
He is our Counselor, our Savior.
In Him we have a friend.
I fear not
for He is all powerful.
With Him around, I rest easy,
fearing nothing.
I've dedicated my life to Him,
opening my Heart to Him.
For in Him we have a friend.
His love will never leave us
for He will never forsake us.
And whenever I call
He will answer
because in Him we have a friend.
When mortals leave us
when prophets desert us,
when family forget us,
in Him we have a friend.
Yes, in Him we have a friend.

                                    -For me

TOGETHER (another)
--------
I was walking along the street
my eyes cast down.
Suddenly, for reasons I cannot explain
I looked up, blinking at the sun.
And there you were,
walking towards me,
a smile upon your face.
I looked into your big green eyes,
the sun shining on your red-blond hair.
You looked back at me,
Your smile growing even wider.
From that moment I knew it was meant to be.
You were mine and I was yours.
and to this day
we walk through life together.

                                    -For Lisa

HIM
---
I go through each day
looking for the man
who is my only one,
searching everywhere I can.

Will I ever find him?
Will my quest ever end?
Oh why can't I discover
that one special friend?

I know I shouldn't worry,
I know I shouldn't fret.
But when I see people kissing
Love is so hard to forget.

One day I will find him,
This I swear to you.
One day we'll be together
and I will no longer feel blue.

                                    -For Him

IT'S RAINING
------------
Drip Drop Drip.
It's raining.
Tears from heaven.
It's raining.
Washing all.
Washing me.
It's raining.
Drip Drop Drip.
It's raining.
I cry no more.
It's raining.
Healing me.
Saving me.
It's raining.
It's raining.

                                    -For me

JUST A FRIEND
-------------
The tears rolled gently down my cheeks
washing away memories of you
like rain drops in a spring shower
cleansing my soul, making it new.

The pain you gave so freely
is vanished from me for goods
Never again will I op'n
My heart to your sweet words.

You left scars on my heart
I try hard to erase
No one else knows of them
They're far behind my face.

You come to me on your knees
begging for another chance
You say you miss my smile,
You miss the way I dance.

You claim you have changed,
You've started life anew.
Now you want me back
You think I want you too.

After all those nights I cried
wondering how to keep you
I lost you to someone else,
And NOW you want me too?!

I'm sorry, you came to late.
I've found someone else who loves me
Someone who really cares.
Now you're just a friend to me.

                                    -For Darin

THE RAIN IS FALLING
-------------------
The rain is falling
Pouring out the sorrows of the sky.
The rain is falling
cleansing the world.
of all that will soon die.
The rain is falling
soothing all my fears.
The rain is falling.
I am watching it fall.
Watching it fall to the ground.
The rain is falling.
Listen to its music.
Listen to its sound.
The rain is falling.
                                    -For me

THE NOISE
---------
Noise, noise, noise!
I can't hear myself think!
I'm so confused!
I can't breath!
So much noise!
Make it stop! Please!
The world is closing around me!
Oh make it stop!
The noise!
The noise!
Why me? Why now?
Make it stop!
I can't breath!
Oh the noise!
The noise...it's gone.
...everythings gone.

                                    -For the old man who always mows the
                                     lawns at 8:00 on Saturday mornings

YOUR TIME
---------
You stand there all alone
pretending you don't care
trying to make the world
Believe what's barely there.

Your confidence is false
Your self-esteem is low
The world can see more
than you're willing to show

You walk through life alone
Doubting all those that care,
concealing your deep pain
that I can see is there.

Will you ever know that
you are my guiding strength?
If you ask I would go
to many a great length.

I love you more that life
though of yourself you may
not have a great opinion
I hope you hear what I say.

You have no reason to
feel shame or disgrace
you're everything to me
you'll see one of these days.

Stop hiding from the world,
for you have no reason.
You'll bloom out beautiful
in you're time and season.

                                    -For my brother

I'VE BEEN BIT
-------------
I get this funny feeling
deep withing my heart
Whenever you're around
that's when it's sure to start.

I don't understand it
I only know it's there.
I can't explain it.
I think it means I care.

I get butterflies and chills
when your eyes gaze into mine,
everytime we're together
I know I glow and shine.

It's a good feeling
I almost like it,
now I'm almost positive,
by the love bug, I've been bit.

                                    -For Scott

HAVE YOU EVER
-------------
Have you ever looked
at a perfect snowflake
just before it melts?
Have you ever seen
the bright, shinning sun
at the moment before it sets?
Have you ever timed
the crackling lightning
to see how long it takes
to touch the earth?
Have you ever watched
the crisp waters of a wave
just before it brakes?
Have you ever thought
how great these wonders are?
Have you ever thanked
the Almighty Creator,
whose life was given
for these treasures?

                                    -For all those storm riding days when I
                                     watched the snowflakes.

WORDS
-----
The words are running
running through my mind
I don't understand
what they can mean.
They skip across the blackness
keeping their secrets.
Hidding their meaning
The words dance into my thoughts
distracting me,
confusing me,
frustrating me.
They leave a trail
a trail that I cannot follow.
They leave it across my mind
they leave it to tease me
to tempt me and to please me.
The words just keep running,
running through my mind.

                                    -For me

UNSEEN
------
It doesn't make sense
there is no rhyme or reason
puzzeling it is indeed
for it has no specific season.

It hides in the corners
undetected in the shadows
unseen in the darkness
inflicting our deepest sorrows.

Very few ever know of it
even less truelly care
and not one person will admit
that the creature is truelly there.

In the deep recesses
of our subconscience minds
we can only imagine what this horror
truelly does to human kind.

And on dark, moonless nights
a few, brave people, chosen by fate
gather together in small, scared groups
to discuss this terror, known only as hate.

                                   -For that feeling I get when I'm frustrated

TOMORROW USED TO BE A DAY AWAY
------------------------------
Tomorrow used to be a day away
Until the night turned empty
Until the night grew long and weary
Tomorrow used to be a day of which to dream
of which to dream happy dreams.
Now the day is long, long and lonely
The darkness stretches out before me
beckoning to me, calling to me.
Offering me peace, tranquility.
The night no longer scares me,
It gives me the comfort I seek,
a chance to escape to nothingness
a chance to escape.
The night is calling to me,
How shall I answer?
Coming...Coming...
Tomorrow used to be a day away,
now its gone forever.

                                    -For everything

WHO WILL GO WITH ME?
--------------------
In my time of sorrow
who will hold my hand?
In my hour of need
who will understand?

Who will tell me
everything's all right?
Who will comfort me
long into the night?

In this world
am I all alone?
Must I travel
along a path unknown?

Will anyone join me
on my journey?
On my quest for answers,
who will go with me?

                                    -For everything

WHEN THE ROBIN SINGS HIS SONG
-----------------------------
If I should die tomorrow,
who would cry for me?
If suddenly I should cease,
Would anyone care?
If tomorrow came,
and I wasn't there,
would anyone feel pain?
If in the morning
I didn't wake
would you feel sorrow?
If, by some odd chance,
I shouldn't take another breath,
would you even notice?
The sun would shine
on another girls face.
And the moon would rise
for another girls pleasure.
The flowers would smell
just as sweetly
and the birds would sing
just as cheerily.
But would your smile
be as wide?
Would your laugh
be quite as loud?
If I should die tomorrow
would every cloud
have a silver linning?
If I should fail to awake
When the robin sings his song,
would you care?

                                    -For everything

TEARS
-----
Tears are flowing down my face
tears for all I am afraid of,
tears for all I love.
They trickle down my cheeks
whelling up from deep inside,
releasing my hurts
airing out my pains,
caring away my troubles.
With every tear,
my heart grows lighter.
And yet, when no more tears will flow,
My hurts, pains, and troubles
seem to grow greater
for every tear I cried.

                                    -For everything

FLY AWAY
--------
When the pain is great
and the sorrow swallows me whole.
When the hurts dig deep
and the ache grows strong
I wish to get away.
To go somewhere
to a place that smiles
to a land that sings
I wish I could sprout wings
and fly away.
I wish I could imagine myself
in a world where everyone laughs.
I wish I could walk out my door
into another life,
where flowers bloom year round.
When the tears won't stop
and the pain won't go away,
I wish I could sprout wings
and fly away.

                                    -For everything


WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALSO?
-----------------------
The clouds hang low
and the world is till.
The birds do not sing
and the sun does not shine.
Are you as sad as I?
Do the tears run down your face?
Can you understand
this pain I embrace?
The breeze is gone
and the sky is hidding,
will you leave me also?

                                    -For Scott

I CARE
------
Though at first it may seem
to much to even dream,
in this lonely world
into which we are hurled,
there are people who care.
If to live, you should dare,
remember forever
I will leave you never.
Search deep into your heart
Of your life, I am part.
Though you try to push me
to leave you in your misery,
I will be by your side
along life's bumpy ride.
To cheer you when I can,
To lend a helping hand,
To stand along side you,
to comfort and guide you.
Like it or not, I care
and will always be there.

                                    -For Scott

IN A HEARTS BEAT
----------------
In a hearts beat
The lights went out,
the fires were quenched
and I was filled with doubt.
The flowers wilted
and the leaves began to fall,
the sun went down
and the shadows grew tall.
The darkness grew thick
and the air hung heavy,
my eyes blinked back the tears,
and my life became unsteady.
My mind went blank
as I grasped the knife,
one swift movement
would end my hopeless life.
The birds ceased their happy twitters,
The world was growing dim.
I thought of my friends,
I cursed each one of them.
The tears would not stop
The pain grew stronger
I saw my only escape
I could wait no longer.
Death did not scare me,
I welcomed its peace.
The flame in my heart went out
I longed for blessed release.
In moments nothing would matter,
no one would care,
my heard had beat its last,
but who said life was fair?
I became overwelmed
I could take it no longer,
life did not tempt me,
my grasp on the knife grew stronger.
The note was written and signed
everything was in order
I closed my eyes,
one sharp pain and it was over.

                                    -For everything

SARAH
-----
"It's not fair!"
Sarah said to me.
"Why not?"
I said to Sarah.
"It's just not!"
Sarah said to me.
"Why not?"
I said to Sarah.
"Because it's not!"
Sarah said to me.
"But why not?"
I said to Sarah.
"He shouldn't of!"
Sarah said to me.
"Why not?"
I said to Sarah.
"It's not fair!"
Sarah said to me.

THOUHGTS OF A DISTRAUGHT TEENAGER
---------------------------------
To most
my troubles seem few.
To many
my thoughts
seem shallow.
You say
your life is worse.
You say
your pain goes deepper.
True, that may be.
However,
To me
my sorrows
are greater.

                                    -For Spanish Class

(UNTITLED BECAUSE I'M THINKING OF NOTHING)
------------------------------------------
It's quiet inside my head
although the noise outside is great.
I think of little
except the quiet calm of nothing.
My heart is at peace
My mind is at rest.
I ignore the turmoil surrounding me
enjoying my placid nothingness.
My mind remains blank
as I watch through unseeing eyes.
I do not reply
when my thoughts are interrupted.
I am unwilling
to give up my calm world
for the pain of another.

                                    -For a sunny day

THE RACE
--------
The sound of my heart
drowning out the yells of the crowd.
The feel of the sand
pushed into my fingertips
by the weight of my body.
The dropping of my stomach
when the gun goes off.
The hurdle before me.
The hurdle behind me.
The white chalk line
passing quickly beneath me.
The sounds of cheers, groans
and tears
It is over.
Now and only now
do I breath.

                                    -For Keagler

CUT ME TO THE HEART
-------------------
My heart you touched,
My life you changed
My soul you spoke to
My love you took.

You held me, you loved me
In my anger you consoled me,
When I cried you were there
My laughter you shared.

I opened my heart
I took you into confidence
I let you near and loved you
But we weren't meant to be.

You're to cynical, to deep
You told me to forget you
You cut me to the heart
When you set me free.

                                    -For Darin

A HEART
-------
A heart is a fragile thing
and pain it cannot endure
To scratch it is to break it,
and hurtful words will kill it.
To many people don't understand,
how fragile a heart really is.
When love is all it needs,
indifference is all its given.
A heart is a delicate thing,
to hurt it is so easy,
to turn it cold is not hard
and to break it takes only a second.
Damaging a heart is simple.
Repairing it is not so easy.
To break a heart takes no skill,
but to fix one takes more.
To fix a broken heart takes love.

                                    -For Darin

A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER
----------------------
What a wonderful thing is a blank sheet of paper,
Think of all it could become.
A story of worlds not real.
Or a picture,
within someones heart
of days forever gone.
It could become a song
hiding on your pencil tip
Or a love letter
expressing someones deep devotion.
A blank sheet of paper
could become almost anything,
imagined or real.
A verse from a poem
might decorate it's lines,
or perhaps
it will become
a note
sharing memories of deep friendship.
A blank sheet of paper,
indeed,
is a wonderful thing.

                                    -For me

TO DREAM
--------
To dream
is a skill long lost and much unused.
It's beauty is forgotten,
its splendor is not known.
To dream
is a talent not taught
and of value untold.
A dream
is worth a thousand thoughts
and even more
in happy words.
A dream
can lift your spirits
and raise your soul
to heights beyond the tree tops.
To dream a dream properly
will take you
far beyond this worlds pain
to places worthy of dreams.

                                    -For my dreams

WHY MUST IT BE THIS WAY?
------------------------
Too much is happening too fast.
Too many thoughts
Too many emotions
rushing through my veins.
I've seen too many things
at far too young an age
I see the evidence
of hate all around me.
I'm sickened
I'm confused.
Where does it come from?
How can we be rid of it?
Why must it be this way?
In this world
of so many different people
why must it be this way?
Why can't we
solve problems peacefully?
Why must star-crossed lovers
be star-crossed?
Why must children
dig graves for loved pets?
This world
is upside down
backwards
and inside out.
Why must it be this way?

                                    -For Nelson

IF THE TREES COULD TALK
-----------------------
If only the trees could talk
they would have a story to tell
Of summers gone
and winters yet to be.
Of Springs beauty
and falls lasting glow.
They would tell us of
lovers secret renevous
and childrens sweet laughter.
If only the trees could talk
we would hear stories unending
and truths untold.
They would tell us of
the mourners sorrowful tears
and of secret pacts between best friends.
The trees could reveal
the languange of the birds
and the cryptic song of the wind.
They could weave
a story like no other
of present past and future,
if only the trees could talk.

                                    -For the red elm tree

IT COULD HAPPEN...
------------------
The mountains could move
the waters could part
the trees could sing
and we could grow a heart.
The children could be happy
the wars could stop
the birds could fly free
and not another bomb could drop.
the bison could return
the hate for love we could exchange
the ozone could be whole
and the Sioux could ride an open range.
The politicians could tell the truth
the lawyers could refrain from lies
the doctors could be incorrupt
and there could be no need for spies.
The trees could grow in clean earth
the flowers could bloom to open skies
the birds could sing a new song
and I could live where no one dies.
The dreams I have could come true
the worries I have could slacken
the world could change
It could happen.

NOT FORGOTTEN
-------------
Her name,
I still do not know.
Her history,
I will never know.
But her face
I will never forget.
She stood before me
I do not know how long
Her eyes burning into mine
I thought I saw her soul
maybe she saw mine
A tear ran down her cheek
I never asked her why.
Time had no prominence
words had no consequence
There was no need to speak.
She touched my hand,
but I think it was my heart.
She walked away
her back straight and tall
Her body disappearing in the crowd
her memory ingraved on my heart.
Her life touched mine
My life touched hers,
but not a word was said.
On that one forgotten day
I met an unforgettable woman.
Though nary a mouth was opened
nor a tongue was moved
my heart was touched
by my mothers hand.

THE RIGHT WORDS
---------------
I see a girl denying His love
I see her crying
never knowing the difference He would make
I see the pain in her eyes
and I hear it in her voice.
In His arms I wish to lay her
But never the right words
do I offer her
Never the right thoughts
do I convey.
I know how much she hurts
for I once hurt in this same way
I want to tell her of His love
to stop her tears from falling
In my heart I know
there is a way.
There is a God who could save her.
Yet her heart is closed
and no love reaches it.
Because I know not
the right words.
When time began
each soul created,
was split
in two.
Each wandering the earth
in search of
the other
in search
of a partner
a friend
and soulmate
True love
is their reunion.

FRUSTRATION
-----------
The boy accross the aisle rattled his paper
The girl behind me dropped her pencil
and Cenon, on my left, snored.
I could feel the tension building
As my teeth ground and my shoulders siezed
I tried to relax
but the noise
against the quiet
it wouldn't let me.
I tried to find escape
in amongst the mess
the confusion
But it wasn't there,
or I couldn't find it.
My stomach knotted and the noise went on.
There was a buzzing in my ears
and I could feel the energy on the air
for the tension in my knees.
I wanted to scream
to fight and explode.
But release is never free
so I sat there
grinding my teeth
and feeling my shoulders sieze.

                                    -For long days in a hot classroom
                                     or That terrible feeling you get when
                                        you are completely helpless.

POETRY
------
It must be written
a line at a time
and whatever
you wanted to say
never gets said.
Its used
to express feelings
without ever saying
what your feeling.
Sometimes it rhymes
and sometimes it doesn't
it depends
on how much emotion
you are willing to share.
And then when you finish
you realize
you haven't expressed
one thought or sensation
which you had set out to express.
your heart is still full
and you write another.

                                    -For me

DON'T SAY LOVE
--------------
There are words much longer
and more difficult to pronounce.
It is in everyones vocabulary
and can be used in many ways.
But if you ask me,
it's the hardest word to say
even harder to use correctly.
It is confusing and condeming,
regretted and misunderstood.

If you haven't guessed it by now,
I'll tell you what it is.
It is love, the usual kind.
Very few people know what to do with it
and no boy I know could define it.

So please, don't try to use it
unless you intend to hold me close
until I'm old and fat and gray.
Unless you plan on staying beside me
when I yell at you and cry.
And then let me blame you for starting a fight.

Don't say love untill you will
share my worries, pain, and life.
Until you can laugh with me
as we watch the people go by.
And dig throuhg my treasured junk
without throwing any of it away.

Before you say love
find out what it means.
Then you can buy me flowers just because
and help me find my glasses in the dark.
Then you can watch me watch life go by
and not worry about the time.
Then you can accept me with all my faults
and you'll cherish them as part of me.

So please, don't say love unless you can.

                                    -For Philip

A BUTTERFLY
-----------
Fearless.
Lost.
Or maybe misguided.
It flew through the opening.
It fluttered past my foot
and did a flip,
showing off.

I stared
aghast, at its presumptuous attitude.
In wonder
in awe
that somewhere
in amongst the cynics,
evils,
and cruel people,
a butterfly
could fly free.


GONE
----
I grew up in a garden
Where the sun always shown so bright.
I grew up with the flowers above me
and the dark soil beneathe me.
And when the wind blew
they always were there to hold me.
I was safe
I was secure.
My days were happy
and my nights serene.
Then one day
I saw a change,
There was a difference,
I didn't know why.
But slowly I watched them fade
grow sicker and die.
Why wasn't it me?
I should have contracted
their disease.
Oh, why, why wasn't it me?
Their beauty is gone
with all it's lustre and glory.
All that I loved
all that was important to me
was gone.


I CAN ONLY LOVE HER
-------------------
From a babe she raised me
from the clay, she moulded me
with her words did she guide me
and for this I can only love her

From the oldest of memories
she was there to hold me,
protected by her arm
And for this, I can only love her.

Through my sorrow she stood by me.
In my trouble, she consoled me.
At times she was my only friend.
And for this, I can only love her.

Through all my days 'till now
she gave of her heart
so that I thought it unending.
And for this, I can only love her.

Now I see the error of my ways
her heart has limits, as any mortal
she can only give so much
And for this, I can only love her.

Her heart to me she gave
Willingly and in earnest
Now she needs another
And for this, I can give her mine.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the chance was there
given so freely and with concern,
would you accept it, would you take it?
If you had the opportunity
to give back all that was given,
how would you respond, how would you react?

If you declined, how would you cope?
If, after everything, you chose yourself,
could you keep yourself?
When you could have given everything
but decided selfishly to decline
how would you see yourself?

But if you answered yea,
would your heart rise above?
then could you see your own
and know that it was good?
Through all of it, you could
and would, know that it was right.

When she gave everything
how could you withhold it yet?
If, given a chance,
an opportunity
to hand it back, heart & soul,
how could you not?


EVERYONE
--------
No person's life is perfect
No one knows not suffering
Behind your fa‡ade
there remains a stain of deepest pain
and hardened scars,
where once was beheld something beautiful
now it rules, from the inside out
and our irritability is the only evidence.
And it exist.
Memories unwanted, and dreams unfinished
remain to remind
each one of their pain.
Forever of their pain.


ONLY ONE
--------
His love is larger
and lasts much longer
Even when
you're at the very end
He'll be there.
No more regrets
It's time, to forget
and know that He is love.
When all is done
and life becomes unstrung
you're ready to distrust
and then, He'll be there,
to share with you His love.
For He is
the only one.
