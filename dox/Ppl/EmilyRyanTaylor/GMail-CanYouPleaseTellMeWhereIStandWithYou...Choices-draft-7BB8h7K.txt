Hello Emmy,

Can you please tell me what you consider me now... && what you'd most prefer to consider me if that is something different than what you actually consider me at the moment?  Just a friend again?  Not even that much anymore?  Are you even still receiving e-mails from me?  I don't think I've had any confirmation that I've gotten any e-mail through to you for the past few days (P.S. I initially wrote this before receiving your reply agreeing to avoid text-messages on my phone while I'm home.) so it seems lots of our communication channels themselves are in a state of disrepair (whether voluntary corruption was introduced as a protective mechanism or not).  Please let me address some of the issues you have raised since you didn't respond to my IMs from earlier today.  I've re-pasted them here because e-mail is obviously my preferred medium when in-person speech is not an option... && without any feedback as to your preference, I think it remains fair to keep choosing this for now.  E-mail has the added bonus that messages can be premeditated && edited before being sent which is only barely a luxury of instant && text messages && not at all available in-person (but the amount of data we communicate to each other in-person just visually is naturally orders of magnitude greater than anything we could describe just through the textual characters necessitated by the other three mentioned mechanisms.  Whether this e-mail && others recently sent by me turn out to never be received or you never find time to read, contemplate, or reply directly to my thoughts below here, well those are just more of the risks I keep taking... && this will at least help me to think more clearly about our issues, which should ultimately keep benefiting both of us eventually.

[10:31] emmy.rowks: You said: Am I not permitted to dive into any details because I do it too thoroughly?

[10:36] emmy.rowks: I say: You have deeply hurt me. You went to a forum in which you know you excel at, knowing that I don't have the time (as I have to take care of 5 kids 24/7) or the inclination to publicly fight with you. That is what you were doing, fighting verbally. That to me is so wrong to do to someone you say you love. Why would you hurt me knowing what a private person I am? You never admit your being wrong, you go and point out how everyone around YOU is wrong, but not you. You gave no true apology to me at all. You keep thinking its okay to continue hurting me after I said I was feeling violated. When did my feelings come into your equation at all? You were like you've given me no reasonable examples why it is a violation. But there is never logic to emotions, you know that. Yet, you continued even after I said it was a violation to me. That is not respecting me at all.

[16:39] PipTigger: I'm back home.  I'd contend with several things you've written above but you mention the imbalance of our respectively available time && proficiency with a particular communicative forum so let me ask one simple question && address the most significant point of disagreement I think we have with what you've written above.

[16:40] PipTigger: What is your *best* form of communication, the one that would be *most* fair to you for me to employ for us to work things out?

[16:42] PipTigger: I have told you repeatedly that *I* believe there is *always* logic to emotions, although most people don't believe this, cannot perceive it, && have difficulty imagining it too... even if it can be reasoned... logically && consistently.  Therefore, as I have tried to explain to you many times, I most certainly do *not* know that there's "never logic to emotions."  I am convinced of quite the opposite.

[16:53] PipTigger: This is perhaps the crux of all of our greatest difficulties because if you're certain there's never logic && I'm certain there always is, that leaves no common ground at all... && worse, it encourages you to feel that logic should never dissuade your feelings && me to never be dissuaded by your illogical claims (by which I mean that I may be able to see && describe all sorts of logical explanations for your emotions but at some point, I will have to reach an impasse where you deny logic illogically, which is where any of our common experience or understanding probably has to stall, dissolve, && fade away).

So... without having received any response to the above, I'm now feeling inclined to, && justified in including a, reply to all of your issues in my typical decompositional style.

[10:36] emmy.rowks (part0): "I say: You have deeply hurt me. ..."

I say: You were already deeply hurt && you are not carefully identifying where your deep hurts are coming from.  If you want to minimize abuse && have accountability, I provided a way for us to do so among our most trusted support group.  If you think it's fair to call that desire for open scrutiny (so that no abuse can easily go on behind closed doors) as something which deeply hurts you, I have to question your ability to accurately perceive the depth of any hurt or whether you're still just hurting from past afflictions && continuing to lay blame on everyone else (which maybe goes hand-in-hand with not really trusting your family or closest friends, hmm).

[10:36] emmy.rowks (part1): "... You went to a forum in which you know you excel at, ..."

I've already asked what forum you most prefer... or do you suck at every form && expect everyone to be just as incapable of communicators as you.  Do I need to buy a camera to take evocative stills to speak your language?  So what would you have had me do, go knock on everyone's doors?  You're unreasonable.

[10:36] emmy.rowks (part2): "... knowing that I don't have the time (as I have to take care of 5 kids 24/7) or the inclination..."

I don't know what you have time or inclination for.  I don't think you really know from day-to-day either.  Sometimes you read a lot (online or off), sometimes you type a lot, sometimes you talk or listen a lot.  Sometimes you don't have time to do hardly any of those for days at a time.  Don't blame me for your purported lack of time or your need to care for your kids.  I know you have kids.  I know you have responsibilities.  You set your priorities.  You make time for what's important to you.  You obviously found time to blog a bunch of unsubstantiated bullshit about me way more "publically" than anything I've done that you are arguing was done to hurt you.  Maybe if you took time to read what I wrote, you'd have a different opinion.  Maybe if you thought more && reacted less quickly, with less fear, you'd understand more && make better decisions.  It's up to you whether you take enough time to read this (or even go back && read the past shit too).  I'm giving you ample time.

[10:36] emmy.rowks (part3): "... to publicly fight with you. That is what you were doing, fighting verbally. ..."

Prove it.  Describe to me the universal distinctions between communication, opinion, argument, && verbal fights.  Let's assume that you can do that sufficiently && I agree you know a little about some distinguishing features of these categories && further that you're able to provide a couple examples that I was indeed "fighting verbally," just for the sake of *this* argument.  Well let's then look at the context.  You accused me of all sorts of unjustified things like abusing you.  If I was in a verbal fight with you (&& likely still am), then if you attacked me groundlessly first, I remain defensive.  I keep defending myself && only trying to neutralize your threats or accusations, to stem the tide of your onslaught... then you pretend that me e-mailing a dozen of our closest people in seeking additional perspective, insight, && accountability... through thoroughly detailed, meticulously reasoned examinations of all the relevant details... how the hell does that justify you making even more baseless accusations to the whole world about my mental stability, purported drug addictions, violent tendencies, etc..  You totally suck right now.  You're being way worse than anything I've ever done wrong to you, which you still haven't explained to me what was so wrong about it.  You have explained your feelings.  I know (after hearing many times) how hurt && humiliated && betrayed you *felt* but what justified any of those feelings.  Tell me that && then you stand a chance of persuading me to see that I've done anything wrong.  If I exposed the raw truth of our communications && opinions to a select audience while you've lied or at least mischaracterized me out of your own fear to the whole world, who is more wrong?  Who is being more hurtful?  You doubt that you're driving me away?  Can you perceive anything accurately?  It's an honest question.

[10:36] emmy.rowks (part4): "... That to me is so wrong to do to someone you say you love. ..."

Why?  What's so wrong regarding either what I did specifically or general verbal fights as your original text is saying?  How will people come to common understanding if they can't or choose not to argue their points?  If you think arguments don't happen between lovers, I *have* been wrong to think we could ever love each other && I must thank you for reacting in all these ways so that I can withdraw my love from you because you cannot possibly deserve it if you persist in thinking this.

[10:36] emmy.rowks (part5): "... Why would you hurt me knowing what a private person I am? ..."

I didn't intend to hurt you.  I had to make a tough decision && so far, I still feel justified in standing behind it.  You accused me of abuse && lack of accountability.  I exposed our actual communications (not merely my interpretation of you or what has happened between us) to a select group that I haven't been abusive && am eager to be accountable.  You then used this as justification to slander me in a real public forum.  You continue to hurt me worse than I've hurt you.  You may still be hurt worse than me... but that is not my fault.  You're probably just too blinded && anguished to see that.  I'm sorry for you.  I've done what I can... but it's really looking time for us to fall apart pretty thoroughly now.  I'm trying to tell you what you need to do to salvage things.  Respond however you choose.  Keep doing whatever you think best.  That's all I've done && what I remind you that I surely will continue to do.

[10:36] emmy.rowks (part6): "... You never admit your being wrong, ..."

You are simply demonstrably wrong about this.  Just yesterday morning, you reminded me that I *did* propose marriage to you when I became elated after watching the Lake House, all filled with romantic hopes of a wonderful love with a brilliant creative intelligent artistic adorable pink-haired mother.  We spoke of marriage so casually so many times, where you were always awkward, bashful, reluctant, or unresponsive so that explicit event accidentally slipped my mind... which is something I still feel guilty for.  When you reminded me of it, not only did I admit that I had been wrong, but I sincerely apologized for forgetting something that, under more normal circumstances, should be something unforgettable.  There's proof.  Your use of the word "never" is absolutely wrong.  Let's step down to something more moderate like if you were trying to say that I *rarely* admit to being wrong, or something less absolute.  Prove it.  When have you even once shown me I was wrong && I wouldn't admit it?  Have you shown me?  I'm so patient showing you everything but you don't have time to show me anything, huh?  Well then you'd do better to keep your entirely false accusations to yourself until you have, oh I dunno, maybe a single fucking reason to argue them... && no, sorry, your feelings aren't good reasons until you explain the reasons behind your feelings... but nice try.  The more likely scenario here is that I always admit when anyone shows me I'm wrong but you can't understand that because you'll never admit that you're abusive, no matter how true or how thoroughly && carefully it's presented to you.  Just because you're afraid to admit your faults (or have anyone else correctly identify them && their need of mending) doesn't mean everyone else in general are, or me specifically is, like you in that way.  I'm honest.  What was my big hurtful offense to you?  Being too honest to our family && friends.  Exposing your guarded privacy.  You can't have it both ways.  Be a private liar as you seem to prefer or be an accountable truth-teller as I am.  The choice remains yours but it's becoming clear that if you && I reside on the opposite sides of that boundary, we surely *are* unfit for each other because I'll only go into the shadows momentarily to carry you out from them, because you've claimed that's what you wanted.  If you keep retreating to your private insular irrational unjustifiable concept of reality, don't expect many people to be willing to try to meet you there as I have.  It's a simple truth.  Very few people would be willing to go to where you are.  I have been.  I'm remaining with you to maybe deliver this last message, if you don't respond appropriately && acceptably within the limits I'm setting for my own valid defensive protective purposes.

[10:36] emmy.rowks (part7): "... you go and point out how everyone around YOU is wrong, ..."

Most people *are* wrong about a lot of (if not most here again) things they think they understand && know.  Commonsense is not common.  Should I not point that out or argue in search of better understanding for everyone involved?  I think my search for truth is a good thing && pointing out truths to others is too... even if it hurts feelings sometimes.  I don't rape or enslave people physically.  I am one of the hugest proponents of pure physical freedom.  Think && say whatever you choose, no matter how emotionally hurtful, as long as you don't initiate physical force against anyone else.  It's the Libertarian non-agression principle.  It is Aikido, the way of harmony.  It is using an attacker's force to neutralize them with exactly the amount of counter-force necessary (which will be far far less than they thrust upon you in most circumstances, but exceptions remain).  I admit that it's much more polite && civilized to try not to hurt people's feelings, to harm their typically brittle emotional sensibilities, but I find whole politeness part to be inessential according to my perpetually evolving moral code of honor.  Some people hate to hear the word "fuck" pronounced.  For others, hearing "suicide" is probably more disturbing... or maybe "slaughter", "gun", "terrorist", "Jesus", "bomb", "cunt", "dick", etc..  If such people have earned my respect && they politely request that I behave considerately towards their sensitivities, I'll probably do my best to watch my tongue around them, when in all other circumstances, only G-d's Hebrew name is a sound I refuse to attempt to utter.  I consider all other words acceptable for any serious, playful, or even irreverent && blasphemous purposes.  Since I believe this way, you've got a lot to argue to even get anywhere near convincing me that I've harmed you at all even if I've hurt your feelings terribly.  Prove it.  Justify it.  Explain it.  Cite examples.  Think clearly.  I think you've probably messed up too badly here so I'm not willing to keep going so slowly, trying to hold your hand all the time when you just keep snatching it away like you already know everything but then you prove that you surely don't.  It's time for you to step up in honesty && commitment to communication with me, to start crawling at a decent pace.  If you can't do that within ten days, it will become time for me to run light years away from you (at least as far as any further romantic interest is concerned, even if I might still be a friendly acquaintance who sends some dough for your kids when I can).  You're treating me very badly right now, very unfairly, with less careful explanation or balance than we've ever had before.  I can demonstrate how consistent my balance has remained && how you've misunderstood so many things I've said, placed undue emphasis on single words out-of-context && still apparently feel inexplicably justified solely by your emotional hurts (&& irrespective of whether I'm actually to blame for those) to attack me repeatedly.  This may be your last chance with me.  Time to think && grow && move... or keep sitting there pouting, pretending like you're so helpless && just need someone smarter, more sensitive, && less abusive than me to be willing to voluntarily walk into the train-wreck that is your situation.  Maybe such a man exists && maybe you'll find each other somehow.  I guess that'd be just great for all of us, until you drove him away too, for no good reason.  You never believe in reason.  Your emotions supposedly have none.  Being physically abused for over a decade isn't a reason at all.  It's nothing.  It had no impact on you other than inspiration to break the cycle for your kids.  Maybe you should start by learning how not to abuse a gentle defensive man who has driven thousands of miles to be near you, sacrificed his beloved motorcycle, his job, freely given many thousands of dollars of cash && gifts for your comforts && provision.  I'm not blaming you for me losing my job or my bike.  I haven't.  You might need to re-read && then do it again.  I willingly let go of attachment to those things because they meant little to me compared to you.  I had wanted to keep my job much more than my bike (even though I naturally loved my bike much more than that lame job) because I wanted to continue gaining income to assist you.  Losing those things is my responsibility.  I own that.  Don't pretend I've blamed you.  I haven't.  I voluntarily chose to visit you each weekend && I have loved you so much that I couldn't help but linger until the last possible moment before I needed to speed 400 miles to my office.  I called in every single time that I would be late or absent && they lied about that completely in my termination letter (as well as all the other things they claimed to have spoken with me about before the firing meeting).  The complications which caused me to miss work days or see my bike confiscated in the middle of the state, leaving me to hitchhike to work, these circumstances may have only arisen because I was traveling back && forth to see you, but none of that could possibly be your fault or responsibility at all.  I knew what I was doing && I did the best I could to balance all the things I cared about.  I maintained my priorities diligently.  I still do.  You're rapidly falling from them && maybe you just can't hang on.  Maybe you have to let go of me && me too of you because you're way too broken && nobody can help you by getting involved right now.  Maybe anonymous envelopes filled with cash is exactly what you need, for the next few years, way more than anyone to come meddle && complicate all these fragmented relationships && chaotic tensions, insolence, && giftedness.

[10:36] emmy.rowks (part8): "... but not you. ..."

How do you propose I go about pointing out how wrong I myself am?  That sounds like an interesting exercise that I'd really like to learn... assuming you're referring to some sort of performance self-improvement where people watch you point at yourself && it's not just meditation or a journal / diary in which to collect && reshape your thoughts... because I do those latter ones frequently.  Let's turn it around.  You claim to be pointing out all sorts of things that are wrong with me.  I justify my claims when I do it.  Why can't you?

[10:36] emmy.rowks: "... You gave no true apology to me at all. You keep thinking its okay to continue hurting me after I said I was feeling violated. ..."

Oh really?  Remember how the first few weeks after we started talking daily, you said (ironically a few times) that you get bored of hearing the same thing over && over again?  Well why can't you remember or get bored of apologies from me or yourself asking for them?  I've apologized sincerely for several things that I agreed I had let you down about, or even things that you just felt let down about && I understood that I could speak the words of such an apology without disdain or cynicism && the implication is that I would be saying sorry, asking forgiveness (especially once you're prompting me to apologize), because you're willing to grant such forgiveness.  If you can't remember apologies or are unwilling to forgive your feelings being hurt (especially over an offense that is on uncertain logical footing), you don't deserve anymore apologies.  They're a waste of time with you because you just want to keep imagining everyone else is always wrong && you're always hurt horribly by them instead of the truth that you remain horribly hurt by your past && most of these people who are entrusted near you aren't contributing more hurt, no matter how much you think it's logical to pretend there's no logic in the recklessness of your wild emotions && how you use them to justify any sort of cruel response you can think of to anything.  You punish me for doing nothing wrong, because you're the one who's so angry for being mistreated for 12 years.  I didn't do that to you.  Pay attention now or you won't have to worry about me at all because I can't suffer by your hand indefinitely.  I'm telling you my boundaries.  You have crossed many, both spoken && unspoken ones.  You're headed for the final one.  Make your choice.

[10:36] emmy.rowks: "... When did my feelings come into your equation at all? ..."

Always... but *my* equation consists of way more than just your feelings (even if *yours* doesn't).  I can describe a lot of my equation to you but it would take much of your time && attention, especially once we get to the most essential component, inherent flexibility, dynamism, adaptability.  The equation is constantly breathing, contracting, hemorrhaging, inhaling, coughing, etc..  I am ideally trying to keep my concept of the equation of what goes on between us && what my best role in that can be as something that is even more alive than either of us are alone because it must (under this idealized form) account for exponentially more complexity than either of us would have to endure in isolation... which is not even mentioning the dynamics your kids or ex-husband introduce... which are all profound to say the least).  Please trust me that my best understanding of your feelings always have && will come into every one of my equations.  I know this is difficult for you to perceive when you feel hurt for any reason, but particularly with this recent event where my honesty && openness continues to feel like a severe betrayal of your desire for secrecy && privateness.  It might help you to think about the rest of our relationship && recall how consistently && obviously I have factored your feeling in at all those other times.  Hopefully this can provide you sufficient confidence that I *did* factor your feelings (as well as I could) into the risk I took in writing e-mails to our closest family && friends.  I have never tried to ignore or undervalue your feelings... but I have a lot more to consider than just them.  Please try to understand.

[10:36] emmy.rowks: "... You were like you've given me no reasonable examples why it is a violation. But there is never logic to emotions, you know that. ..."

I believe I know the opposite, as was detailed above.  I believe logic governs reality, which includes all of humanity && emotion.  There may be a repulsive character of cruelty && senselessness from the perspective of having sufficient information to make better decisions, but I believe there's logic to decisions made even in an information void.  I cannot prove this but it remains my suspicion based on my understanding of my own intelligence when scrutinized as carefully as I can under sensory-deprivation.  Can you explain to me what reason I've ever given you to think I could possibly know the illogic of emotions you claim, which is the perfect opposite of what I believe I've actually known for a very long time?  My understanding is that I've never said anything to mislead you in such a way.  I recall several discussions on this topic where I clearly disagreed with your unjustified supposition that there can be no reason or logic behind emotions.  If your mind is already made up, then you must have been incapable of hearing my complaints, because no amount of logic or reason could dispel your notion that emotions must forever remain irrational && incomprehensible to you.  That may be an essential coping mechanism you presently require for security purposes, so I do wish to step cautiously when challenging such a precept (as it seems to be to you).  Know that I never wish to force you to see or think or understand anything differently than makes sense to you.  I have no requirement or expectation that you will ever see the universe or anything in it (us included) in some way that thoroughly resembles the way I see any of those things.  I just expect you to keep trying to see clearly, to find truth, even when it's a struggle.  I don't have many answers.  I'm not saying you'll necessarily see more like me when I write "see clearly" just like I'm not trying to say you'll agree with me && stop struggling when I write "find truth."  If I wanted to say those first things, I simply would.  I try to speak my truths clearly && honestly.  I wish to see clearly && to find truth, even if I've never been able to do either before.  I want to discover how horribly wrong I have been && am so that I can change for the better.  I want to keep struggling to discover how I've been wrong in small ways to adjust those too, for that matter.  You have given me many intriguing suggestions that you are essentially quite like me in this way, deep down, but you remain terribly wounded && anxious about exploring any significant new level of such uncertain change for the perfectly valid && logical fear of unacceptably jeopardizing the health && safety of yourself or your children.  This is why I remain hopeful that a stable financial base could be established for you && kids to someday soon rely upon as a platform on which each of your needed cocoons can be safely constructed && emerged from.  I see this happening primarily from three simultaneous avenues (assuming you wish to have me remain involved && influential on a level capable of contributing to the successful establishment of such a tripod for you):

  0) elite California legal representation to put sharper teeth into the restraining order, force a more fair (i.e., much more favorable to you) re-trial for the divorce (which probably must be filed for very soon, so hopefully Sarah or Melissa can at least just file any needed extension or appeal paperwork for you before any Texas deadline), && further enforceability of each... where you probably deal with most of the legwork && headaches of this one && I'll try to get back into a position to be able to afford any large legal retainers or other associated fees.  The relevant successful conclusion of this will mean government enforced consistency && reliability to your reception of more appropriate financial awards for child && spousal support.  I'm guessing this should ultimately guarantee around $6k to become available absolutely every month for you && your children to live more comfortably on... not so hand-to-mouth.  That seems much more reasonable when I consider the complete circumstances as I imagine any benevolent California judge might observe them.

  1) establishing your personal photography career as healthy && thriving, probably through my support && encouragement for your ongoing education however possible, the strategic purchase of essential equipment initially (which would eventually mushroom from merely strategic && reserved into extravagant as things pick up in all areas), both of us (maybe also assisted by friends) together designing && implementing your new business website that is primarily capable of representing you in each of the ways you'd most want it to, && finally the cultivation of a reliable clientele maybe mostly passively through online print sales but possibly also supplementarily through active for-hire shoots or similar stuff that you'd like to do.

  2) otherwise direct funding... primarily reserved for pure survival or essential morale purposes (which admittedly encompasses just about every discretionary recreational expenditure possible so it may take some discipline to ensure that priorities are maintained && balanced successfully among all competing needs && wants).

[10:36] emmy.rowks: "... Yet, you continued even after I said it was a violation to me. That is not respecting me at all. ..."

Wrong.  The equation doesn't just consist of what you say is a violation of you.  I respect you more than you can probably fathom.  I'm giving up on you.  I doubt you'll ever be healthy enough to be on my intellectual level.  You don't read or think or communicate or act carefully.  You have to want to help yourself rather than just limp along off the health of others.  Even though I'm pretty sure you won't be able to see it for years, if ever, I'm still respecting you way more than you know right now because I'm taking great amounts of time && care to conclude our relationship in a thorough way.  I don't dump you on a whim.  I don't really accuse you of unjustified character flaws in public, no matter how much you think so.  It's *you* who doesn't respect yourself or others.  Don't blame me just because I am caring && risky enough to accept invitation into your chaos && to try to make some sense of it.  Maybe, hopefully, someday, you'll be able to make some sense too.  You're seeming far too weak && scared to be worth the top priority on my attention after this e-mail, unless you demonstrate that you're ready to see && do things differently, more honestly, accountably, && balanced, where we're both working carefully together to avoid abusing each other or initiating harmful attacks against the other, whether they be verbal or physical, && also not retaliating with unjustifiable excessive force which escalates issues, when just the minimum force necessary for defensive purposes is all that can be rightly justified if we really care about each other.  That's it!  Not only are you unready to marry or love again, you not even ready to care about me either.  You can't.  You don't have consistent access to that luxury yet.  Wow!  That makes so much sense.  Don't get me wrong.  I know you've tried.  I'm not saying "You never cared" or "You could never truly care."  I'm saying you simply aren't ready to consistently care about anyone but your kids && yourself.  It's unfair, cruel, && emotionally abusive of you to enter relationships in such a state so it's probably good to dissolve ours here if you aren't ready to deal more fairly.

You say I've still never apologized when I think I have several times && can't help but wonder if you're never going to remember or accept any apology as long as you keep periodically slipping back into feeling hurt by me again.  I'm sorry I used the word "suicidal" in a way that you couldn't see past, although it remains true that no words are such sticking points for me so I didn't have the context to understand how profoundly that single word would impact you.  You seemed to understand this earlier... when we discussed my familiarity with hara-kiri (often mispronouced as "harry-carry" in stultified English) or more correctly HTTP://En.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/Seppuku as this is a concept of honor that permeates my entire spiritual understanding.  I have studied Aikido, love Nipponese culture, bushido, swords, anime, movies, technology, sushi, ramen, && video-games.  These concepts of being a dignified principled conscious both spiritual && physical defensive warrior permeate my self-image.  This is my nature.  It has not been hidden from you (including the above time when "suicide" became such a hot-button for you... which I hope you're gradually losing any lingering anxiety over as the concept is prevalent among our society in much more perverted ways that I think belies our general lack of mental health && unpreparedness when attempting to face reality... && please see that I wrote "our society" && "our general" meaning a very broad brush-stroke which should not be taken personally as any insult to you since it is just not meant that way).

While I'm at it, I think you have some justifying or apologizing to do yourself.  This is pasted from your blog:

> maybe I am a romantic. maybe even selfish in that need.
>
> why shouldn’t I expect someone to hold me?
I have held you every time I could that you even hinted that you wanted me to.

> Why shouldn’t I expect someone to help me shoulder
> the weight of everything crushing me down?
Maybe because you're *too* expectant.  You're too demanding, unrealistic, selfish, && imbalanced.  You want help but you are unwilling to help in return.  That is called imbalance or abuse.  You might want to read about it.

> Why do I need to deal with everyones emotions
> all the time?
Because you feel justified in making everyone else deal with your emotions all the time.  Yeah, life isn't fair... but you don't have to make things worse.  You're the one who has a sense of entitlement if all you want to do is take && only give as little as you have to && you do that begrudgingly.  I'm not saying you didn't give generous portions of yourself to me (heart, soul, && body).  I appreciate all that has happened between us.  I've learned a lot... which is just what I'm always after.  As usual, I learned way more about myself than you'd let me learn about you but it wasn't from lack of trying.  I tried to get to know you as gently && sweetly as I possibly could.  None of that was good enough for you, apparently.  Suit yourself.  I've always said you should have things your way in a balanced fashion.  Want me when I want you too, then we should be together.  Not want me or I decide to no longer want you, then we will be apart.  It seems that time has come.  I think we've had all we can.  You're too cruel && insecure for me.  You can't admit that you continue to abuse me by seeing one-sidedness in most of our relational responsibilities.  That's not healthy for either of us.

> Why can’t anyone see how I hurt
How haven't I seen.  Read what I've written here && tell me again that I can't see how you hurt.  I see.  I've done everything I could to help you but you don't care.

> or how I can’t stand with their troubles as well?
Which of my troubles did I force you, or even ask you, to stand with?  Stuff you couldn't handle?  I think you're dreaming to think you're standing under your own weight.  You're still balled in a corner dreaming yourself standing strong already.  I cared enough to share those dreams with you && to shelter you && protect you as well as I could.  I wanted to help resuscitate you, carve out space, clear away enough debris, provide enough encouragement for you to stop sobbing, sit, crawl, && soon stand strong unassisted again.  If you can't even stay sitting by me when I lose my job once again (which I've never hidden as a regular occurrence for me), don't blame that on my lack of sight.  It's really not my fault that you can't stand.  I've been nothing but helpful && patient with you && it looks like slander is my reward... at least until I defend myself by posting every exchange between us && all of the expenditures I've made to prove how horribly imbalanced you wish to keep things.

> I want to wrap myself in a plastic bubble so that
> i am cushioned.
Your emotional "never logical" bubble serves the same purpose... && you're already thoroughly wrapped in many many layers of that.

> I have never felt so hurt and violated.
Is that so?  You're retarded.  If you're telling the truth && you've actually been raped by your ex-husband, you have no right to liken me to him in this way.  I sent e-mails to closest friends && family.  *That* is as hurtful && violating as rape, battering, control, constantly insulting you for things that you're not!?  I may speak harshly with you now because you've attacked me without appropriate justification && even look at my angry, yet still reasoned, defense here.  So far, it's still only between us.  Wow.  I'm still giving you a chance to fix this before I enforce the balance I need.  I need accountability too!  I need justifications for accusations!  If I'm calling you things that sound like names, ask yourself if they're true.  I believe you when you say that your ex-husband is such a hideous man to have forced you to perform sexual favors in exchange for money to care for your kids.  Even though he may want to force you into being his "whore", you are *not* a whore.  He forced that upon you.  Prove to me that it's the same thing when I call you a hypocrite.  I have evidence that you are, without my force.  I haven't forced you to be inconsistent or illogical.  You do that all on your own.  It may hurt you && feel similar but ask yourself where the truth really lies... if you can.

> I guess necause i allowed myself to believe in the words.
I've been a fool to believe your words too.  You spout so much unjustified bullshit.  What words of mine did you allow yourself to believe that you shouldn't have?  Please, cite examples.  There must be many for you to make such a bold claim.  We've got extensive digital copies of our communication histories.  Please just dig a good one up.

> But in the end dont actions always speak louder than mere words.
Finally you say something worthwhile.

> I value my privacy above so many other things,
> and in the end that is what was used against me.
Ah, yeah, because privacy is necessary for you to maintain your selfish imbalance so that you can propagate the abuse cycle... or so you can be secretly abused behind closed doors by someone less like me && more like Ian.  By the way, have you read his three e-mails to me?  I consider them far worse && more aggressive, threatening, && crass than anything I've ever written to either of you.

> I wanted to believe in it.
You keep foolishly wanting to believe in the unreal because none of your romance novels are bounded by any realistic constraints.  You're just gone.

> I wanted to be swept off my feet and loved,
> but i didn’t realize that i’d be left to fall.
You dropped yourself.  Not my fault.

> I have learned my lesson. If it seems too good to be true, it is.
Here's a harder lesson for you:  Just because it seems true to you doesn't mean it is.

> The broken promises to both my kids and myself is what

What promises have I made && broken?

> I feel so badly… for him.
Save your pity.  If you were mentally healthier && able to assess things more honestly, you'd be able to admit that I am mentally healthier than you... && that that's okay.  That doesn't mean you suck or I'm better than you or any bullshit like that.  It doesn't mean that it gives me any right to always "throw it in your face" or manipulate you or control you with it... but it can be a real truth that we should come to terms with in order to address in a healthy candid fashion... so that someday, it won't be the case anymore (i.e., somday we will *both* be so mentally healthy && stable that there will remain no discernible disparity between us).  Trust me.  You are free to feel badly for me whenever you wish but I really have never needed you to or asked you to... anymore than a willingness to hug me as supportively && sincerely as you can, whenever life becomes particularly rough... which is something I've remained eager to do for you.

> He has no concept how far from reality he has slipped,
Seriously, this is such bullshit.  Where the fuck is any of your evidence?  I know you think you're all emotional so there can be no logic but you talk a pretty good game about the scientific method.  Prove to me, inspire even the tiniest shadow of doubt about my deficient concept, measure how far it has slipped from your perfect notion of reality please.  You are the one who's off her rocker with this crap.

> or how sanity is so far left of him.
Prove it.  I need evidence or your argument is hollow which makes you the one who is far removed from sanity.  Refute my logic, if you can... or continue to expect that your uninformed && unjustified clinical diagnoses of me will be met with harsh fucking prejudice because you don't understand how I think.  If you did, even the tiniest bit, you wouldn't bandy about so many baseless accusations without a single ounce of verifiable evidence.  If you claim to have a logical argument, evidence, reason... I am totally all ears.  If you convince me that I am wrong or insane, that my concept of reality is off in any small or large way, please don't hesitate to bring it to my attention.  If you're attacking my character reflexively, without justification, know that you're betraying my trust publicly too.  Prove my insanity publicly if you like.  Don't make shit up.  That's cowardly.  Can you even give me one fucking link to something I've written online that was at all negative toward you?  I may have drafted lengthy e-mails to our closest family && friends which discussed the potential for those to be posted to my blog... but you know what, you're the one who is escalating things.  You scolded a child today "Retaliation is never acceptable!"  I made a carefully reasoned decision to seek out our closest most trustworthy audience, which you suggest you haven't even had time to read much of.  You're being a hypocrite yet again.  You say I publicized your private life but give me the URL.  It's not fucking there.  You're fucking stupid.  Why have I wasted so much time on your dumb ass.  I knew that whole fucking forgetfulness with "never logic to emotions, you know that" bullshit that I've of course never said or known was a red flag.  You're abusing me && you've been too abused to see it.  You want privacy so that you won't be humiliated for abusing me.  You claim everyone else should be accountable but you're too private to be accountable.  I have to admit that you *do* love your children dearly && you have way more at stake than I do so your trust of me is much more significant than mine of you.  I've made so many accessions for you  I've been so tolerant && patient with your flip-flopping between logic && denial.  You got fed up && now that I'm re-reading your blog, it totally pisses me off how imbalanced you want to keep things between us.  You're making me fed up with your tendency to blow things out-of-proportion, overreact, project your shortcomings on everyone around you, try to defend you own inconsistency, unreasonability, && lack of disclosure or accountability while damning everyone else for theirs.  I thought I could hang with you but you leave this bullshit up on your blog.  Fuck you.  You're way too heartless for me.  Look me up after you're really ready not to be in an abusive relationship.  I'm too accustomed to being abused by eccentric women.  I've gotta break this cycle too.

You haven't proven I'm a drug addict either.  I have way more evidence that you exhibit addictive behaviors with cigarettes, coffee, && maybe also food than I've ever exhibited with cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, MDMA, heroin, PCP, crack, or any of the other drugs I've taken with exquisite control throughout my life.  Evidence.  Gather some.

> He uses his intellect as a shield to abuse, bully, manipulate,
> and hurt those surrounding him.
Maybe my intellect is so significant that people can't help but abuse themselves around me.  Prove that I've bullied, manipulated, or hurt.  When?  Where?  How?  I think you should be able to handle such basic principles, even in your damaged state.  If you can't, well you're really far too immature then to be publicly arriving at such conclusions when you don't have substance.  Even this paragraph is defending my fucking self!  You call it bullying if you like.  I am fucking defensive warrior.  You attack me then claim I'm manipulating you.  You are pathetic coward who can't even stand in my presence.  You've been hurt by others && keep hurting yourself && when I tell you this truth, you say I'm hurting you more.  I'm sick of pussy-footing around you so gently.  I thought I should treat you delicately because I can see how wounded you are but when you keep stabbing me in the back while I'm carrying you to safety... well you can't be that surprised if at some point I've just lost so much blood that I have to dump you in search of someone who really wants me as a companion.

> He thinks that he is the smartest person on the planet, but
> even by saying so he shows how far from the mark he truly is.
Wrong && wrong again!  I have a lot of evidence to support that I'm one of the smartest people on the planet.  You have presented no evidence to the contrary.  Do so before you imply my supposition is invalid.  Just because most people are idiots && idiots have such poor judgment, are so unjustifiably arrogant, deluded into thinking themselves grand when they are not... that is not sufficient proof that grand people do not exist.  If I think generally faster && more clearly && deeply than the vast majority of people alive today (which could be tested rather objectively, wouldn't you agree?), then it's rather logical to assume I could also be perceptive && thoughtful enough to recognize the actual fact of my intellectual superiority.  Just because a significant portion of insane people think they are Jesus or a President (alive or dead) ot the United States or Elvis, this does not mean that those original greats are fake too.  Just because most physically abusive men are eager to trap any vulnerable woman && appear willing to commit their hearts in an instant, it does not logically follow that all men who would commit their hearts in an instant are necessarily physical abusers.  There might be an immense union on those two issues, but there will remain small crescents on each side which describe members belonging to either camp but not the other (assuming a distribution graph of overlapping circles as commonly found in set-theory).

> I’ve never really had to deal with someone who was so
> vicious and demeaning all the time,
Look in the fucking mirror.

> but especially when someone “puts him down.”
I have never pretended otherwise.  I am defensive!  Can you hear?  Defense!  Defense!  You must justify yourself, communicate clearly, argue convincingly, match my fucking wit or at least make an effort... if you ever hope to put me down.  I defend myself && I'm generous enough to defend others too.  You spit on my defense.  Well I spit on your illogical offense.  Think about it.

> He claimed to love me, yet then sent words upon words
> of how ruined, broken, etc., I am/was to all my family
> and friends
Are you ruined or broken?  In some ways yes, others not so.  Have I ever said otherwise?  Can you prove I haven't loved you?  My love for you is fading fast while wrangling with your blog here.  You *are* fucking broken!  You have no concept of balance.  You don't understand the most basic distinction between defense && offense.  You think any warrior should be feared implicitly because of their familiarity with weaponry.  You are senseless in these ways.

> in an effort to ruin my relationships, and gain support for
> his selfish and unhealthy desire to be with just anyone.
Are you sure that was what my effort was towards?  Ruining your relationships?  Evidence?  Which relationships have I ruined?  Which ones can you even prove I was intending to damage in any way.  You can't handle the truth.  You can't handle the accountability of scrutiny.  You are the selfish unhealthy one who can only point her fragile finger && blame her helpers for her own suffering.  You've exhausted my patience.  Now you get lashed with my defensive tongue, if you can even read or think still.  If you attacked me physically, I'd restrain you.  Restrict you from hurting me or yourself any further than necessary.  This is also precisely what I've always tried to do with my words.  You're blind && dumb about all of this.  See && learn, please.  How many times can I extend more patience, pleading with you?  You insult yourself by referring to yourself as "just anyone."  I chose to be with you for many reasons that I've already elaborated upon.  Apparently you're proving that your good qualities, as appealing as they may be, become rather bitter after you give yourself over to your private abusive tendencies.  You are the unjustified aggressor.  Give evidence to the contrary.  Justify anything.  You just never fucking do.  You could, if you cared to... if you meant it when you said you wanted to break free from abuse... but you're so selfish right now, you'd really rather abuse me than stop real abuse.  Hopefully you'll see this someday.  Keep our e-mails.  I think this e-mail is the end of my rope with you.  You need to recognize what has happened && our mutual culpability in all of it, && I require that be accompanied by a humbled intention to stop abusing others when they tell you you're being the worse aggressor, you're the one who is retaliating excessively, you're the one who is being irrational, not communicating clearly, not having time to justify any of her hurtful actions... or you can find some other poor sap to take mental beatings from you with little hope that you'll ever become aware of your hypocrisy.  As I said with that first struck out e-mail, I used to give women three chances to mistreat me before I consciously balanced things or walked away.  Due to your circumstances, I decided to extend you seven additional chances... but you still haven't even said whether we're together or not anymore, even though I've asked before.  Apparently you're too busy for meaningless details like where we stand.  Well I'll stick to my word.  I'm giving you the original 3 + 7 added days, so it's Sunday, November 11th of 2007 today.  You have until Wednesday, November 21st to either recognize your own abusiveness && my overwhelmingly genuine defensiveness... or you will have proven that I was mistaken about us ever hoping to have a worthwhile future together.  I know we are each under a lot of pressure && have other concerns && considerations right now.  That's exactly why we should focus on being our best under strain rather than use that as an excuse to justify establishing or reinforcing abusive patterns between us, in either direction.

> Then he turns around and talks about himself and how
> wonderful *he* is, and how I am being destructive of
> *our* loving and healthy relationship.
We are both wonderful && destructive.  You are the one who has discarded our relationship thrice with little justification.  I am prepared to do so now, amidst immense justification that all you intend to do is live an imbalanced life with or without me... no matter how clearly I point it out to you.  I think I have loved you && you've been honest that you haven't been healthy... you're not healthy && therefore not ready to love yourself or anyone but your kids in any reasonable way yet.  We both deserve better than that.  Heal.  Be accountable.  I'm willing to.  Justify your accusations.  See clearly.  Think carefully.  Decide fairly.

> Love is unselfish,
Name one instance of my inappropriate selfishness.  When && where?

Besides that, you're such a decrepit heartless unromantic shrew if you expect selfless love from a dreamy wonderful successful intelligent man... while you refuse to love or let go of your admitted selfishness at all!  Hypocrite!  I never should've let you ride my motorcycle.  You can't balance for shit.

> love comes without pride or ego.
How do you know that?  You couldn't possibly know anything of the sort.  You're floundering with a broken mind to think this.  Healthy people are proud of themselves && their love.  Ego can be healthy confidence or aggressive oppressive spirit.  I don't think you are fit to know about these truths yet... && you may never recover enough to grasp this.

> That is the kind of love I eventually want.
Then keep looking for what you want.  I hope it exists for you... && can eventually be found or will find you.  Just be warned that you might be chasing something completely imaginary.  You might be throwing away the closest you'll get with me too.  I know this sounds arrogant but I think it's true enough to deserve mention.  It's not meant as a threat.  It's meant as an informative reminder of a likelihood that I imagine, knowing that my limited perspective must always remain biased about myself since, as long as I remain attentive, I must also always remain better informed about myself than anyone I could compare myself to.  I can only judge thoughts && intentions by words && actions, as everyone does... but knowing so well all four of those that have been mine, I see vivid contrast already between the words && actions of almost everyone else I've encountered.  Judge for yourself.  You said I "sent words upon words."  I am prolific in thought && writing.  I care about words && I use them to learn to think better && faster.  Call that bad if you must.

> Not this kind of love that is clearly for what I can
> be/do for him, his life, his goals, his dreams, or his ego.
Fuck you.  You're being such bitch with this bullshit.  Give me one fucking piece of evidence that my "kind of love" has been "clearly for what [you could] be/do for [me, my] life, [my] goals, [my] dreams, or [my] ego."  There must still be shrapnel && shards of glass lodged in your shivering heart if you're going to disparage my voiced or concealed goals && dreams for us together.  You're the one who has poisoned us with imbalance.  I have pleaded, reasoned, && argued until I've been blue-in-the-face.  Balance && defense.  You don't understand those.  You can't.  I'm sorry it has to come to this boundary of mine, this line-in-the-sand, this ultimatum if you must see it that way.  Prove to me that you understand defense && balance && that you have any genuine intention of establishing or maintaining the latter with me.  Otherwise, we really have to be through.  Just distant friends.  The world is full of healthier women that could easily appreciate && treat me better than you're doing... although I don't know if any woman will ever be able to understand how much more deeply my thoughts go than my words && actions have thus far been able to convey.  You have given me glimmers of hope that your enormous intellectual capacity just requires more conducive circumstances to emerge && thrive healthily but you've undone so much with this retaliatory crap.  I've justified myself.  You haven't.  Balance.  Find some or I have to be done with you.  Sorry.  It's for both of our good, ultimately.

> I am scared now,
Liar.  You're *always* scared.

> because he has mentioned weapons so many times.
If you became exceptionally scared at the "now" time of when you wrote your post, well your fear really is your fault.  I have never threatened you or your children with any physical violence.  You imagine that I have done so && by writing that to the world, you slander my character without any justification or evidence other than my justifiable familiarity with weapons.  I am defensive.  I know most authority figures tend to abuse their power so there is some logic in fearing anyone who values weapons... but until the world is entirely peaceful, I think you'll have a hard case to make to say that good, smart, conscious, reliable, trustworthy, defensive, peace-loving people should not know about, care about, or possess weapons.  Should a good trustworthy honorable police officer be considered exceptionally scary because he mentioned his pistol many times?  No.  It is a tool... just as you're being in response to your illogical unjustifiable fears.  You have to decide && act to be good.  What if I made up unjustified shit about your suicidal tendencies, drug abuse, && child abuse on my blog, huh?  I would never, *never* do any such thing.  It's *not* a threat.  It's trying to give you perspective on what you're doing to me.  I'm defending myself.  You should either take those posts down or add evidence to them because they're fucking bullshit right now.

> Claims to have all kinds of professional knowledge of them,
When && where && specifically what did I claim?  "Professional"?  Are you fucking kidding me?

> and here I sit just a mom of 5 kids. I am in fear. Deep bone set fear.
Yep... as you have been && as you shall remain... as long as you decide to.  I have nothing to do with that condition of yours.  You're not paying attention to the details that matter.  You're focusing on all the most terrifying ones && incapacitating yourself, wounding those that would volunteer to assist you.  If you really want to become unafraid, to heal, to progress, decide to think, reason, && change.  If you have evidence of why I've instilled "deep bone set fear" in you, let's hash it out on your blog or in e-mail or on the phone.  If you don't have evidence, don't scapegoat me for your fear.

> But then he turns and makes himself into a victim of *my*
> abuse when ever I disagreed with him, or voiced my opinion
> or anger at his quasi hurtful love.
Oh yeah.  You could never be the abuser.  Oh never.  You've been too abused to ever abuse anyone else.  Of course.  Disagree with me whenever you wish.  I invite it.  I welcome it.  Do it intelligently though... or don't even pretend to dignify it as a disagreement.  You have to justify your opinion... && your anger with me.  I aim to keep you accountable or not keep you at all.  You don't need me.  Neither do I need you.  I'm ready to dump your dumb hypocritical ungrateful ass.

> I am so very sad for him.
I'll bet.  Cry me a river.

> I really hope that he directs his attentions elsewhere
> so that I can feel safe again.
You're making sure that I do... but mark my words... any feeling of safety that comes over you after I'm gone will be your own delusion && false sense of security.  I have never posed any physical threat to you.  Prove otherwise or just keep cowering && stabbing outward with your eyes shut whenever anyone approaches you with a blanket.  I'm sure that'll keep working really well.

> Although, what he truly needs is serious long term therapy.
Right.  I'm the one among us who you are confident is in seriously greater need of "long term therapy" because, yeah I just sustained && emerged from *13* years of marital physical abuse.  How unlucky a number.  Thanks for your clinical opinion of what I truly need.  I'm glad to undergo therapy if it can be reasonably justified as anything but a waste of my time.  I've had several therapists throughout my life.  As you might imagine (or you might be too busy or incapable but maybe you could try anyway), most of them were complete ignoramuses compared to me.  I was surprised half of them could tie their own shoes so I didn't even try to cause us both to suffer me trying to explain myself to them.  You're of course projecting badly here again.  You need long-term therapy much worse && far more urgently than me.

> I think his family had it right on this one. He has a really
> scary God-complex combined with an addiction to drugs
> and risky behavior that seems to convince himself he is
> above the rest. *sigh* I wish him wellness of mind.
Prove any of that.  I don't believe even the wish at the end.  You're too cruel.  I'm sick of this charade that you want health, love, balance, responsibility.  Maybe your ex-husband makes the worst abuser, liar, controller, manipulator, batterer, egotist, spouse, && parent amongst the three of us.  Who is really coming in second?  If you genuinely think it's me, you must prove it.  Compare us.  If you can't, you have the benefit of keeping yourself in the dark && continuing to conclude whatever you wish to... but there's very little likelihood that you're right or able to make good decisions under those adverse conditions, some of which you are voluntarily sustaining out of yet again unjustifiable fear.

I have so spared you my intellectual wrath before now.  I've redirected my most fierce verbal expressive anger && creativity toward Ian && my father (who pissed me off enough to give up on any remaining hope I've had that he could ever understand or support me in the way I've needed... && I didn't even tell you about this before to shield you from concerning yourself with more of how upset this all has made me).  You've provoked me && I've withstood it graciously for too long now.  It's your turn.  You've attacked me on your blog far worse than anything I've ever done to you.  You've lied up && down about me to Ian obviously.  Probably also to everyone else.  You probably don't even remember or know any truths about me anymore because your fear has forced you to reimagine almost everything as part of your best attempt to preserve yourself from any more hurting (&& you can't distinguish emotional from physical or couldn't be bothered to anyway).  The only good thing I think I can say about it is that you didn't explicitly mention my name there (even though everyone who knows either of us will know you're claiming or implying all sorts of unfair things about me).  Well I can still play that blog game too... && I'm pretty fucking meticulous with communications so... I think the world could pretty easily see just about everything that has transpired between us in the past two months.  Forget our parents or siblings or friends.  The whole interested United-Statesian-English-speaking world can judge who's insane among us, who is loving, who is generous, who is manipulative, who is accountable, who is abusive, who is cowardly, who is strong, who is gentle, who is defensive, etc..  I can easily substitute out all names with references to $man && $woman (&& $mother_of_woman, $neice, $friend, etc.) just to preserve some balance, to remind you that I continue to *respond* to you.  I respond to your kindness && your resentment.  I continue to defend myself with reason.  Do you really want to battle me like this?  I've been on your side but you're pressing your attack.  I've been so damn patient.  Time's almost up.

We've been brought to this real crossroads.  I refuse to continue alongside you unless you can understand && seek better balance with me.  You have ten days, until a week from Wednesday, deadline November 21st to reply via e-mail or call me to convince me.  Until you're ready to do that, I don't want to hear from you.  You've treated me way too shamefully && you've kept claiming I'm the one who hasn't apologized enough.  Fuck apologies for what I did amount our most trusted.  Take down your false accusations about me that are really public... or just keep living in your insane imbalance, unreasonably accusing everyone else of all the awful things you are so that you never have to face yourself.

Please hear me: I'm sick && tired of being abused too!  It's not okay for anyone to attack crazily without justification.  Find balance or find someone else to fuck over.  Don't describe me as a coward to anyone.  Cowards don't buck authority, don't race motorcycles or cars at high speeds, don't love deeply, && don't get together with women in your situation.  I remain probably the bravest man you've ever had the privilege of knowing.  Look at Ian's communications with me or how your ex-husband deals with me to see how a real coward acts.  I won't keep being your bitch like this.  Make your choice whether you are willing to seek a better balance with me or whether you're better off without me because those are the only two options I can accept from you anymore.

&& dedicated all sorts of time to attempts to give you insight into
who your son has become && why.  If you can't be involved in my life
as it really is, then you're the one who needs to "STOP IT."  You've
never been involved in my life as the consistently gently healthy
loving father that I've needed.  I'll stop trying to teach you that.
You don't care to learn how to have a balanced relationship with me
either.  Shove off old man.  If you'll never be a capable fatherly
companion for me, I simply don't have time to waste struggling to read
any more of your hollow words, whether strained through horribly
broken-down teeth && dreams or banged out on your keyboard.  I still
don't hate you... any more than this whole stupid heartless world that
you resemble more than me (&& which I still couldn't think you great
enough to be responsible for in any direct sense).  Fuck off, Gerry.
Your address is being removed, as per your empty && impolite command
that this be done.  Let me know when you're dead, because I imagine
I'll like to share your company more then.  Your negative worth really
astonishes me.  Fuck you for everything, you pathetic ulcerated
asshole.  I'm done casting my pearls before swine like you.  You can
burn your misguided fucking birthday cards.  I wanted a G-d-damn
relationship with someone who could care, not hollow token gestures.
I've never needed you to do anything other than protect && nurture me
until I could fend for myself.  Thanks for participating poorly in
getting me there.  Now you've rendered yourself nothing to me.
Another broke blind speechless bum in Pennsylvania.  Farewell Dad.  I
hope you got what you've wanted from our shambles of a relationship...
because I sure didn't && have run out of grace, hope, && patience.
It's too bad.  I really thought you could be somebody.  You're not
intelligent or honest... so you can no longer have the privilege of
associating with someone as brilliant as me.  I've got too many great
dreams to progress towards to continue much further with all this
romantic fervor && futility, trying to uplift the dregs of society.
I've thought myself an outcast who would find kinship && understanding
among the fringes, && my chances admittedly have been better there
than among the mainstream... but they're clarifying as similarly
dismal still.  I have many good friends who have worthwhile opinions
&& care to improve themselves && me.  We relate well together, with
reasonable levels of balance.  Practice bicycle-riding && concentrate
on all that is involved because I refuse to teach you anything
further.  You're on your own now... just as I've always known I am,
thanks to your fabulous parenting.  I've seriously spent all my love
for you right now.  I don't know if more could be earned.  I guess it
wasn't boundless && unconditional afterall.  Huh.  That's pretty
interesting.  Maybe we'll meet again somewhere, somehow, Mr. Stuart.
Sayonara.

Sincerely,
-Pip Super (I think I want to change my last name since the old one
has become cheap && shoddy.)
