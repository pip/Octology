Hi Emmy,

I know how convenient it is for you to omit all the most relevant details so I will just keep on keepin' on.  Let me provide some citations to clarify the context of each of your complaints.  You've claimed you wanted mutual accountability.  You're the one among us who really can't handle it.  I have our history of e-mails to prove that my character has remained consistent.  You have been consistently less thoughtful or communicative, crueler under pressure, more inconsistent, selfish, manipulative, && emotional.  Am I supposed to lie?  Am I supposed to pretend I no longer care or never did or that I have been anything but generous, kind, patient, sensitive, && generally too gentle with you?

> I have refrained from the conversation but disrespecting my mother
So many incredible accusations?!  Specifically when && how have I disrespected your mother in any way that she hadn't already disrespected me similarly?  What's good for the goose...?  I'm aiming for just a smidgen of balance.  Is it really too much to ask?

> when you claim to love me,
I definitely claim to love you.  I do love you, with my full heart, as purely && well as I possibly can.

> and even asked me to marry you
When did I do this?  How?  I know you && I have discussed the concept of marriage several times && I've mentioned casually (even once when your parents were over) that I'd be willing to marry if you were ever interested in pursuing such a course... but it seems we're both totally unraveling that willingness now.  Let's be accountable, Em.  Let's let our record show who we are, who we have been together, who we can become together.  I am still willing to be together with you.  Let's be accountable together, please.

> is a bit at odds to your words.
I really don't think so.

> I am feeling that you have betrayed my trust,
I know you're feeling that way but look deeper && see that I am making myself even more trustworthy to you.

> as well as continuing to put me down while expounding upon
We *both* deserve to be put down && expounded upon.  We are both just flawed people who also *rowk*!  You can see this.

> all of your supposed finer qualities.
Are you seriously saying I don't have fine qualities?  I've constantly adored your myriad fine qualities.  You are awesome to me.  You don't need to hide or feel awkward.  Let's refine our finer qualities.

> That is the exact type of manipulation and verbal abuse I was

Are you sure?  How have I manipulated you or verbally abused you?  Please make this clear to me because I'm reading these books && I'm just not seeing me in them.

> It is probably the same type of abuse you were reading in my
> book that you said reminded you of yourself.
As I pointed out in the e-mail that began this whole public spectacle, I think it's a valid criticism that abusive men resemble loving ones in several ways, as a deceptive tactic.

> I believe you said psychological abuse/manipulation.
I remain open to consider && correct any possible avenue of abuse or unwelcome manipulation (or stimulation ;) ).

> Please feel free to keep the book.
Thanks.  Please feel free to keep whatever I brought there.  I have also just recovered your hard-drive, enclosure, && cables from my Apple-geek friend who has been thus far unsuccessful in attempting to recover your original data.  I will be shipping those items directly to you tomorrow if I am able, or by Monday at the latest.  Please let me know if you require them be overnighted or if the cheapest shipping option would be acceptable under my financial circumstances.  I'd also like to let you know that Chris, your landlord, called me asking what was going on because neither you nor your ex-husband were returning any of his calls again.  I briefly explained that you had dumped me && stopped being responsive to me so I really didn't know how much I could do anything further from all the way down here in L.A..  I said he should probably just keep trying to reach you.  He said he needed to start filing your eviction summons immediately.  I told him that I would definitely be back in touch with him as soon as I could possibly find another job that would enable me to pay your rent (even knowing you might remain unwilling to engage me at all in any form of communication anymore).  I'll keep reading, with an open-mind toward my own culpability && that of your ex-husband... && also that of you.  We can't survive with completely one-sided accusations or accountability.  Sometimes there is a right or wrong... && sometimes you gloss over the critical details to prove a mistaken point.  It is totally your prerogative to hate me for being able to point out those details && for doing so tirelessly.  You could always hate me for anything you choose.  I wouldn't force you to love me or stop hating me.  Please keep doing whatever you think is right.  That is just what I'm doing too.

> I am amazed that while you were informing everyone of our personal

Sorry but no, I didn't.  You have completely entirely cruelly missed the *major* point of my first big e-mail.  It stated that you had dumped me completely, three consecutive times, without any reasonable explanation.  I was asking you to please hurt me in any other way but to stop dumping me over small matters.  This event may have mushroomed into a monumental event that clouds our hindsight on the matter but I have e-mails which show that you keep misunderstanding things horribly && you are seeming only barely able to listen to any reason.  I can't tell whether you're doing it on purpose but I can keep repeating that our communications can easily be exposed to keep us honest && accountable for our actions.  You've started blogging with unjustified accusations about our history together.  I am feeling increasingly justified to resurrect my blog && post our history together (of course only after editing out anything that identifies you or your kids in ways that are any more telling that what you've already posted to your Flickr account).  I remain willing to be accountable for my actions.  This is not a threat.  It is simple truth.  Who we have been together is largely documented since we've been mostly distant.  I'm really not trying to be a prick about this but I *am* upset && I think I have every right to be.  I don't see evidence of how I've abused you, other than with so much open honesty that you felt betrayed.  I think that's *you* abusing you.  I'm really convinced that hiding ourselves only enables us to harm each other.  Care to not harm each other?  I really do.


> Turning around to involve everyone in your anger at me
Who is angry?  I may be angry with your dimwit buddy, Ian, for threatening to "fuck [me] up BIG time" even though I have only protected you considerately && generously.

Oh really?  I'm not convinced.  Care to explain how... on any of that stuff?

What is that supposed to mean?  Is that some veiled accusation that I forced myself upon you sexually?!  I did no such thing!  Seriously, do you have any proof that I forced you to go "faster" or "deeper" than you were willing to go in anything?  I don't think you do.  I am really just fine with showing everything to anyone who could be bothered to judge.  You said people don't take responsibility for their actions.  You said go fast && I did.  You said go slow && I did.  I let you set the fucking pace.  You did.  You played with me.  We played together.  When you didn't mention your boundaries or preferences, I carefully described mine to you.  I conveyed my desires && intentions.  I asked permission on every approach.  I manipulated && forced nothing.  Please tell me a single time that I did anything different.  I really know of not one.  What do you mean about me going "supposedly" fast or deep?  Do you really mean to face down these heart-felt pages && pages of carefully thought-out text with an accusation that I'm only faking my speed && depth?  I just don't see evidence for that either.  I knew I could go way faster than you... so I gave you throttle control... explicitly... demonstrably.  Have you forgotten?  Do you not realize that it's still in your hand?  You're letting it go.  If it falls back to me, I might not feel I can trust you to hold my heart again like this.  I know it must sound like an awful threat to your poor frightened mind.  I'm really not insulting you by pointing out truthfully what's happening either, even if it sounds like that.  I am clearly communicating my own boundaries && enforcing them... just as I have thoroughly obeyed all of your boundaries that we have discussed, understood, && agreed upon.  You have also had all sorts of boundaries that you've never been willing or able to communicate about.  As I have said before, I've explored most of those very carefully && have obeyed them as well as I could, even though it has been a mine-field of sorts.  You focus on drama or truth as problem or insult... when they just weren't.  It's okay to be wounded.  We're fucking human.  Get over your facade of strength.  We're only in front of our parents && my step-sister now anyway.  Who can you trust?!  Can you really trust nobody?  Can nobody in this whole world trust me purely either, no matter how little evidence ever condemns me?  Show me where I'm wrong && I will become better, for you!  You have done it before && I have changed quickly.

> I am just finally getting on my feet after an abusive 12 year
> marriage.
I think that is relatively well understood by all.  Are you mentioning this seriously because you have any reason to think my behavior or words have suggested to you that I didn't know this fact?

> I had told you several times of my boundaries and needs.
Such as?  When?  What was my response?

> You failed to listen to me several times.
Again, when?  How?  Let's see.  I'm sorry but I'm too honest not to call your bluff here.  I really love you this much.  I am proving it to you, even if you will never be healthy enough to see it for what it is, to appreciate it, to embrace me joyously ever again.  I must love you.  It is what I have chosen to become.  Just peek around your eyelids && you will see.

> You do not understand the amount of responsibilities
> I must meet everyday.
How have I not understood?  Have I really helped out with your everyday responsibilities less than you, each time I found myself invited into your home?  Shall we compare notes?

> I am not for you.
I wish you wouldn't conclude this but I can accept it if you do.  Neither of us have needed each other.  We still don't.  I got a juice smoothie yesterday && followed up on job leads, hung out with my best friend, ate fine ramen && sushi, rolled && smoked imported cigarettes, listened to music, talked nerd stuff, played Street Fighter with my brother when he arrived, hugged both of them long && hard because I love both very much && sometimes life gets pretty damn rough, ate a great dinner, got up && played tennis with my roommate, && then wrote a kick-ass fucking in-your-face e-mail that was so highly intellectual that it would probably be incredibly educational to most readers.  I think it will have to be posted to my blog, since I'm all about accountability.

> My children come first in my life no matter what.
I have always known that.  I have repeated that back to you many times.  I have never doubted that or gone against it.  Your children have become first in my life too so that you could be a very close second.  Mine cannot be "no matter what" though.  If you don't want me around them or you because my intelligence has become terrifying to you, well I can only oblige you... but I'm going to do so with my characteristic honest precision.  Sorry to scold you a bit like this but it's an old adage that maybe you can learn from now.  Be very careful what you wish for (e.g., honest accountability)... because you just might get it.

I really can reconstruct these events.  I may have foolishly used the words "depressed" && "suicidal" around you at a time when you could not accurately judge whether they were employed as honest descriptions of valid sensations that were very fleeting or whether they were overwhelming conditions that had become deep treacherous afflictions.  I thought we could be honest with each other about mood-changes as they progress.  I don't have wild mood-swings.  I harbor copious rage against unjust, ill-gotten, && inane authority && I control it very carefully.  Maybe you don't know me well enough or you're just too reactionary && insecure yourself to be dealt with so honestly.  I didn't know how you would take my words.  Had I known, I hope it's very clear to everyone that I wouldn't have precipitated this intentionally.  I genuinely didn't know you would react anywhere near this way.  It is unfortunate that you didn't give me the response I was hoping for because I thought maybe you'd be compassionate && encouraging, understanding of how badly I've wanted warm hugs from people who care about me.  Instead, you turned black && imagine that I could possibly play blackmail games with you.  What am I trying to blackmail from you, if that's the case?  Huh?  Your voluntary love?  That can't be blackmailed sweets.  Can I blackmail you in the plain sight of our parents?  I doubt it.

I will lead up to that very "suicidal" context to show you that you had, && still have, no valid argument about me becoming depressed or suicidal in any significant sense.  I wasn't when I used those words (as I believe context will show) && I'm still not.  Let's explore, shall we?  I'm seriously going to catch us up here.

I got fired from Trilogy Studios on Tuesday, November 6th in the late afternoon / early evening, around 4:30pm.  I collected my belongings, loaded my car (after having driven straight down from Sacramento that morning, directly to work, blanky still in my car), rolled a cigarette, smoked && began the following exchange:

-- right after being fired on Tuesday evening:

2007-11-06 19:19 Pip: Busy?
2007-11-06 20:33 Emmy: Not right now
2007-11-06 20:33 Emmy: Why?
2007-11-06 20:41 Pip: I am eager to talk.
2007-11-06 20:41 Emmy: Oh?  Something going on?  Everything ok?
2007-11-06 20:44 Pip: Yeah.
2007-11-06 20:45 Emmy: Call the house phone

-- we discussed my having been fired over the phone, as well as the likelihood of me returning to be with you the following day to conduct my job-search closer to you, whom I love.  I said we should both sleep on that possibility && that you should let me know if you have misgivings about that plan, for any reason, because I truly haven't wanted to impose, then Wednesday morning follows:

2007-11-07 07:20 Emmy: Sometimes u are so crass and gross
2007-11-07 07:21 Pip: How?
2007-11-07 07:38 Emmy: What u said on the phone.  The reason I hung up.  I am not one of those people who don't mind crassness.  I mind it very much.
2007-11-07 07:42 Pip: What did I say that was so crass?
2007-11-07 07:47 Emmy: I don't even want to repeat it

-- then Wednesday afternoon:

2007-11-07 14:16 Pip: Hi sweets.  How are ya?
2007-11-07 14:15 Emmy: Hey
2007-11-07 14:16 Emmy: Maybe right now isn't a good time to come up.  I am stressed out.  I am not feeling good either.  Jack is sick, and claire is getting whatever it is too.
2007-11-07 16:35 Pip: K.  I understand.  Please let me know when would be better.  I miss you.  I hope you all feel better soon. (*Note*: This message was sent within minutes after the above one but was not delivered due to deficient signal strength, which is why the time-stamp reflects when it could be re-sent && delivered two hours later, although it continues to reside in my phone in this very event order, message-wise, that I've reconstructed here by interleaving our messages as meticulously as I can.)

2007-11-07 15:07 Emmy: U there?
2007-11-07 15:28 Pip: Yeah.
2007-11-07 16:16 Emmy: What is going on?
2007-11-07 16:25 Pip: Not much.  I'm just listening to music and looking for jobs or e-mailing friends here or there.  What's going on with you?
2007-11-07 16:27 Emmy: Was wondering why u didn't respond to my earlier text message
2007-11-07 16:34 Pip: Oh?  Maybe I didn't get it or my reply couldn't find a signal to be delivered.  Half of your texts to me today haven't made my phone beep the arrival notice tone.  I'm not sure why but I'm not all that surprised if everything is messed up for a while either.
2007-11-07 16:35 Pip: K.  I understand.  Please let me know when would be better.  I miss you.  I hope you all feel better soon.  (*Note*: I've re-pasted the original message here, where it was re-sent, && finally successfully delivered, as this provides thorough context.)
2007-11-07 16:36 Pip: Yeah.  Reply didn't get through.  Just resent it.  TTYL

-- at this point, I'm pretty sure I had left my house to go to the bank to cash my final paycheck from Trilogy before it closed.  Trilogy gave me no severance && basically left me high-&&-dry.  I think this next set of questions arrived while I was heading to my Washington Mutual bank branch:

2007-11-07 16:38 Emmy: What do u miss?
2007-11-07 16:39 Emmy: Everything is messed up for a while?
2007-11-07 16:41 Emmy: Am I bothering u?
2007-11-07 16:47 Pip: All of you, your hugs, smiles, warmth, kisses, tickles, eyes, voice, touch, walk, sex, glances, awkwardness, conversations, appreciation, sleeping, smoking, reading, listening, playing, watching, eating, driving, sipping, licking... ;)

-- Note that I intentionally delayed responding to the latter two questions above until I could return home && e-mail their responses (at 18:51 below).  I had wanted to go buy sushi (right next to my WaMu branch) but I headed over to In-N-Out Burger a few blocks away instead.  I saw a homeless man camped on the sidewalk on my way there so I asked out my window if he wanted In-N-Out for dinner, a Double-Double.  He affirmed && I returned to consume a warm meal with him.  We shared some of our respective histories && wisdoms with each other while enjoying our good food.  We shared cigarettes too.  She texted me the following while I was relaxing on the sidewalk chatting with Dave:

2007-11-07 17:42 Emmy: What about something specific to just me?0

-- which was my cue to wrap things up && discard Dave's trash, thank him for sharing dinner with me, gave him $50 && my pouch of tobacco, shook his hand, && said I wish him well && hope to see him again.  Hanging with Dave had made me feel like things were gonna be fine but then that IM made me feel sad again while heading home.  I responded to that message using e-mail when I got into my room because my mobile phone's reliability is so poor && I only ever feel willing to type so much on that infernal phone's tiny stupid keypad because I love you so much:

Yeah.  My mom went to the Emergency Room twice last week for a
mysterious pain in her face, your ex is fucking shit up again, I lost
my job, my sister is considering disolving her two-year engagement to
a nice guy primarily because he may have viewed some porn, my roommate
is kinda out of work too, my motorcycle was confiscated, creditors are
calling me constantly, there's almost no money, I can't get a fucking
phone signal in my house, the sky is totally bleak && overcast, it's
damn cold, you are stressed, Jack && Claire are sick, you don't want
me to come up anymore, you're seeming insecure about my affection or
opinion of you, I'm feeling depressed && suicidal && afraid to tell
anyone because you've all got too much of your own shit to deal with
&& are too far away to just give me the silent hug I'm needing, I
don't know what to do next.

I got my final check for $1800 paying up through my last day of work
yesterday.  I deposited $600 && cashed the rest, bought two In-N-Out
Burger meals just now to sit, eat, smoke, && chat with a homeless
construction worker named Dave who I saw huddled by his shopping cart
as I was driving there.

No, you're not bothering me.

Everything I mentioned was already specific to you, even if it lacked
the detail to reassure you of that, because it was going for breadth
instead of depth.  I don't know how to help you if you seriously doubt
that I miss you.

Here's my termination letter:

November 6, 2007

Pip Stuart
c/o Trilogy Studio
2896 Colorado Ave
Santa Monica, CA 90404

Dear Pip:

I regret to inform you that your employment with Trilogy Studios, Inc.
is terminated
effective immediately.

As you know, we have repeated difficulties in working together, since
you started on
October 1, 2007.  You have repeatedly been given ample opportunity to
improve, and
while we realize you have made efforts to improve, there has been an
undeniable pattern
of irresponsibility and unreliability in addition to many missed
deadlines, inappropriate
behavior, and spotty attendance.

Some of the issues we have noticed and discussed with you include:

  -  Difficulty in adhering to studio hours of operation
  -  Several absences with little or no notification of your
supervisor, including on
     Monday, October 8th (one week after your start date), and Monday,
November 5,
     2007.  Neither were approved
  -  Robin Johnson and you built a collection of goals and milestones,
which you have
     not been met.
  -  Additionally, there has been a disregard for the culture and
norms that exist within
     the company (i.e. not wearing a shirt within the studio and sleeping on the
     premises overnight)

It is expected that you remove your belongings and return your key to
the company prior
to leaving the premises.  You will receive your final paycheck upon
your departure,
which includes all work done up to and including November 6, 2007.
Please also sign
the attached termination agreement and release which states limits on
confidentiality,
trade secrets, and non-disparagement.

Pip, we believe you possess very strong raw abilities as a Tools Programmer, but
unfortunately your lack of maturity, the time and energy needed to
manage you, and your
ability to adhere to company norms and meet deadlines is beyond what Trilogy can
tolerate as a small studio.  We wish you all the best.

Sincerely,

Michael Pole
Chief Executive Officer
... && chief fucking idiotic jackass lying coward

Emmy,

I love you more than anyone or anything else in this entire G-d-forsaken world.

What breaks my heart most right now is that you doubt how I feel about you.

Second is that we must remain apart.

Third is that I can't yet be the stable provider that you or your kids need.

Everything else in the world matters so much less, it's as if not at all.

-Pip

2007-11-07 19:47 Pip: How are you sweets? =)  I was just chillin' out smokin' in my car && and listening to 98.7 thinking about everything && heard the Feist Changes, You Know Who You Are song && felt happy.  Things can be just fine. =)

I can't do this. If you can't be stable in the face of adversity and
even accept responsibility for your actions I can't do this with you.

This is probably the worst timing, but I can't help how I feel right
now about "us." I need a break. This is spinning out way too fast for
me, and then you disregard that I've said so a lot of times now. My
boundaries are very important to me. I can't deal with a suicidal ex
and a suicidal boyfriend. That just tells me again I've put myself
with someone mentally unhealthy. I deserve better, and I need to
protect my kids.

I know this isn't a good time for you to hear me, and you'll probably
blame me for any issues but I need a break. I need to think over
things and figure out what is best for me.

Thank you,

I understand.  Please don't worry about me.  I'll be fine.  I was
prepared for this.  It certainly looks like you've completely missed
that I'm not really suicidal... but that I'm really just feeling like
I need a tight hug from someone who loves me.  Your quote omits that
crucial part && your text belies your growing eagerness to focus on a
suggestion as a hot-button as justification for space you're probably
needing for many other reasons.  That's okay.  A lot is on your mind
&& I complicate things avoidably right now.  You think you need time
to think.  Please do.  I'll continue thinking too.  I know you need a
stable financial provider right now, in addition to an emotional
companion.  I will become both for you, if there's anyway I can, as
soon as possible.  I trust you to do what's best for your kids.
Again, please don't worry about me in the least.  I have not given up
on myself, you, or us in any way.  We may just need some time && some
slightly more conducive circumstances.  Things will be fine no matter
what happens.  I have thoroughly loved our times together && dearly
wish more could be in store.  If you'd rather not have me around, for
any reason, I understand.  Please don't forget how much I love you.
You must know that I do.

Just for clarity, are you officially not considering us together at
all anymore or are we just taking a break but still together?  When
you can, would you please tell me what it is you're really wanting
here?  I'd appreciate it.

Yours truly,
-Pip

You are being a pompous asshole right now. I am fed up. You are
consistently always turning things around and putting me down. I am
done completely, especially after this. You need to grow up. You go
back and reread what you wrote and explain to me over and over how
you are not in the wrong, which is what you do every time I say
something to you about something I don't like about what you've said

Stop bringing my ex in between us, I'm not. You are doing it all on
your own.

Maybe.  Maybe you are instead, or we both are... or we're both just
ourselves, neither excessively pompous or asshole-like... but getting
along is extremely difficult no matter what.

Why?  What was too much?

I know.  I already am growing in many ways consciously.  Can you
clarify some which you think I can && should grow more in?  I don't
think I'm the only person who needs to grow up either.

Maybe that's because I'm trying to understand the heart of every
matter but you remain understandably afraid to do that.

Are you sure?

-- this is when we're caught up entirely to the e-mail you sent me on 2007-11-07 22:59 which contained nothing but excerpts describing clinical abuse, which I addressed carefully in my first big e-mail about you having struck out.  My whole supposedly "suicidal" paragraph was amidst a rant responding to your question: "Everything is messed up for a while?" && concluded once again as follows:

I still think you continue to mis-characterize it.

Fair enough.  You have always been free to make up your mind about any done-ness between us.  You've dumped me harshly several times && my character has remained consistent.

Thanks.  Hopefully you'll indulge me this reply to your contact, since it seems balanced to achieve some sort of parity even in our conclusion, if you make this such.

I've stated many times that that could never be my wish.  I give gifts because I want them to be given freely && entirely away to someone who will appreciate && benefit from them.  If you refuse to appreciate or benefit from them, then yes, it would be kind of you to please gift them back to me as I can still appreciate them.  Even if you won't use them && just wish to smash them, I could never sense that you have any obligation to return anything I've ever freely given to you.  Smash it or burn it all if you wish.  That would be cruel && destructive but I gave it all to you knowing that it would no longer be under my control && I remain entirely fine with that outcome.  I gave && you've remained reluctant to receive.  You've never believed me.  You still are afraid to believe me.  You're testing me && I'm still passing, even if you are too scared now to see it.

Aww poor Emmy.  I've never asked or even wished for any money of yours to go to me except the gasoline money I needed to get to work this past Tuesday because I had exhausted all my accounts && cash on expenditures for you && your kids.  Those are all auditable too.  Let me know if you persist in doubt.

I'm really not going for them.  I've been going for you.

As it happens, I have that e-mail too.  Shall we consider it here && see it posted to my blog too?  I think we shall... after we get through your next segment.  I'd like to note here that weapons, guns, && violence all have valid uses in defense && protection, which is almost exclusively how I refer to them or ever employ them.  They are tools, just as words can be, for good or ill.  Let's see our words speak.

Who is threatening whom?  Let's look at the text of these supposedly violent && threatening e-mails.  If you are completely unhinged, I probably don't really have anything to do with that, as I only put doors back on their hinges as quickly && as well-balanced as I can.  Ask anyone who knows me.

Here is the exchange you're referring to between Ian && I:



> Please do not continue on this path.
This is my path && I walk it proudly.  You cannot condemn me of any wrongdoing with no details or evidence to speak of.  Your assault consists entirely of hearsay accusations or an inappropriate out-of-context interpretation of a single word instead of an entire paragraph, intention, or action.  You are the one on the clouded path.  My honesty is shining in direct sunlight right now.  I'm sorry if it burns you.  If you can withstand it, hopefully we'll be able to stand honestly together.  If not, I will continue my search for a woman who can appreciate me && can let me appreciate her too.

Likewise.
