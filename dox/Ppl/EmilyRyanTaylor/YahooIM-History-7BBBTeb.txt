[02:46] PipTigger: Oops.
[02:46] PipTigger: I tried to check if the call was still connected and accidentally ended it.
[02:46] PipTigger: Were you still there?
[02:47] emmy.rowks: lol
[02:52] PipTigger: Now I lost my signal! =(
[02:52] PipTigger: WTF?!
[02:52] emmy.rowks: lol
[02:52] PipTigger: It'll be cool when I get a fucking land-line here.
[02:52] emmy.rowks: lmao
[05:08] PipTigger: Damn.
[05:17] PipTigger: This wireless coverage is poopoo! =(
[05:45] PipTigger: If you're still awake, please bring your cat back inside from hunting before she's stuck out all night.
[12:24] emmy.rowks: sweets?

[13:49] PipTigger: I'm waking up...
[13:50] PipTigger: I took two pictures last night but they're no good.
[13:51] emmy.rowks: lololol
[13:52] PipTigger: Should I send them anyway.  I mean, you did say to surprise you...
[13:53] PipTigger: ... but I doubt you meant you wanted to be surprised by how uninspiring my photo-taking ability could be. ;)
[13:56] emmy.rowks: lol
[13:59] PipTigger: Wow.  I really feel embarrassed about how lame they are.  The first has a little of the subtlety I wanted but the second is just simple.
[14:00] emmy.rowks: lol
[14:00] PipTigger: I'll send anyway.  I deserve to be humbled more.
[14:01] PipTigger: To Emmy.Rowks@Y! ?
[14:01] emmy.rowks: ya
[14:02] PipTigger: Done.
[14:03] emmy.rowks: (Link: http://emmyrowks.com/blog/)http://emmyrowks.com/blog/
[14:04] PipTigger: Cool.  I've got lots to read now! =)
[14:05] PipTigger: I feel like my throats getting a little sore. =(
[14:07] emmy.rowks: :(
[14:08] emmy.rowks: so... I need to see the subject in person ;)
[14:08] PipTigger: I'm a bit worried about getting you sick now. =(
[14:09] PipTigger: That would be a rude thing to deliver tomorrow.
[14:09] PipTigger: Or did you mean you need to see the subject of my photos in person?
[14:10] emmy.rowks: ;)
[14:10] PipTigger: Ah.
[14:10] emmy.rowks: si
[14:12] PipTigger: Well unless I deteriorate in the next 16 hours, to where I can't drive, then I'll be glad to present myself for your scrutiny in 22 hours (at your house?).
[14:16] emmy.rowks: lol yup
[14:16] emmy.rowks: but...
[14:16] emmy.rowks: while I flirt... I am very reserved LOL
[14:17] PipTigger: Well whatever you want of mine, you can have.
[14:17] PipTigger: I'll gladly give it to you. ;)
[14:17] PipTigger: In a good way.
[14:18] emmy.rowks: lol
[14:20] PipTigger: Any other comments, good or bad, about my pix?  Is my embarrassment warranted?
[14:26] emmy.rowks: not at all
[14:26] emmy.rowks: *cheeky grin*
[14:30] emmy.rowks: u there?
[14:32] PipTigger: yeah
[14:33] PipTigger: Reading physics stuff... and eating left-overs from Jerry's Deli last night with Nat.
[14:34] emmy.rowks: lol
[14:37] emmy.rowks: (Link: http://emmyrowks.com/blog/2007/09/29/quote-2/)http://emmyrowks.com/blog/2007/09/29/quote-2/
[14:39] PipTigger: Whoo!  Good quote!
[14:39] PipTigger: My mom loves good quotes.  She collects them. ;)
[14:39] emmy.rowks: i love quotes
[14:39] emmy.rowks: lol
[14:39] emmy.rowks: quoteland.com is awesome
[14:40] PipTigger: Cool.  I'll tell my mom about it. =)
[14:40] emmy.rowks: "Perfect love is rare indeed - for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise, the flexibility of the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain."  
[14:42] PipTigger: So true... rare.
[14:42] emmy.rowks: "If you have only two pennies left in the world, with the first penny, you should buy rice to feed your family. With the second penny, say the wise Japanese, you should buy a lily. The Japanese understand the importance of dreaming..."
[14:43] PipTigger: ... and beauty
[14:45] emmy.rowks: We can't all be heroes because somebody has to sit on the curb and clap as they go by.  
[14:45] PipTigger: Or fall from a building! ;)
[14:46] emmy.rowks: "First principle: one must need strength, otherwise one will never have it."
[14:47] emmy.rowks: "We work in the dark, We do what we can, We give what we have, Our doubt is our passion, and our passion is our task, The rest is the madness of art." 
[14:48] emmy.rowks: By the time you swear you're his,
Shivering and sighing,
And he vows his passion is
Infinite, undying -
Lady, make a note of this:
One of you is lying. 
[14:49] emmy.rowks: Jealousy is bred in doubts. When those doubts change into certainties, then the passion either ceases or turns absolute madness. 
[14:50] emmy.rowks: Touch passion when it comes your way...It’s rare enough as it is. Don’t walk away when it calls you by name. 
[14:50] PipTigger: Nice!
[14:52] PipTigger: "Jealousy is born of a need to control and an insecurity that a self is so obviously worthless, only control could possibly preserve external goodness."
[14:53] PipTigger: -Pip ;)
[14:54] PipTigger: Jealously and unbridled rage blind people from the fact that they destroy or severely damage what they wrongly thought they loved.
[15:03] emmy.rowks: ohhh i like that one

[15:23] PipTigger: *jumps*
[15:23] PipTigger: ;)
[15:23] PipTigger: I'm writing you an e-mail.  Almost done.
[15:25] PipTigger: *lick* =)
[15:27] emmy.rowks: lol
[15:29] PipTigger: You are beautiful, Emmy.  You are enough for me.  I love how your mind works, and how your body looks, and everything in between.  You photograph yourself beautifully (just as you do everything else).  I am a bit scared that I will turn out to be insufficient for you in some way, but it doesn't help me to worry about what we might discover together.
[15:29] PipTigger: Heh... I should have said "mind works" and "body rowks"! ;)
[15:29] PipTigger: Anagram.
[15:32] PipTigger: I don't think I've ever took a pic of my penis like that before.  Seems like I would have but maybe I used to be more reserved. ;)
[15:32] PipTigger: s/took/taken/;
[15:33] emmy.rowks: lol
[15:33] PipTigger: =)
[15:34] PipTigger: Is your day going well? =)
[15:34] emmy.rowks: yup :)
[15:34] PipTigger: Yay!
[15:35] emmy.rowks: we leave in a bit to meet my neighbor and his kids to go see a movie
[15:35] emmy.rowks: their treat :)
[15:35] PipTigger: So are you just going to monitor Morganne's peeing comforts in case she needs more UTI attention?
[15:35] emmy.rowks: yup
[15:36] PipTigger: Cool.  I've gotta get ready to meet my friends for the bachelor party soon too.
[15:36] PipTigger: I don't feel like drinking tonight though.  I just want to drive to you already.
[15:37] emmy.rowks: you can post on my blog
[15:37] PipTigger: Maybe I'll wash all the I-5 bugs off my car before I get to your house though, so you don't feel quite so much like I'm trying to pick you up in some beater jalopy. ;)
[15:37] PipTigger: All right.
[15:37] emmy.rowks: lmao
[15:39] PipTigger: Shall I modify it a bit so the general public audience can feel included a bit in my awareness as the message is delivered to you?
[15:39] emmy.rowks: ok
[15:39] emmy.rowks: whatever you want
[15:39] PipTigger: Do you have a preference?
[15:40] emmy.rowks: nope lol
[15:40] PipTigger: I'd be fine posting it as-is too... maybe with a tiny addendum saying "Emmy: you can post on my blog" ;)
[15:43] PipTigger: Cool.  I'll weigh it and see which seems to suit the sentiment better.  I also feel a bit protective of speaking so candidly and intimately with you, that publicizing it unedited might expose you (and much less so for me) to unwelcome new vulnerability amongst others... evil ones, and the like that were described in what I couldn't finish reading.
[15:46] PipTigger: Have fun at the movie.  I'm eager to see you in less than a day.  I'll be in touch after the party, before I get on the road. =)
[15:47] emmy.rowks: ok
[16:02] emmy.rowks: bbl
[16:02] PipTigger: I created a login and submitted my e-mail as a comment but it didn't show up.  Maybe you have to approve it.
[16:02] emmy.rowks: *smoochies*
[16:02] PipTigger: Later. =)

[10:55] emmy.rowks: In reference to:  No Subject  posted by   Emmy Taylor
  
So I don't know what to say here. Because these new requirements limit my ability to do the best I can with my current life situation. I feel that this requirement discriminates against my type of situation.

Please let me know. I understand that you are pushing us to put ourselves out there and gain more experience with a broader spectrum of clients/models/people, but I just don't see how I'll be able to abide by these requirements ALL the time.

Thanks,
Emmy
 


Emmy, while I empathize with your situation, I'm sure there are many other students who have very difficult situations that they are doing there best to overcome. I have consulted with the administration about your case and the feeling is -- and I agree with it -- that I cannot make an exception for you. They were also in support of my efforts to push the students in this class to deal with a broader spectrum of subje

[10:57] PipTigger: That's just more retardation though.

Just off the top of my head, exchanging baby-sitting duties for free photos to someone who needs them might be a possibility. I have given you plenty of notice to deal with this.??Marianne
[10:58] PipTigger: OMG!
[10:58] PipTigger: She's dumb as rocks!
[10:58] PipTigger: That's way lame.
[10:58] emmy.rowks: Marianne,

I live in a world where I must keep my doors locked 24/7. I live in a world where I can't even let my kids out to play in the backyard without me there. I will just have to take a hit on my grades if there are assignments in which I cannot get done to these requirements due to safety concerns for my children or myself.

I appreciate you looking into it for me.

Emmy 
[10:58] PipTigger: I hope you were able to finish or make some good progress on your physics before you fell asleep at least.
[10:59] emmy.rowks: I fell asleep on the couch
[10:59] emmy.rowks: with the physics book
[10:59] emmy.rowks: lol
[10:59] PipTigger: heh
[10:59] PipTigger: Well I'm heading off to work shortly.  I hope you have a good day.  Things will work out with your classes.
[11:00] PipTigger: It may just take a bit longer.
[11:00] emmy.rowks: have a good day
[11:00] PipTigger: Thank you, sweets.

[18:31] PipTigger: LOL
[18:31] PipTigger: I can't really answer whether I think you're "high-maintenance" because that's not something I have ever been able to judge well.
[18:32] emmy.rowks: lol
[18:32] PipTigger: I think the answer is probably "yes" but I totally would rather care about people who are involving.
[18:32] PipTigger: I'm high-maintenance I'm sure too.
[18:33] PipTigger: Don't you think?
[18:33] PipTigger: =)
[18:34] PipTigger: I'm looking forward to seeing you late tomorrow night (like hopefully a little after midnight, if that's still cool with you). =)
[18:34] emmy.rowks: lolol
[18:34] emmy.rowks: Actually
[18:34] emmy.rowks: I was going to say Sat night
[18:35] emmy.rowks: bcause I want to sleep in
[18:35] PipTigger: Ok.
[18:35] emmy.rowks: and do some sat morn cartoons with the kids
[18:35] PipTigger: You could sleep in too... but I don't want to crowd you either.
[18:35] emmy.rowks: so... late sat afternoon?
[18:35] emmy.rowks: I can't sleep in with people in the house
[18:36] PipTigger: Even if I was sleeping too?  Maybe by you?
[18:36] emmy.rowks: I couldn't sleep at all really
[18:36] emmy.rowks: and that would be way too fast for me
[18:36] emmy.rowks: and my kids
[18:37] PipTigger: hmm... Well if we're postponing it a day, one of my co-workers is having a BBQ Sat afternoon that I should attend so maybe I'll drive after that then.  How's that sound?
[18:37] emmy.rowks: Math Blaster: Master the Basics by Knowledge Adventure I'm thinking of buying this for the kids to do... can you google it and tell me what you think... if it would be worth getting for Morganne especially?
[18:37] emmy.rowks: Ok sounds good
[18:37] PipTigger: Yeah.  I've heard good things about Math Blaster.
[18:38] PipTigger: I can't say whether Morganne would find it at all interesting enough to keep her attention though.
[18:39] PipTigger: So I'll call you after the BBQ on Sat. afternoon when I'm leaving.
[18:39] emmy.rowks: okies
[18:39] PipTigger: Tonight I'm going to hang out with some of my computer nerd friends so maybe I could call you around 10pm-ish?
[18:42] emmy.rowks: ok
[18:42] emmy.rowks: :)
[18:42] PipTigger: Cool.  TTYL sweets. =)

[18:47] PipTigger: I've gotta run but if he can wait a day for SafeWay delivery or there's another way I can help you get them sooner, let me know && I'll do what I can.  Maybe they could be added to the unfinished SafeWay order with enough other stuff to get the CARE breast-cancer-research donation to go through too.  Later.
[18:48] PipTigger: P.S. Don't forget to eat good food yourself either! ;)

[09:13] emmy.rowks: :)
[09:14] PipTigger: Did you sleep well?
[09:15] emmy.rowks: sort of
[09:15] emmy.rowks: LOL
[09:15] PipTigger: How's that
[09:15] PipTigger: ?
[09:16] emmy.rowks: kids getting in bed all night
[09:16] PipTigger: Ah.  Of course.
[09:16] PipTigger: Well hopefully you have a good day ahead. =)

[09:18] PipTigger: Whatever is best.
[09:19] PipTigger: Maybe I can pretend I'm less thrilled with you than I am. ;)
[09:21] PipTigger: heh I'll act like there's other places I'd rather be than close to you... starting now! ;)  I'm heading to work.  TTYL sweets.

[23:58] PipTigger: I'm expecting your iPhone battery died.
[23:59] PipTigger: I heard you say "I understand if a dog [wakes you up because it] needs to go to the bathroom."
[00:00] PipTigger: Dogs can be trained to hold it... or even ring a bell when they want to go out.
[00:02] PipTigger: They have many relatively basic motivations that can be recognized, understood, && empathized with by kind masters.
[00:04] PipTigger: Forceful domination, while the most popular, is unnecessary && harmful in my experience (as well as that of a small minority of accomplished trainers && authors of canine instruction books).
[00:08] PipTigger: I think the worst thing you can do to a dog is to treat it totally inconsistently, by sometimes forcing && commanding it to do anything && other times behaving entirely subserviently to it, without rhyme or reason as to what or when or how.
[00:11] PipTigger: That seems to undermine their entire notion of self, confusing them into being completely erratic, ill, and cruel themselves.  They can't know any proper role, which destroys any stable comfortable identity concept they can have.
[00:17] PipTigger: I think the second worst is ruling only with physical force.  At least they will know their place and they will obey... but they'll cower in fear of retribution and will often try to escape captivity in search of a pack that can appreciate them with more respect for their loyal service && where they can find some level of consistent affection beyond simply having their survival needs met.
[00:27] PipTigger: They can be trained without having physical harm visited upon them.  Even pups of typically mean breeds can blossom into happy, playful, && gentle dogs.  Careful control employed in the provision of their food, shelter, && exercise/play, in a consistent fashion, can be used to teach reliability in their performance of increasingly complex behaviors throughout their lifetime (at least until they age into senility or suffer some other mental instability and deterioration).
[00:28] PipTigger: I don't believe the old adage: "You can't teach an old dog new tricks."  Usually, you can!
[00:44] PipTigger: I don't mean to have a strong opinion about dominance in any relationships in a way that's insensitive to your uncertainty in attempting to discern or judge distinctions about health, acceptability, or success.  Please don't take my opinion (even if it seems adamant and contruous) as criticism of you.  It's just my perspective.  I envision a world where loving honesty && generosity become recognized as more stable && successful than brutality, coercion, and selfishness.  I believe it's possible.  I hope it can && does happen soon... for the sake of every person && every other living thing here.
[00:46] PipTigger: s/contruous/congruous/;
[00:53] PipTigger: Well, I hope you have a good night.  I'll let you know what I can take care of as your assistant... but please be patient as I'm beginning to feel too tired to get much more done tonight, having only had a small nap of several hours around midday.  Sweet dreams. =)
[01:22] emmy.rowks: boo
[02:00] PipTigger: Hey.
[02:01] PipTigger: I just nodded off but woke up to my phone beep.
[02:02] emmy.rowks: lol
[02:02] emmy.rowks: oh go back to sleep
[02:02] emmy.rowks: lol
[02:03] PipTigger: I will... but did you want to chat at all more first?
[02:04] emmy.rowks: nah i am gonna go crash
[02:04] emmy.rowks: am exhausted
[02:04] PipTigger: k
[02:04] emmy.rowks: lol
[02:05] PipTigger: Well I hope you get good rest too then... && look forward to talking more hopefully tomorrow. =)

[09:41] PipTigger: My boss has asked me to make a better effort to be at work by 10am so I'm gonna try to make that happen.

[18:41] emmy.rowks: lol
[18:41] PipTigger: heh
[18:42] PipTigger: You read the article?

[18:51] PipTigger: Only ever too old if you think you are.
[18:51] PipTigger: Can you think of anything you'd like me to bring?  I think I'm gonna leave my laptop unless there's a particular reason to bring it.
[18:58] emmy.rowks: ok
[18:59] emmy.rowks: i was thinking you could take the voice thing off the MP3 player?
[19:04] PipTigger: Oh yeah.  Can we not do that with your computer?  I can pack up my laptop if it will be easier for me to do it.
[19:05] emmy.rowks: whatever you want
[19:05] PipTigger: If you computer will work, it'll be easier for me to just keep a copy on flash memory to take a backup back home with me.
[19:05] emmy.rowks: ok
[19:06] PipTigger: k
[19:06] PipTigger: I'll leave in the next 30 mins or so. =)

[10:20] emmy.rowks: I sent you another email.
[10:20] PipTigger: I see... but I don't think you're permitting responses via e-mail anymore.
[10:21] PipTigger: AUTOMATED RESPONSE: 
  
 This mailbox is not accepting email from this sender, and your email 
 has been deleted. Please do not attempt to resend as you will recieve 
 the same response. 
 
[10:21] PipTigger: That came back from The.Diva@EmmyRowks.Com (similar to when Natalie decided she wanted no more of it.).
[10:22] PipTigger: Do you not even want a response?
[10:22] PipTigger: Am I not permitted to dive into any details because I do it too thoroughly?
[10:24] PipTigger: Let me just say this, in case you're reading at all:  I *am* truly deeply very very bitterly sorry that you're so hurt.
[10:25] PipTigger: I just got your text-message but then my signal disappeared as I was attempting to reply to say: The automated response I received suggests that e-mails from me are now bouncing back when sent to your phone address.
[10:26] PipTigger: I think it should be well understood at this point that my mobile phone reception is extremely unreliable && a source of confusion && frustration between us.  Can we please stop using my phone for our communications?
[10:27] PipTigger: I'll call you now.
[10:27] PipTigger: Well I just got out of the shower... so I need to throw some clothes on && step outside to get a signal first.
[10:27] PipTigger: I will call you very shortly.
[10:29] PipTigger: I also wanted to ask you to please call Gary && explain that I'm very sorry that I lost my job this past week && am now unfortunately unable to afford to purchase the second puppy as had been originally agreed upon && planned.  I really didn't intend to lose my job or become unable to follow through with what we had twice agreed upon.
[10:31] emmy.rowks: You said: Am I not permitted to dive into any details because I do it too thoroughly?
[10:36] emmy.rowks: I say: You have deeply hurt me. You went to a forum in which you know you excel at, knowing that I don't have the time (as I have to take care of 5 kids 24/7) or the inclination to publicly fight with you. That is what you were doing, fighting verbally. That to me is so wrong to do to someone you say you love. Why would you hurt me knowing what a private person I am? You never admit your being wrong, you go and point out how everyone around YOU is wrong, but not you. You gave no true apology to me at all. You keep thinking its okay to continue hurting me after I said I was feeling violated. When did my feelings come into your equation at all? You were like you've given me no reasonable examples why it is a violation. But there is never logic to emotions, you know that. Yet, you continued even after I said it was a violation to me. That is not respecting me at all.
[16:39] PipTigger: I'm back home.  I'd contend with several things you've written above but you mention the imbalance of our respectively available time && proficiency with a particular communicative forum so let me ask one simple question && address the most significant point of disagreement I think we have with what you've written above.
[16:40] PipTigger: What is your *best* form of communication, the one that would be *most* fair to you for me to employ for us to work things out?
[16:42] PipTigger: I have told you repeatedly that *I* believe there is *always* logic to emotions, although most people don't believe this, cannot perceive it, && have difficulty imagining it too... even if it can be reasoned... logically && consistently.  Therefore, as I have tried to explain to you many times, I most certainly do *not* know that there's "never logic to emotions."  I am convinced of quite the opposite.
[16:53] PipTigger: This is perhaps the crux of all of our greatest difficulties because if you're certain there's never logic && I'm certain there always is, that leaves no common ground at all... && worse, it encourages you to feel that logic should never dissuade your feelings && me to never be dissuaded by your illogical claims (by which I mean that I may be able to see && describe all sorts of logical explanations for your emotions but at some point, I will have to reach an impasse where you deny logic illogically, which is where any of our common experience or understanding probably has to stall, dissolve, && fade away).
[16:57] PipTigger: I'll be back later.  I'm heading to my uncle's house for coffee. =)
