This e-mail dealt with Morganne's bladder infection and Michael's
voice-mails stating that he wouldn't be taking the kids that weekend
(which was Saturday, September 29th and Sunday, September 30th) or
any weekend in the foreseeable future, that he was quitting his job
to no longer have to pay, that he'd come over to the house, that
he'd kill himself, etc..

I would like to have the kids come stay with me this weekend. I will
plan to pick them up at 5 or 6 on Friday at your house.

I am unavailable the weekend of the 20th and 21. So I would also like
to have them with me the weekend of Oct 27 and 28. I will plan to pick
them up at the usual time at your house on Oct. 26 unless I hear otherwise.

I guess I will wait to schedule any further weekday visitation until I
know the status of the final divorce papers, and we will do everything
more or less by the book until then.

Thanks,
Mike

I got myself into some financial trouble giving you (and spending on you
& the kids) so much money in late August and September ($8184.90 from
August 10 to September 18 according to the careful records I have been
keeping).  And this month I have paid the required $3000 for child
support and $1000 for alimony. I can't afford to help you with this.

Maybe in the future if you want me to help with extras like this you can
include me in the decision to enroll the kids in these types of
activities, which will also allow me more notice.

Michael,

As to this, show me the proof. You stopped payment on car payments,
you gave me less money when you said you'd take care of something FOR
me. So please, your accounting is terrible so do not try this crap
with me again in the future. You are a manipulative individual and I
feel rather sorry for you.

I promise I am not trying to manipulate you.  I am not sure what I would
gain if I were.

If you really want to see, the spreadsheet I have been using to track
money going your way is attached to this message.  I have receipts for
everything except the $60 cash I handed you in person, but I am sure you
remember that.  Trust me, the numbers here surprised me also.

And not everything I spent is included here.  What's not included here,
for example, is any of the money I spent bringing lunch or dinner over,
or any expenses associated with the weekend I spent helping you move
everything to your new house (except for the second $1000 deposit I made
when I signed the lease, which is included here).

Also, if you check with your finance company you will find that both of
the checks from my account for your car payments cleared.  If they tell
you anything different, then you should challenge them.  In case you
need them, the details of the transactions from my account, including
confirmation numbers are included below.

I still hope that eventually we can come to some kind of mutually
respectful co-parenting relationship.

  Subject: Message to Michael about the van
This is a copy of the message I sent to Michael a few moments ago.

Dear Michael,

Because you have not made the car payments as agreed, the van will
be repossessed because the amount owed is over $2,700.  You have
not held up your agreement to make payments of $400 every two weeks.
If this happens, she will not be able to take the kids to doctor
visits, dentist visits, or drive the kids to our house for
visitations, or, to or from school.  Visitations will have to be
put on hold until this issue is resolved. 

You owe $2,800 in back support for August and another $6,000 from
May through July.  You are financially abusing Emily, but more
important, the biggest impact is on your own kids.  You have got to
get past your anger and quit lashing out at your kids.  It is not
fair to them.

Can you take care of your obligations?

It was to be direct deposited today ($2000). It didn't show up. He is
now playing mad games with support. I have $75 in the bank this is
ridiculous.

My rent for Oct was past due, and November is now due. I'll be
calling this REACH program today to see if they will help, but again
i think I will lose another house over our heads.

  Subject: Checks
Melissa and Sarah,

My mom received checks form my ex on Monday. Today i went to cash
them at his bank. They wouldn't cash them, and told me I needed to
deposit them at my bank, but they checked first to see if they would
clear. I received a check for $1500 (child support) and $500
(alimony). The teller told me to deposit the $1500 and not the $500
because both wouldn't clear his account only one would.

So I went to my bank and deposited the check for child support. My
bank put a 11-day business hold on the check, because I was overdrawn
(due to the direct deposit being cancelled by him without warning)
and because the check is out of state. So the funds won't be
available until the 27th of November. Which is really bad considering
my rent is past due, and I have no money for groceries now.

I am not sure what to do now that he is playing these financial
games....

Dear Michael,

The checks you sent have an address scratched out, are out of state,
and one of them was no good.  Not even your bank that the checks were
written on would cash them.  The funds will NOT be available until
November 27, 2007.  So, you are depriving your children of food and
endangering the roof over their heads once again.

Starting immediately, any checks must be cashier's checks only.  Your
personal checks are not acceptable in California.

If I knew your mother's email address, I would send this to her.  I
am sure she doesn't know about you not supporting your children.

Michael, you must meet your obligations before the authorities become
involved.
