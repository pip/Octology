[10:36] emmy.rowks: I say: You have deeply hurt me. You went to a forum in which you know you excel at, knowing that I don't have the time (as I have to take care of 5 kids 24/7) or the inclination to publicly fight with you. That is what you were doing, fighting verbally. That to me is so wrong to do to someone you say you love. Why would you hurt me knowing what a private person I am? You never admit your being wrong, you go and point out how everyone around YOU is wrong, but not you. You gave no true apology to me at all. You keep thinking its okay to continue hurting me after I said I was feeling violated. When did my feelings come into your equation at all? You were like you've given me no reasonable examples why it is a violation. But there is never logic to emotions, you know that. Yet, you continued even after I said it was a violation to me. That is not respecting me at all.
