=head1 NAME

Time::DayOfWeek - calculate which Day-of-Week a date or today is

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 1.8 of Time::DayOfWeek, which was released on Fri Jul 22 10:16:29:07 -0500 2016.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use strict;use warnings;use utf8;use v5.10;
  use Time::DayOfWeek qw(:dow);

  my         ($year, $month, $day)  =  (2003, 12, 7);

  say "The Day-of-Week of $year/$month/$day (YMD) is: ",
    DayOfWeek($year, $month, $day);

  say 'The 3-letter abbreviation       of the Dow is: ',
    Dow(      $year, $month, $day);

  say 'The 0-based  index              of the DoW is: ',
    DoW(      $year, $month, $day);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module just calculates the Day-of-Week for any particular date. It was inspired by the clean L<Time::DaysInMonth> module written by David Muir
Sharnoff <Muir@Idiom.Com>.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 DoW(<Year>, <Month>, <Day>)

Time::DayOfWeek's core function which does the calculation and returns the weekday index answer between 0 and 6. If no Year is supplied, now's date is assumed.
If no Month or Day is supplied, they are set to 1. Months are 1-based with values between 1 and 12. Days similarly range from 1 through 31.

DoW() is the only function that is exported from a normal 'use Time::DayOfWeek;' command. Other functions can be imported into the local namespace explicitly
or with the following tags:

  :all - every function described here
  :dow - only DoW(), Dow(), and DayOfWeek()
  :nam - only DayNames()  and  MonthNames()
  :day - everything       but  MonthNames()

=head2 Dow(<Year>, <Month>, <Day>)

Dow()       is the same as DoW() above but returns 3-letter day abbreviations running from 'Sun' through 'Sat'.

=head2 DayOfWeek(<Year>, <Month>, <Day>)

DayOfWeek() is the same as DoW() above but returns full day names from 'Sunday' through 'Saturday'.

=head2 DayNames(<@NewDayNames>)

DayNames() can override default day names with the strings in @NewDayNames. The current list of day names is returned so call DayNames() with no parameters to
obtain a list of the default day names.

An example call for Spanish days would be:

  DayNames(qw(Domingo Lunes Martes Miercoles Jueves Viernes Sabado));

=head2 MonthNames(<@NewMonthNames>)

MonthNames() has also been included to provide a centralized name set. Just like DayNames(), this function returns the current list of month names so call it
with no parameters to obtain a list of the default month names.
