# Octology
The ontology of 8. `$VERSION='0.0';$d8VS='K2GLEAMY';`

What is an ontology, you may ask?

<ol><li>n. (Computer Science) a rigorous and exhaustive organiz8ion of some knowledge domain that is usually hierarchical and contains all the relevant
  entities and their rel8ions.</li>
    <li>n. (Philosophy) the metaphysical study of the nature of being and existence.</li>
    <li>n. (Logic) the set of entities presupposed by a theory.</li>
</ol>

I expect after some point (probably passed) anyone who studies Octology thoroughly would become able to develop any new videogame and problem-solve.

"Perl 5 was a machine-shop for making other tools." -LarryWall on d8=J6K TPCiP interview. I'd like Octology to be regarded similarly for game tools.

This was basically a public preview of my early development files. I am nearly ready for serious collaboration, but welcome any sorts of feedback.

I mainly wanted to start this repository as my locus for future efforts and to start showing top screen shots that convey noteworthy capabilities.

Many `bin/` commands print useful Help text when given a `-h` parameter (white stars on blue after class name in `sumb` results, mainly a8 && d8).

If your paths and Perl environment are setup similarly, to gain a bearing on fundamental Octology utilities and organiz8ion, please try executing:

 * `ftst` - run the gamut of Perl File TeSTs on the default .Hrc file
 * `tsgr` - Test Select Graphic Rendition additional text attributes
<!--
 * `tstn ` - TeST Navig8ion of A-Star algorithm in Screeps 50x50 maps
 * `tstc ` - TeST c8 Col8 color8ion classic representation progression-->
<!-- * `tsgr` - Test Select Graphic Rendition additional text attributes
 * `wh auu acs ai g grp psag pe` - show a basic colored list of very useful GNU/Linux aliases-->

 * `sumb` - SUMmarize most ~/bin/ executaBle files rather colorfully
 * `pal8` - set first 16-color PALette ("8") for terminal or console
<!-- * `gnp8 ` - GeNerate a complete Pal8 mapping of b64 into 256-colors
 * `calN ` - display a CALeNdar of the colored d8-based recent Years-->
<!-- * `lodH ` - LOaD ~/.Hrc d8a-file to parse and print colorized fields-->

### Public Purpose
If I ever become unable to continue developing this project further, my hope is that at least this repository provides others the ability to
  utilize any of my beneficial work and ideas (hopefully to further FreeLibreSoftware with derivatives also seeing release under the GPLv3+).
