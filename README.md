#    Octology
 The ontology of 8. Ocho dude. Hachi-desu. Wheet. Aucht! `$VERSION='0.0';$d8VS='L94MBuT2';`

`dic ontology`:  # query the dictd (Dictionary-Daemon) for salient definitions that project visitors might find inform8ive;

<ol><li>n. `(Computer Science)` a rigorous and exhaustive organiz8ion of some knowledge domain that is usually hierarchical
      and contains all the relevant entities and their rel8ions.</li>
    <li>n. `(Philosophy      )` the metaphysical study of the n8ure of being and existence.</li>
    <li>n. `(Logic           )` the set of entities presupposed by a theory.</li>
</ol>

I expect after some point (probably passed) anyone who studies Octology thoroughly would be able to develop new video-games and problem-solve well.

"Perl 5 was a machine-shop for making other tools." -LarryWall `d8=J6K` TPCiP interview. I'd like Octology to be regarded similarly for game-tools.

Please watch my [6-minute Lightning-Talk](https://YouTu.be/Oul8KrS7TQk) which I presented for the-Perl-Conference-in-the-Cloud on June 24th, 2020 (`d8=K6O`)
 then my [21-minute Black-Jack Tech-Talk](https://YouTu.be/FgS6IXq-xVE) more recently at:the-Perl/Raku-Conference-in-the-Cloud on June  9th, 2021 (`d8=L69`);

<!-- # Hopefully I won't remain off-line for too long && won't need to try to explain my potential absence with these drafted details below here. We'll see;
On August 24th, 2021 (`d8=L8O`) my old NetGear Cable-Modem/Router stopped working. This stranded me basically Off8Line at home (with only GalaxyS8 phone on).
I've attempted to obtain and setup a replacement without success so far, and now it's September and I'm not sure how or when I'll become able to re-connect.

This may be my last upd8 for probably quite a while ahead, since only Wolf values what I do. I can barely afford to maintain computers at home anymore.
Ken, Chun, and Akuma won't boot. Ryu and Oni languish. I hoped Octology would make waves, but it hasn't. I've done what I could, but may be done!  =( ; -->

This repository was started in 2017 (`d8=HAD`) to be the locus for future collabor8ive efforts, and as a site to show top noteworthy screen-shots.

If your paths and Perl environment are setup similarly, to gain a bearing on fundamental Octology utilities and organiz8ion, please try executing:

 * `ftst` - run the gamut of Perl File TeSTs on the default .Hrc file
 * `tsgr` - Test Select Graphic Rendition additional text attributes
<!--
 * `tstn ` - TeST Navig8ion of A-Star algorithm in Screeps 50x50 maps
 * `tstc ` - TeST c8 Col8 color8ion classic representation progression-->
<!-- * `tsgr` - Test Select Graphic Rendition additional text attributes
 * `wh auu acs ai g grp psag pe` - show a basic colored list of very useful GNU/Linux aliases-->

 * `sumb` - SUMmarize most ~/bin/ executaBle files rather colorfully
 * `pal8` - set first 16-color PALette ("8") for terminal or console
<!-- * `gnp8 ` - GeNerate a complete Pal8 mapping of b64 into 256-colors
 * `calN ` - display a CALeNdar of the colored d8-based recent Years-->
<!-- * `lodH ` - LOaD ~/.Hrc d8a-file to parse and print colorized fields-->

Probably the best way to evalU8 Octology is to build and run a Docker container specified by the following commands, which facilit8 testing:

  `docker build . -t oct`  # to be run in the root directory of a git cloned local repository from this project's main oper8ional hyperlink;

  `docker run -e DISPLAY --mount type=bind,source=/home/pip/.log,target=/home/tst/.log -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -it oct`  #muchworks

To build something close to a similar setup to mine, you'll probably want to execute the following sequences of commands to get going first:

  `git clone https://GitHub.Com/Pip/Octology`  # which should crE8 the Octology/ sub-directory in your Current-Working-Directory (or:`pwd`),

  `cd Octology; cp -a lib bin dox dvl gfx gmz muz mvz .Hrc .Xrc .bashrc .lrc .lsrc .shl.style .vimrc .zshrc ~; chsh $(which zsh); cd ~; zsh`

  and you'll want to: `cpanm ...` or `pmei Time::DaysInMonth` since I (through Octology) depend on that module, but am not maintainer of it;

  Also the `Color::Similarity::RGB` module is employed in `pm2x` to gener8 an expanded pal8 map from the rel8ive proximity of nearby colors;

### Octology is *NOT* Ready for Production!

I must emphasize this software system is *NOT* ready yet for prime-time. Do *NOT* use it in a production environment, without careful testing beforehand!

Octology has not been stress-tested for any security purposes. Please use at your own risk and know there are many bugs, document8ion remains troublingly
  incomplete in many areas, it is sorely missing some needed fE8ures, and it contains probably several possible security issues.

Most of the included code works primarily as designed and performs what it was originally intended to, but it badly needs to undergo more serious testing!

To reiter8: Do *NOT* use Octology in any Mission-Critical situ8ions! It has many experimental and untested parts. It has essentially been merely an overly
  ambitious hobby-project, implemented by just a single coder (with effectively no budget, and has had no real concrete goals or milestone schedules yet).

### Forgive Some Self-Promotion
If you are willing to fund this development effort, please visit my [SubscribeStar](https://SubscribeStar.Com/Pip "Pip's Octology SubscribeStar Page")
  or                                                                      [Patreon](https://patreon.com/PipStuart "Pip's Octology Patreon       Page")
  and feel free to send me the *Top8* new fixes and fE8ures you would want most.

Please also contact me if you are an open-minded thinker interested in any convers8ion or friendship (especially near OshKOsh, WisConSin).

To learn about the long-term goals, plans, thinking, and research behind this expansive project, please consult l8St development notes at:

Thank you for your consider8ion as well as any constructive criticism, recommend8ions, or whatever other feedback you may be able to offer.

### Public Purpose
If I ever become unable to continue developing this project further, my hope is that at least this repository provides others the ability to
  utilize any of my beneficial work and ideas (hopefully to further FreeLibreSoftware with deriv8ives also seeing release under the GPLv3+).
