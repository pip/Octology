# Octology
An ontology based on organizing everything by the number 8.

`$VERSION='0.0';$d8VS='HB4M9WYn';`

This is basically a preview of version 0.0 of my development files.

I am not yet too interested in serious collaboration at this point.

I just wanted to start a repository as a framework for future efforts.

Many bin/ commands print some help text when given a -h parameter.

If your Perl environment and paths are similar, try running:
`    sumb, ftst,  tsgr, tstc,    gnp8, pal8,  calN, lodH`

Hopefully if I become unable to continue on this project for any reason, at least
  this repository should provide others the ability to utilize some of my work. =)

  feel free to include the top 8 features you'd most like to see.

Please also e-mail me if you're an open-minded person in the Oshkosh
  area who is interested in friendship. I'm lonely much of the time.
