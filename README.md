# Octology
An ontology based on organizing everything by the number 8.

This is basically a preview of version 0.0 of my development files.

I am not yet too interested in serious collaboration at this point.

I just wanted to start a repository as a framework for future efforts.

The .tgz files in the lib/ directory will need to be uncompressed.

Several bin/ commands print some help text when given a -h parameter.

If you're able to setup a Perl environment like mine, try running:
  sumb, pal8, ftst, tstc, gnp8, tsgr, calN, and lodH to learn a bit.

Hopefully if I am unable to continue this project, at least this
  repo will provide others the ability to utilize some of my work. =)

### Forgive Me For a Bit of Self-Promotion
Please e-mail me if you'd like to donate to my development effort and
  feel free to include the top 8 features you'd most like to see.
  
Please also e-mail me if you're a like-minded person in the Oshkosh
  area who is interested in friendship. I'm lonely much of the time.
