# Octology
An ontology based on the power of 8. ` $VERSION='0.0';$d8VS='HBALANCE'; `

This is basically the first public preview of my early development files.

I'm not yet interested in serious collaboration, but welcome feedback.

I mainly wanted to start this repository as a site for future efforts.

I'd also like to show off screen shots conveying novel capabilities.

Many bin/ commands print some Help text when given a `-h` parameter.

If your Perl environment and paths are similar to mine, try running:
  `sumb, ftst,  tsgr, tstc,    gnp8, pal8,  calN, lodH`

If I become unable to continue this project for any reason, at least this repo
  should hopefully provide others the ability to utilize some of my work. `=)`

### Forgive Me For a Bit of Self-Promotion
Please e-mail me if you'd like to donate to my development effort, and
  feel free to include the top 8 features you'd most like to see next.

Please also e-mail me if you're an open-minded person in the Oshkosh
  area who is interested in friendship. I'm lonely much of the time.

*Note*: Some shots which originally listed in the "Top 8" may not have been
migrated down to this old list, probably mainly because they were clearly
supplanted by some superior shot or when including them here seems like it
might be too confusing or wasteful to be worth preserving in this fashion.
