# Octology
An ontology based on organizing code and data at least initially into groups of 8.
This is basically a preview of version 0.0 of my development files.
I'm not really interested in serious collaboration at this point.
Just wanted to start a repository as a framework for future efforts.
The .tgz files in the lib/ directory will need to be uncompressed.
Hopefully if I am unable to continue this project, at least this
  repo will provide others the ability to utilize some of my work. =)
