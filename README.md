# Octology
An ontology based on the power of 8. `$VERSION='0.0';$d8VS='HC3LGame';`

This is basically the first public preview of my early development files. I am not yet ready for serious code collaboration, but welcome feedback.

I mainly wanted to start this repository as my locus for future efforts and to start showing top screen shots that convey noteworthy capabilities.

Many `bin/` commands print useful Help text when given a `-h` parameter. If your paths and Perl environment are setup similarly, please try to run:
 * `sumb` - SUMmarize most ~/bin/ executaBle files quite colorfully
 * `tstn` - TeST Navig8ion of A-Star algorithm in Screeps 50x50 maps
 * `tstc` - TeST c8 Col8 color8ion classic representation progression
 * `tsgr` - Test Select Graphic Rendition additional text attributes
 * `gnp8` - GeNerate a complete mapping of b64 into 256-color Pal8
 * `pal8` - set first 16-color PALette ("8") for terminal or console
 * `calN` - display the current Year as a colored d8-based CALeNdar
 * `lodH` - LOaD ~/.Hrc d8a-file to parse then print colored fields

#### Public Purpose
If I ever become unable to continue developing this project further, my hope is that at least this repository can provide others the ability to
  utilize any of my beneficial work and ideas (hopefully to further FreeLibreSoftware with derivatives also seeing release under the GPLv3+). `=)`

*Note*: Some shots which were originally listed in the **Top8** may not have migrated down to this older list, probably because they were replaced by a
clearly superior shot or they seemed too confusing or wasteful to keep a current repository version for. Please bear in mind that these older shots are far
more likely than those in the current Top8 list to portray behaviors and details which have been modified somewhat since then.
