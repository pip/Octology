# Octology
The ontology of 8. `$VERSION='0.0';$d8VS='I88M6Top';`

This is basically a public preview of my early development files. I am not yet ready for serious collaboration, but welcome any sort of feedback.

I mainly wanted to start this repository as my locus for future efforts and to start showing top screen shots that convey noteworthy capabilities.

Many `bin/` commands print useful Help text when given a `-h` parameter. If your paths and Perl environment are setup similarly, please try to run:

 * `sumb` - SUMmarize most ~/bin/ executaBle files rather colorfully
 * `tstn` - TeST Navig8ion of A-Star algorithm in Screeps 50x50 maps
 * `tstc` - TeST c8 Col8 color8ion classic representation progression
<!-- * `tsgr` - Test Select Graphic Rendition additional text attributes-->

 * `gnp8` - GeNerate a complete Pal8 mapping of b64 into 256-colors
 * `pal8` - set first 16-color PALette ("8") for terminal or console
 * `calN` - display a CALeNdar of the colored d8-based recent Years
<!-- * `lodH` - LOaD ~/.Hrc d8a-file to parse then print colored fields-->

### Public Purpose
If I ever become unable to continue developing this project further, my hope is that at least this repository provides others the ability to
  utilize any of my beneficial work and ideas (hopefully to further FreeLibreSoftware with derivatives also seeing release under the GPLv3+).

*Note*: Please bear in mind that these older shots at the bottom here are far more likely than those in the current **Top8** list above to portray behaviors
and exhibit details which have been modified somewhat (or possibly replaced entirely) within the time that lapsed since the d8 a particular shot was taken on.

*8plc*: If you would like to download a pre-gener8d colored output file for running a recent: `8plc a` to finalize with l8st -gM8ria block map for l8r `cat`:
  [8plc-I88M7gr8.ansi](https://github.com/pip/Octology/blob/master/gfx/sho/8plc-I88M7gr8.ansi "gfx/sho/8plc-I88M7gr8.ansi")

*P.S.*: I feel confident suggesting that if almost anyone were to read through 8.txt and then examine the other documentation, code, and data files that are
distributed as Octology, they could learn much about GNU/Linux, Perl, and general programming from a sometimes manic, yet still usually competent, game coder.
