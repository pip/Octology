# HBALKg8d:~/.log/FtR.log crE8d by PipStuart <Pip@CPAN.Org> to begin logging mainly hours worked on my Dad's "Fix the Radio" project for Personal Development;
# stRtd8-Nd_d8:hours:summary_description  # HBDLKNbK estim8ing FtR-000 recording mic distance from my mouth to have been maybe around 6-inches usually?
HB5LB0uX-HB5LBxQS:1  :installed Audacity && Opus tools on Akuma && Chun, recorded Script_000.0, compressed the .wav file, && e-mailed the result to Dad;
I2MLCwww-I2MLFbad:2  :use WAV(Microsoft)signed16bitPCM always for Dad && maybe Opus l8r for myself. FTR000B.wav today. 48000Hz to 44100Hz. Edit > Preferences
  doesn't seem to be the place to upd8 that. Dup Nov5th sections 0-2 at 44.1kHz. "Fix The Radio -- 000 -- take B" 3 seconds silence before && after take.
  Tried many restarts && reboots to get Audacity to get past error opening sound device /dev/dsp for recording, checking settings and sample rate! =(
  Much time was taken waiting for e-mails or for Chun to restart herself or Audacity, before I later discovered ALSA over OSS, so rounding down time;
I2NL6dad-I2NL6x78:0.5:reply that paper might have been delayed because address failed to include #6 for my apartment number... and it's curious that the
  8.5 x 11-inch paper was encoded 8 1/2 as just "812" like my address. Just wanting to w8 for feedback from l8st new louder recording for 0 take B =) .
  Mention d8g, fans, busy intersection with non-Sunday 6am-pm 2 buses turning corner twice per hour, plows, semis, sirens, cat, && cough interruptions;
I2QL8888-I2QLATER:0  :sent long e-mail about all my issues, but not counting the time since it wasn't really at all rel8d to recording, as we had planned;
I2QLD8PG-I2QLDeal:0.5:reread all directions && write careful notes, start new time, practice full setup techniques, then record FTR000C, analyze, && send;
J7JM5MJ7-J7JMCfix:7.5:Got Oni's Audacity to record && playback, used Krita to handwrite notes from (T7,C7). The 3-conductor stereo plug goes into the jack
  (I called the plug a jack). All timing is perfect, so shed guilt. For d8, consider Hertz in addition to Phasses to replace Frames. A normal man's voice
  spans 100-900Hz && woman's 250-1100Hz so standard microphones 20-20,000Hz ranges offer plenty. An adjustable scissor-arm microphone holder is what I
  called an armature. I would probably prefer an 8-foot cable, but 6-foot should be enough. The prime foe is ambient noise. Broadcasting 104 "Microphone
  Technique" indic8s 5-inches away maximum. Move in to "eat" the mic from 2-inches away. Turn fans off. Position the mic rear directly at unwanted sound
  source. Physically reduce tactile connection to vibr8ional hum sources. Hold your paper still. Don't fondle the mic. Don't wheeze when breathing.
  Learn to pronounce P's && B's unplosively. We will definitely deliber8 before either of us pushes an "escape" button to get us out of any further
  commitment or oblig8ion, but starting a 100-Day trial period on Friday July 19th of 2019 should give us a good idea.        J7JM9Ger  -Pip
  Recorded "Fix the Radio -- 000 -- take C" with 3-second silence then .wav which I analyzed for differences, then sent to Dad via my Google Drive;
J7KM30Im-J7KM3WAK:0.5:sent e-mail confirming everything to begin the project on Thread 30, recommending LibreOffice Impress, && sharing MicTechnique sketch;
J7KMANIC-J7KMBLUE:1  :replying to T30,C3;

J7SM9vFC-J7SMB1jR:1  :replying to T30,C6;
J7VMFJXA-J7VMGFdT:1  :replying to T30,C9  with FTR-000e.wav Drive.Google link && sending early Birthday MGB drawing;
J89MJU00-J89MK000:0.5:GalaxyS8 phone recording FTR-000f.m4a as test of altern8 to just Oni && Chun Audacity as voice-recording option (approxim8 time);
J8EM1U00-J8EM3800:1.5:replying to T30,C10 with FTR-000g.wav Drive.Google link;
J8GM8Ell-J8GM8ill:0.5:duplic8ing FTR-000 JamesAllen1902 script with handwriting in Krita seems rel8d enough to the Narr8ion Project to warrant time log;
J8OM3pet-J8OM5pet:2  :duplic8ing FTR-000 JamesAllen1902 again vertically into 1080x1920 as altern8ive;
J93MLOW9-J93MNOW9:2  :duplic8ing FTR-000 JamesAllen1902 script with handwriting in 1920x1080p again;
J9KMA888-J9KMEchu:4.5:replying to T30,C14 with FTR-000h.wav Drive.Google link. Also upd8d ~/dox/putr/RsynCore.ls && Chun to rsyncmd FtR along with all muz;
JA4M9000-JA4M9U00:0.5:replying to T30,C17;
JA4MD000-JA4MHDad:4  :replying to T30,C16 with FTR-000i.wav Drive.Google link. Also attached 8 aphorism art .png files in a .tgz for Dad to hopefully enjoy;
JADMHope-JADMII2D:0.5:replying to T30,C20 with FTR-000j.wav Drive.Google link;
JAIM9ear-JAIMACT2:0.5:replying to T40,C17 planning to join a GMail chat session this evening at 7pm my time, 8pm his (since IRC is too much hassle for him);
JB4LH8Mo-JB4LHbit:0.5:sliced open && readd first 8 pages out of 42 of tnp-1901.docx && chatted at JB4LJ000 agreeing to finish the 42 by Wednesday instead;
JB6LGUMS-JB6LHUMP:2  :finished rEading all 42 pages then chatted from about JB6LJ000-JB6LKD00 discussing hole-punches, colors, lamp reimbursement, etc.;
JB8LH0PE-JB8LNX7b:4.5:readd GMail instructing me to please jot down any notes, comments, or questions for clarific8ion;

JBEL8Nat-JBELBrew:3.5:Krita sketched Caesura-1 through C in ~/gfx/Ppl/Dad but should mv all of them into new 'cae/' subdir && re-org other stuff into 'old/';
JBJL74ca-JBJL84ca:1  :Krita sketched Caesura-D much tighter than C. Apparently Caesura Selah sketches probably shouldn't count as FixTheRadio work technically;
JBRL8Idu-JBRLCGrm:4  :rEreadd FtG letter && Narr8ion Project T30,C20 e-mail with directions to record FTG-001.wav from bedroom then listen to it closely;
JC8L0udA-JC9L9999:32 :tried lots of JACK configur8ions alongside PulseAudio && ALSA to hopefully get low-l8ncy recordings out of Audacity or other recorders;
JCCLCCCC-JCDLDIGS:25 :tried lots of JACK connection graphs but couldn't get audio to or from the devices so am falling back on just ALSA && PulseAudio;
K12LC0LD-K12LEARN:2  :readd lengthy LedgerNote.Com Acoustic Treatment article, watched a couple short SoundSpeeds channel YouTube videos on microphones;
  ... record   a few FtG trials in Audacity;
K2SL4aps-K2SL5gJS:1  :discovered that extension cable extended into other room had about -19dB noise-floor,then same room about -33dB,then no extension -40dB.
  Recorded FTG-013 && 014 both right in front of Oni in my computer room with the base-board heater ventil8ion fans off && minimal traffic going by @ ~5:30AM;
