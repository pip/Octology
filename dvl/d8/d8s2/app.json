    "description": "d8s2 is the 2nd test attempt at getting Pip's Octology d8-clock to run as a mobile applic8ion through Expo (1st attempt was just 'd8st'). The d8 is gr8 because only 8 efficient base-64 characters are needed to coherently represent 60th-of-a-second precision over lifetimes. Every 3-character d8 of just Year, Month, Day also can be treated as Red, Green, && Blue components to give each d8 a slightly unique background color to encode values more synesthetically. Eventually this d8-clock (probably renamed 'd80k', like my Curses version but with Zero instead of lowercase 'o') will support a radial rendering of hands rot8ing around a canvas as large colorful altern8ive to the initial monospaced text-mode only. Hopefully other GNU/Linux geeks will someday find d8 as useful as I already do. It could represent a paradigm-shift in universal chronology if d8 could see somewhat widespread adoption. Just having 'Beer' && 'Dope' times every morning && afternoon would complement 'GK' GoodKind 4:20PM; Note:after upgraded to SDK v33, try getting --web version going again too;",
